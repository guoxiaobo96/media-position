Andrew Yang: I'm the son of immigrants myself, so I agree that immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic economically, culturally, socially. That said, I think we should have a rational, principled approach to immigration. At the high end, we should be stapling a green card to the diploma of any student who comes here and studies at one of our universities and graduates. Because a lot of them want to stay here, and we should be encouraging them to stay here and make it easier for them to start a business, start a family, have a life here. We should try to provide a path to citizenship for the 12 million-plus people who are here and undocumented and bring them in to our society. Essentially, you have another legal classification on this path.
Last March, Inslee fought hard but failed to enact the nation's first carbon tax in Washington state. He couldn't whip the votes to pass the bill through his state's Democratic-controlled legislature. This past November, voters in his state rejected a ballot initiative to impose a carbon fee on fossil fuel emissions. A separate push he spearheaded to cap emissions was blocked in the courts.
The Senate Finance Committee holds a hearing on rural health care.
WALLACE: Much more to come live from the Fox Theater, including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country. The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment.
These ideas – which haven't been finalized – could help move the needle. But they'll take time to put in place and the administration would need Congress to pass a bill in order to fully implement the international pricing index it has proposed for Medicare. Trump appeared to recognize that reality, asking Congress to pass such legislation.
We can start by paying women better. Equal pay for equal work is yet to be a reality in many industries, something that the Biden administration might want to take up again after President Obama laid the groundwork in 2009 with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.
Has Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell changed his mind about how to pass health-care legislation?
TRUMP: This little guy has lied so much...
One additional benefit of an aspirational message such as America Can Do Better is that it does not ask Trump voters to admit they were snookered by a snake oil salesman. It puts the onus on Trump, who has not performed as his supporters would have hoped. Don't get me wrong — Trump did con a great number of voters, but voters don't like to admit it, even when the evidence is right in front of their faces. This allows Trump voters to remain convinced Trump was better than Clinton, but we can do better than Trump.
Moments after conceding at a union hall in Prince George's County, Edwards gave a pointed speech, criticizing her friends in the state Democratic Party, which she said is on the verge of an all-male delegation in a so-called progressive state. She said Democrats cannot continue to ignore women and people of color.
When Pence's name was floated in 2008 and 2012 as a potential presidential candidate, a downside among conservative pundits was that voters wouldn't be able to pick him out of a lineup of other white, male politicians.
AHH: The Supreme Court will discuss whether to take up the legality of Obamacare at its Feb. 21 private conference, after turning down a chance in January to fast-track a case challenging the ACA.
People who collect Social Security and do not file a tax return will automatically get a one-time $1,200 payment, the Treasury Department said.
The White House declined to comment on the status of the CMS nomination. Neither Brooks-LaSure nor Cohen responded to emailed questions.
After Trump surprised even Republicans with his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, GOP leaders and the president-elect had a two-month run of fairly solid relations. Vice President Pence, a former member of the House and close friend of Ryan's, emerged as a key player in keeping Capitol Hill looped in on emerging legislative ideas and key personnel moves.

When there are budget deficits and the like, everybody wants to know where is there an additional revenue stream, and one of the most logical places is to go after cannabis and cannabis taxes, Beau Whitney, a senior economist at New Frontier Data, told Katie.

Enough is enough. On Thursday, I released my Prescription for a Healthier Virginia with a bold, aggressive plan to take on this rigged, predatory system. Virginians deserve transparency in drug pricing, accountability from these corporations and their executives, and the peace of mind that they won't be forced to choose between taking their medications and feeding their families.
-- All eyes are on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). Privately, senior Senate Republicans expect the vote to seek witness testimony to fail, but they are watching Alexander and several other Republicans closely. And wherever Alexander comes down is almost sure to be the majority position in the Senate, Politico reports. He's a retiring defender of the Senate as an institution who's occasionally bucked his party, but he also counts Mitch McConnell as a longtime ally. He's more hesitant to criticize Trump than are some other Republicans, but he also has said it was 'inappropriate' for Trump to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents. … [Democrats] are holding out hope that Alexander will be their hero in the mold of the late Sen. John McCain, whose extraordinary vote derailed the GOP's effort to repeal Obamacare.
If you set out to design a regressive piece of public policy — one that literally takes money from the poor and gives it to the rich — it would be difficult to design a policy more regressive than the bills to repeal Obamacare. The Senate's is only somewhat less effective in this than the one already passed by the House.
Republicans failed in their latest futile attempt Tuesday to kill President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, a Groundhog Day vote by the House that was solely an exercise in election-year political messaging.
The result has been a presidency lacking in significant victories, beset by major stumbles — including the downfall of the Republicans' health-care bill and his travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries — and that is the target of litigation as a result of executive actions, especially related to the environment.
For years, China's vast chemical and pharmaceutical industry exploited loopholes in Chinese law to create synthetic painkillers and their precursors that were not explicitly banned, Gerry writes. U.S. officials including Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer have pushed Beijing to significantly broaden its list of scheduled substances to cover the entire class of synthetic opioids, their analogues and precursors, and crack down on their unchecked production and export.
Not long ago, many Republican leaders, even as they were wary of Trump's background and style, had considered his presidency a chance to unify the party around passing a long-sought policy agenda.
That's because repealing Obamacare is a difficult and fraught exercise, for a whole host of policy and political reasons. Such is the case when you're trying to get rid of a massive piece of bureaucracy — and especially one with benefits people have already become accustomed to.
The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee holds an executive session to vote on Jerome Powell to be chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and Randal Quarles to be reappointed as a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The fear among health insurers is that healthier people will leave their plans, and insurers will be stuck insuring sick people — with less in subsidies from the federal government to cover those sick people.
I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, Alexander said in a statement shortly after the trial recessed, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense.
Some Democrats have been complaining the bills are insufficient given the extent of opioid abuse and overdose in the United States. Collectively these bills do not go far enough in providing the resources necessary for an epidemic of this magnitude, Rep. Frank Pallone, top Energy and Commerce Democrat, said in a statement. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer tweeted this:
So, it has nothing to do with her. I think it frankly has to do with the time constraints of the Senate and senators who are trying to get stuff done, as Senator Alexander put forward. This really is -- the timing of the hearing isn't changing the timing of the vote. There's plenty of time before when they had planned on voting with her -- excuse me -- voting on her nomination, and that remains the same, which I believe is January 24th, but I would check with the HELP Committee and with the Senate majority leader's office.
Companies sometimes go through very torturous processes to bring a generic drug onto the market, Gottlieb said.
President Trump says the world never appreciated America:
But CVA is setting its sights even higher. In its most ambitious campaign yet, the organization said it is embarking on a long-term effort to transform some of the nation's most costly policy investments by remaking VA — the country's largest health-care system — and the financing of the nation's military. The group said it wants to cut what it views as wasteful defense spending, such as funding underused military bases.
There are new challenges Republicans should agree to resolve in order to ensure Alexander-Murray meets its original goals of bringing down families' health care costs and stabilizing markets, the spokeswoman told The Health 202.
White House aides have promised for months that Trump would begin to actively work on selling the bill outside Washington but have retreated on those vows more recently.
Economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton recently calculated the direct cost of all this overspending at about $1 trillion a year, or $8,000 for every household in the country. The indirect costs, in terms of lost output due to preventable death and illness and lost sales on global markets because of excessive labor costs, surely add hundreds of billions more.
The shutdown delays almost all federal civil cases, including discrimination cases, whistleblower cases, disciplinary cases and retaliation actions taken against federal employees. It further backlogs thousands of immigration court cases.
And then I think on Monday, you're going to see a big flurry of activity. But over the weekend, there are some things that he is going to do with the staff and I think we're still working on the sequencing of that. But I think you're going to see activity starting on Friday. Some of it routine, meaning that there are certain things that have to happen protocol-wise and logistically to facilitate the next administration.

The consequences of failure would be catastrophic, he told conservative radio host Larry Kudlow on Saturday. But it's going to take senators across the Republican conference to sit down in good faith and work together.
From a psychoanalyst: May I ask which type of fixation you have? (Emma Daley, Harrisburg, Pa.)
A Financial Times editor provided this picture from a Houston gun show:
We don't have a lot of buy-in on the Hill, acknowledged the senior administration official, but we're figuring it out.
The plan that Trump is preparing will come after the House has taken more than 60 votes in recent years to kill all or parts of the ACA to adopt more conservative health-care policies, which tend to rely more heavily on the private sector.
But it's an increasingly dim possibility, given yesterday's developments. The court could still eventually hear the case, but that probably won't occur for many more months, after the lower courts fully consider it. Dach, whose group hounds the administration and Republicans for trying to roll back Obamacare, acknowledged as much.
In an interview with The Post, Wen said changes in the proposal would compromise our ethical obligations, comparing abortion services to insulin for diabetics. I want people to think about what if this were any other aspect of medical care. Imagine if the Trump administration prevented people with diabetes from talking to their doctors about insulin, she said, adding: Whatever decisions are coming up have nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with politics.
First lady Melania Trump wore a jacket that caused a stir on social media as she boarded a plane to Texas on June 21 for a border visit. (The Washington Post)
This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.
Bring back waterboarding, which is widely considered torture, and use interrogation techniques that are a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. Even if such tactics don't work, Trump says, suspected terrorists deserve it anyway, for what they're doing. (Trump suggested after the election, however, that he was reconsidering his position because of a conversation with a general who opposed the tactic.)
At one point, according to an attendee of the party meeting, Price quipped that he used to be frustrated when he was a congressman and Cabinet secretaries gave vague answers to his questions. Now, he said, as secretary, he is obligated to be vague.
A Senate Democratic aide told Politico that the chamber is just waiting for official scores from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to confirm that its version of the bill doesn't run afoul of the rules of budget reconciliation.
For Democrats seeking to improve margins among white voters in the Midwest, the 2018 midterms appear to show a path.
The book's second weakness lies in suggested solutions, which Klein admits are not his strong point. Normatively and as a matter of practical politics, no reform is conceivable that disproportionately benefits one party over the other: His suggestions of congressional representation for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, or abolition of the electoral college, may be desirable in themselves but will never pass until the Democrats take over all three branches of government (in which case our polarization problem will have been largely solved). There are other reforms, however, like ranked-choice voting, term limits for Supreme Court justices or the elimination of the filibuster, that do not have clear implications for long-term electoral outcomes. Ranked-choice voting, in particular, may attract Republican support and is my leading candidate for reform.
When you're talking about al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and elsewhere, they're not governed by the Constitution; but domestic terrorism is, McCaul said. We were very careful how we crafted the bill. We don't get into political thought, free-speech issues that are guaranteed under the First Amendment.
Lock him up! some chanted as Cotton defended the president's foreign policy and ticked through the list of world leaders Trump has met with. They were putting a twist on Lock her up! — a popular anti-Hillary Clinton chant at Trump campaign rallies. Others tried to drown them out with U.S.A.!
Or, perhaps, they would offer a more likely response.
-- Turkish battle over 'executive presidency' prompts tensions with the Netherlands and divisions at home, by Kareem Fahim and Anthony Faiola: So far in a rancorous campaign season, the Turkish government or its opponents have invoked Nazi Germany, terrorist groups, fifth columnists and a Latin American dictator. And that was in the campaign's first two weeks. There is more than a month to go before a referendum in April that will allow Turks to vote on a series of constitutional amendments that could give Turkey's dominating leader, [President Erdogan], vast new powers and allow him to remain in office for more than a decade. But already, the poisonous rhetoric surrounding the campaign has aggravated tensions in this sharply divided nation, raising fears about the aftermath of the vote. The tensions have been building for months. Fistfights broke out in the Turkish parliament when lawmakers debated the proposed ­changes. Now, at campaign rallies, the referendum is portrayed as an existential struggle over the nation's future, propelling Turkey either toward tyranny or stagnation. And the anger has surged beyond Turkey's borders, upending its foreign alliances, including in Europe.
OAN, based in San Diego, made its first splash in the opening weeks of the Trump campaign, when the channel became the first to carry Trump's campaign speeches live and in full — a decision followed quickly by the owner's directive that other candidates' rallies not be given the same treatment, according to internal emails.
The true Iran hawks — such as former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — want much more. Bolton has already made clear that he believes the U.S. goal should be regime change. The hawks want, at a minimum, an end to Iran's use of proxy forces throughout the Middle East and its ambitions to be a regional great power.
Bloomberg criticized Trump for marginalizing experts and debasing the value of expertise, which has caused attrition among career professionals in the foreign service. I know that staffs get annoying, but you do need them, he said. And any good businessperson, which Donald is not, … would tell you that you don't make decisions alone. The board would throw you the hell out if that's what you said you did.
PhRMA and generic-drug developers hope desperately that Trump won't propose allowing the government to start negotiating lower prices with Medicare Part D drug benefit plans, an idea The Health 202 recently detailed. When I asked the group's president, Steve Ubl, last week what he fears hearing from Trump, Ubl said he believes the president and drugmakers have fundamentally similar aims.
He insisted a plan would emerge before the presidential elections. We want to run on this, he said. Democrats have already admitted that Obamacare doesn't work. That's why they're out there talking about this sort of amorphous Medicare-for-all. They're not talking about how great … Obamacare is because they know it's broken.
But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.
TRUMP: I know what's happening with the economy. You don't know a thing.
In contrast to Obama, who always played down the number of jobs that would be created by the Keystone XL pipeline, Trump inflated the numbers. The project would create part-year work in four states for 10,400 workers, the State Department determined. That added up to a total of 3,900 annual construction jobs. About 12,000 other annual jobs would stem from direct spending on the project. So that adds up to 16,000, most of which are not construction jobs. (This statement earned Three Pinocchios.)
We are appalled and deeply sorry for what Senator McSally experienced and we stand behind her and all victims of sexual assault, spokeswoman Capt. Carrie Volpe said. We are steadfast in our commitment to eliminate this reprehensible behavior and breach of trust in our ranks.
I asked BlackRock on Tuesday how it intends to follow up on Fink's letter and didn't hear back. Fink and Barbara Novick, a BlackRock cofounder he's named to oversee the firm's investment stewardship efforts, will both be in Davos next week, and I will, too, so I'll do my best to get an answer then.
But not only did Indivior's earnings from Subutex subsequently far exceed expectations, the company has been able to get the orphan drug status also applied to its injectable medication, Sublocade, because they both contain buprenorphine. When I asked Indivior for comment, the company sent a statement praising the medication and linking to studies showing its effectiveness, without addressing the orphan drug designation.
In scoring Sanders's plan, Blahous's study produces one scenario in which it reduces national spending on health care by $2 trillion over 10 years, despite dramatic increases in government health-care expenditures. Sanders's supporters seized on that finding, arguing it showed their plan was a bargain for the nation.
Biden picked Merrick Garland as attorney general.
I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia, Trump said. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the countries. So that's the extent.
Early voting numbers indicate high enthusiasm among Democratic-leaning voters such as young people and African Americans — voting blocs Warnock aims to inspire with a vision of change while not alienating moderate voters in the suburbs who helped carry Joe Biden to victory here in November. To paraphrase the apostle Matthew, Warnock may have to serve two masters, electorally speaking. And his success may depend on his identity as a man who serves God.
President Trump has delivered and will continue to on the issues of health care, border security, and trade, Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said. To suggest otherwise is to deny the facts. We will be running on the president's successes on these issues and a myriad of others.
[Moments after taking the oath, President Trump transforms White House website]
Scientists at various federal departments are prohibited from doing any work — they cannot so much as open an email, our Post colleagues Ben Guarino, Carolyn Y. Johnson, Sarah Kaplan and Lenny Bernstein report.
At the time, based on limited data available about how the Affordable Care Act impacted insurance markets, the CBO assumed that without a mandate, many people, especially younger, healthier Americans, would simply choose to not buy health insurance.
-- Make no mistake: The protections provided by Roe v. Wade are in play. Three years ago, Anthony Kennedy joined the court's liberals to strike down the Texas law. He's been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, who voted in this case to keep a nearly identical law in effect. Abortion will also be a top issue in 2020 Senate races and the presidential election, especially with Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent health problems.
Drain the swamp in Washington and cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. (Trump pardoned several politicians found guilty of wrongdoing. He has also recently acknowledged, even after the 2020 campaign, that the swamp is not yet drained, suggesting that much of the work still lay ahead. Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny and dignity has only just begun, he said earlier this month.)
Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
People looking to sign up for government-subsidized health-care policies overwhelmed a site that was perhaps built only to handle those 20,000 hits the White House site was seeing 19 years earlier. Obama and the Democrats were lucky that the site's failure overlapped with a government shutdown spurred by efforts to block funding for the program, a shutdown that gobbled up much of the media's attention. But Obamacare website nonetheless soon became shorthand for government technology failures specifically and government incompetence broadly. The kinks were resolved, but the reputation hit wasn't.
A congressional report found toxic heavy metals in baby foods.
OOF: Fauci is calling for the U.S. to stick with its two-shot strategy for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
That statement hardly passes the laugh test. The whole point of the measures is to ward off socialism by doing things that can reduce carbon emissions without requiring wholesale government control of the economy. Carbon capture and sequestration stops greenhouse gases from getting into the atmosphere in the first place, thereby allowing the economy to grow by using fossil fuels rather than their more expensive and less reliable renewable alternatives. The McCarthy initiative is a free-market-friendly alternative to the global government socialist mobilization envisioned in the Green New Deal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
Lior Sheffer is a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Toronto.
The tweaked health-care agenda is certainly moving in the direction of traditional Republican thinking, said Gail Wilensky, a veteran health-policy expert who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush and has not conferred with the Trump post-election team. Not with a fulsome leap, but he's definitely moved in that direction.
I also believe I'm somewhat different from some of the other Democrats in the field. And I can't speak to Obama, but I've been on Fox News any number of times. I'll talk to anyone. And one friend of mine, whose mother is an avid Fox viewer, said that Yang is the only Democrat I would support because he is the only one who does not seem to be judging me. That is enough for us to get a critical mass of Donald Trump supporters to get around a solution that would dramatically improve their way of life. They can see it.
The level of death with Ebola — you know, at the time, it was a virtual 100 percent.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on a vote in the House:
Sign an executive order calling for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of killing a police officer. (This in all likelihood couldn't be done via executive order, and Trump never attempted it.)
SPICER: Well, I guess the answer I'd give you, Sara, is that there's three sort of phases to this. There's the committee questionnaire, the FBI background check, and the -- the OGE report. And in all of those cases, we have been working with all three entities to get those in. I think all committee reports are in. They have been. As I mentioned with Betsy DeVos, her paperwork was in early.
Inadvertently or not, McCain has played an outsize role in Trump's political rise. Barely a month into his presidential bid, Trump touched what many in politics thought was a third rail when he described McCain as not a war hero.
Fourth, conservatives object that ACA benefits are funded largely by taxes on the wealthy. That's different from programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which rely on contributory financing: Workers and their employers pay a percentage of their payroll taxes to help fund the programs. This allows enrollees to claim they earned their benefits.
Barr detailed for the first time the discussions he had about becoming part of Trump's legal team, characterizing the idea as a short-lived one.
Republicans have been selling the line they had a way to provide health insurance to everyone at lower cost than through the Affordable Care Act structure. That selling point is false, he said. If you fake some things, that helps. That's what they're doing.
The Trump welcome wagon. Even before the two-week focus on Omar's comments, the White House had been emphasizing its support for Israeli objectives as part of an appeal to Jewish voters who rejected the president in 2016. Some of the loudest applause for Pence came when he reiterated that the administration would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a shift in policy the president had announced on Twitter.
First off, we're talking about an old idea. Like Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, or Woodrow Wilson's noninterventionist line, America First, TDS is an old edifice affixed with the Trump name.

The Supreme Court's announcement yesterday is a political victory for Trump, Leslie Dach, chairman of the Democratic-affiliated group Protect Our Care, wrote me in an email.
The trial will break Friday evening through Saturday to honor Trump lawyer David Schoen's request to observe the Jewish Sabbath. The trial is likely to resume Sunday. At that point, the Senate could vote on calling witnesses or presenting additional evidence, if either side wishes to proceed.

-- Taiwan's 2020 presidential election is kicking off, and it is all about the U.S. and China. Gerry Shih reports: For years, officials in Washington — which is treaty-bound to defend Taiwan against Chinese aggression — viewed [President Tsai Ing-wen] with skepticism, if not outright concern. Now, the political calculus may be shifting at a time when the United States is stepping up its global competition against Beijing. Her Democratic Progressive Party does not recognize a 'one-China' framework that Beijing considers inviolable, and it leans toward declaring formal independence from China — a provocative move that would potentially spark a devastating conflict that also pulls in the United States. But the Washington of today — with a Trump administration staffed by China hawks in several key positions — has warmed up to a woman who is anathema to Beijing.
President Trump brought it up during his own presidential campaign and included the idea in an executive order a year-and-a-half ago, directing his administration to expand types of insurance that are free from some Obamacare mandates.

HOT ON THE LEFT Why Bernie Sanders Shouldn't Run for President Again, from The New Republic: There is a strong case for Sanders abstaining from making another presidential run. The first obstacle is obvious: He will be 79 next Inauguration Day. Basketball notwithstanding, advanced age is a vulnerability for any politician. This is particularly true of a politician who inhabits the Oval Office—and this critique applies to Joe Biden and other potential contenders of a certain age. Second, while Sanders's campaign ignited public interest in democratic socialism, he was hardly the perfect candidate. HOT ON THE RIGHT Fox's Bolling talks of a future Senate run, from Politico: Fox News anchor Eric Bolling may have just signed a new multiyear contract, but he's also eyeing a possible career change: A future run for Senate. For now, Bolling is secure in his job as co-host of the new show 'The Fox News Specialists.' But in a recent telephone interview from Fox News headquarters in New York City, Bolling said that 'when the lights go down on the TV career' he wants to make a primary challenge against a sitting Republican senator in the South.
That statement then spurred more loud reactions from the group — with one attendee in particular prompting this response from the congressman: You, sir, shut up.
In a six-minute speech peppered with y'all's, Handel also never mentioned Trump or health care. We're going to show up on Tuesday, and we're going to rock Nancy Pelosi's world, she said.
One of the more controversial elements of the plan will be to tax small businesses at a top rate of 25 percent. Small-business groups have long argued that they should be taxed at the same rate as corporations.
Klobuchar often invokes her endorsement from the New York Times editorial board. But Warren, whom the Times also endorsed, does not bring it up. She seems particularly cautious about doing anything that might make her look elitist. This also explains why she assiduously avoids using the H-word on the stump – Harvard – even thought she was a barrier-breaking professor at the law school there. Cambridge, Mass., is only 60 miles south of the church where Warren spoke last night. She also emphasizes her preference for Michelob Ultra over white wine.
He said stricter gun laws would have prevented the massacre of nine African American parishioners during a Bible study in 2015 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church a few blocks away.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) pressed Barr in her second round of questioning about his prior statement that the attorney general functions as the president's lawyer. That rankles some Democrats, who worry that it means Barr might not maintain the Justice Department's historic independence from politics.

So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.
I want repeal to work, and the way you do it is you separate into two bills and you do it concurrently, said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who declared on Fox News Sunday that we are at an impasse with the health-care bill on offer before the Senate.
HHS needs to make the obvious and easy decision to appoint Dr. Schuchat as CDC's director permanently, one person wrote.
It's hard to see how he can win back blue-collar voters in the key swing states that put Trump in the White House when Bloomberg has appeared to suggest that farmers and factory workers lack the brain power to succeed in the information economy. I could teach anybody, even people in this room, so no offense intended, to be a farmer. … You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn, Bloomberg declared, adding that factory work was just as simplistic. But in the information economy, Bloomberg said, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It has become a common insult to tell working-class Americans they should learn to code, but Bloomberg implied they didn't have enough gray matter to learn to code.
Millions of Americans are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive.
As part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays billions of dollars to insurers to help lower-income Americans cover their deductibles and out-of-pocket health-care costs. The Trump administration has not been clear about whether it will continue making those payments next year, as they're tied up in an ongoing legal challenge.
The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment. And what happened? When I was there, the jobs were exploding. Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it. When I went to Ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs. It's the same formula.

Barr was formally introduced to the committee by former senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who praised the former attorney general effusively.
Campaign advisers say they have come to trust Trump's political instincts, though they also recognize that he sometimes goes too far. Still, they say, they can only control what they can — and that often does not include the president.
NOT WORTH IT: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw down a controversial marker in an interview with my colleague Joe Heim in an interview for The Post magazine: she's not for impeaching Trump, even though the speaker believes he is unfit to serve as president.
The Post's video team had a satirical take on the Sinclair marketing promo:
Executives at today's hearing are expected to argue the proposed rebate rule would mean premium hikes for all seniors, and some of the companies teased their comments yesterday, the last day of public comment on the proposed rule.
Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.
Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will also testify tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee on Russia's 2016 election interference.
We could do it a heck of a lot better than him to make them feel more secure, he said. They really understand that he is ­trying to make this a political issue.
Paul — the sole Republican 'no' vote in January on a budget measure touted as the Senate's first step toward repealing Obamacare — has gone on to belittle the AHCA for directing taxpayer money to insurance companies.
Five years ago, Rep. Paul Ryan stood on the House floor, assured of victory. This is our defining moment, he said.
We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.
In Cremona, the coronavirus blitzed through a generation in a matter of weeks, they write. It killed more than 100 of 400 residents in the local nursing home. It forced this city to rush-order eight refrigerated trailers to hold the corpses. It created a horrifying landscape of ambulances racing to the private homes of seniors, who were dying at a rate 400 percent above the norm.
Still, Trump has also used the platform of the virus response to make unprompted references to the construction of a border wall, regularly mentioning the campaign promise during televised coronavirus briefings.
Christopher Robertson, a health law expert at the University of Arizona, told me he'd give the ACA a solid B because of its coverage expansions. But it didn't tackle health-care costs, and those have been growing unabated ever since the law's inception, he noted.
Bloomberg has been critical of the Affordable Care Act, though one of his main sticking points is that it does not go far enough in providing access to health care. As mayor, he wrote an op-ed for the New York Daily News supporting Obama's call for a public option in 2009. The proposal was left out of the final legislation after then-Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) threatened a filibuster.
CVA's aims — once considered fringe in the veteran community — have gone mainstream under Trump.
They're creating a significant amount of financial upside for doing the right thing, Boehler said.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN'T BE OVERSHADOWED:
And come to think of it, didn't Sanders promise to endorse Biden if he lost? I thought the deal was that the losing Democratic candidates would support the winner, no attempt to extort policy concessions needed.
Still, the chyrons that get the most attention — and occasionally go viral — are short and simple. As lawmakers reacted to Trump's cozy Helsinki news conference with Vladi­mir Putin in mid-July, CNN's chyron simply read: OUTRAGE.
The ban on selective abortions, the judges said, runs contrary to Roe, which says states cannot prevent women from obtaining abortions before the point at which a fetus could survive if born. The provisions clearly violate well-established Supreme Court precedent holding that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to viability, Judge William Bauer wrote.
Now known as the ChyronHego Corp., the Long Island firm is one of a number of companies that sell chyron-making systems, but it doesn't mind the way its name gets tossed around. Why wouldn't you want to be the first name that people think of when they think of this product? asks Jim Martinolich, the company's senior product manager.
Why does Congress keep recycling stopgap spending bills? If legislators followed the law, Congress and the president would have enacted 12 appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began last October. As you can see in the figure below, it's been 20 years since Congress last finished its spending homework on time. Polarization, divided party control and internal fissures all make this difficult, even in good economic times. Recently, controversial amendments on the Confederate flag and employment discrimination have upended the budgetary process in the House. And partisan differences have stalemated spending bills in the Senate.
The change comes amid escalating criticism over the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, and as lawmakers have focused some of the criticism on rising insulin costs specifically. The move offers a compromise to critics who have called on drugmakers to lower their list prices, Katie writes. Lilly will continue selling Humalog at its regular price to the insurers and employers who want to keep pocketing the large discounts, or rebates, they receive for purchasing brand-name drugs, while also making available a cheaper version to patients who pay for their insulin out of pocket.
In any case, the majority of Americans would not be affected by the changes. Those who obtained coverage through a new employer or through Medicare or Medicaid — the federal programs that provide insurance to the elderly and the poor — also would not be penalized for suffering from preexisting conditions.
In his floor remarks, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said any hint of credibility Chad Readler might have had as a judicial nominee disappeared the minute he put his name on the Trump administration's absurd legal argument that protections for preexisting conditions are unconstitutional.
He doesn't seem to be as intelligent as he thinks he is, Spriggs said. That's bad. It's bad for the country.
And that was before he even took a single question!
They have the right to jump in and lose, she said. That's fine. They will lose. Horribly.
Obamacare is something that's not going to be replaced unless the courts would declare it unconstitutional, Grassley told them. You won't know that for a long time.
3. Let's repeal Obamacare and spend the next two years on a replacement. Except: That's untenable to moderates and the entire health-insurance market.
Trump's goal is uncertain, however, with respect to Medicaid, the insurance for low-income Americans run jointly by the federal government and states. Under what is known as a Medicaid best price rule, pharmaceutical companies already are required to sell drugs to Medicaid as the lowest price they negotiate with any other buyer.
As usual, Trump inflates the number of people attending one of his rallies. The Detroit Free Press reported that night that DeVos Place in downtown Grand Rapids, where Trump held a midnight rally, has a capacity of 4,200, far less than the 32,000 he claimed. Clinton held her rally the same day at nearby Grand Valley State University; it was described as a capacity crowd at a venue that holds 4,100 people.
White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a Republican former congressman who helped found the Freedom Caucus, was at a loss Sunday to explain why so many of those members were not prepared to vote for the health-care bill.
Some lawmakers who had initially planned on objecting to the electoral college results changed their minds after the violence at the Capitol, which was incited by false claims of election fraud from President Trump and others. But 139 Republican representatives and eight Republican senators voted against certifying the results.
Without a clear ally in the White House, state insurance commissioners are playing a big role in trying to fill in the holes themselves. Kreidler said he hopes to be able to announce early this week that he's enticed insurers into Washington's two counties that currently lack any.
It does raise questions about your willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts, Feinstein said, adding that she feared it also might show a determined effort . . . to undermine Bob Mueller.
So, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.
-- The budget would slash student loan programs and offer tax breaks for private school tuition, offering sharp contrasts to the education proposals pushed by Democratic presidential candidates. Overall, the administration wants to cut the Education Department's discretionary spending by 7.8 percent, replacing funding for 29 education programs – including more than $24 billion in spending – with a single block-grant program totaling just over $19 billion.

The bulk of the challenges have occurred with three initiatives designed to get cash to struggling Americans: $1,200 per adult relief payments that launched this week, $349 billion in Small Business Administration loans, and $260 billion in unemployment benefits for the more than 22 million people — and growing — out of work.
Despite Collins's record as an abortion rights Republican and defender of federal funding for Planned Parenthood, her critical vote on Kavanaugh lost her the trust of Maine's Planned Parenthood campaign arm, wrote Margot Milliken, chairwoman of the state chapter, in an op-ed for the Portland Press Herald on Saturday, Colby writes.

Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life, Trump said. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God.
We've cut education, both higher and public [K-12] education, said Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax) during a six-hour debate on the Senate floor. We've cut student aid, public safety, mental-health programs, programs for the disabled, programs to have a reliable election system. And why have we made these cuts? We've made them to deprive low-income people of health care.
Right now, however, he doesn't register in the early polls.
-- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) expressed hope that four Republicans still might be persuaded to vote for witnesses. Just about every Republican's eyes were glued on Mr. Schiff, he said. It was a powerful rendition.
The public seems to want Barr to reveal everything. In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted in November and December, roughly three-quarters of adults said the report should be made public in its entirety, including two-thirds of Republicans. About 9 in 10 Democrats said they felt the report should be made public.
Winning conservatives in other countries know this too. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a historic majority in December by tacking right on issues such as Brexit and immigration and toward the center on public spending and climate change. He has promised to cut Britain's carbon emissions to a net zero by 2050. Johnson knows that he needs to build a majority coalition to govern, and that majority includes voters who want to address climate change without tanking the economy.
Asked whether current laws were adequate, Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee: The men and women of the FBI have proven time and again that they will work with the tools they have and they are resourceful and entrepreneurial and we've had remarkably good success at disrupting attacks using the tools that we have.

The farm cooperative Land O'Lakes, which is expanding its association plan to farmers in Nebraska and Minnesota, has said its premiums will cost 25 percent to 35 percent less than plans sold on Nebraska's ACA marketplace. Every category of essential health benefits — which are required for marketplace plans — is covered, according to an analysis by Modern Healthcare.
Expand marketplace subsidies for people in lower income brackets. Those making up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level could get fully subsidized premiums.
In defending the program, Bloomberg claimed on PBS that all of the 9/11 attackers came from the same place. Of the 19 hijackers who carried out the terrorist strikes, 15 were from Saudi Arabia, two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Lebanon and the tactical leader, Mohamed Atta, was from Egypt.
In his victory speech, Van Hollen promised to emulate the beloved Mikulski in that regard.
The pair said they have started the process for a discharge petition, which would require at least 218 signatures in the House to pull a bill out of committee and force a floor vote. The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require health-care providers to provide the same level of care to infants born during an abortion procedure as they would to any other infant and would require doctors and hospitals to report violations to law enforcement.
— Meanwhile, Chinese health officials have advised people in Wuhan not to leave.
Trump: Now that the individual mandate is officially killed, people have no idea how big a deal that was. It's the most unpopular part of Obamacare. But now, Obamacare is essentially … You know, you saw this. … It's basically dead over a period of time.
TRUMP: So — because we got to make the country rich.
-- A longtime opponent of the Endangered Species Act was selected to help oversee the Interior Department's wildlife policy. From Darryl Fears: Susan Combs, a former Texas state official[,] … compared proposed endangered species listings to 'incoming Scud missiles' and continued to fight the Endangered Species Act after she left government … Combs was selected by Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke as acting secretary for fish, wildlife and parks. Zinke made the move after his bid to make her an assistant secretary for policy, management and budget stalled in the Senate.
To observers on the right and left alike, OAN's chief goal seems to be to press the conservative cause. Obviously, they're not in it for the money, because they're bleeding money, said Armstrong Williams, the conservative commentator and TV station owner, who gave the Herrings advice as they were launching OAN. They're believers; they care about balancing the media. I saw them as good guys, a little green, without a full idea of what this was going to cost. It's amazing they're still up and running.
A Maryland filing sought to delay a hearing in the NAACP's suit against the U.S. Census Bureau. The lawsuit alleges that the lack of preparation for the 2020 census will result in an undercount in communities of color.
Yale -- Bandy's employer -- issued a statement that was critical of her yesterday. The school affirmed the academic freedom of faculty but said doctors should conduct an examination and obtain proper authorization before publicly stating a professional opinion about a patient.
But we've been down this road before, to some degree, and the lesson is clear: Never underestimate Congress's ability to gridlock itself. Remember the sequester that was supposed to be so bad that it would force Republicans and Democrats to come together to work out a budget? If they didn't, then big, automatic spending cuts would be instituted! And that's exactly what happened.
Republicans have a 52-to-48 Senate majority, and it appears it will be a tough task for Democrats to persuade enough GOP senators to oppose a defunding bill.
Trump's theoretical presidential bid is submarined after gaining little traction in polls and after Obama mocks him relentlessly at the White House correspondents' dinner.
— For some federal workers, the ongoing partial government shutdown has put a strain on the financial resources they need for health care and medication. Mallory Lorge, an Interior Department employee who has Type 1 diabetes, told NBC News's Phil McCausland and Suzanne Ciechalski she's had to start rationing insulin because she can't afford the $300 co-pay while her paychecks have been paused.
If Democratic are nervous Trump will skewer Warren over her ancestry, they should be petrified about what Trump is going to do with the socialist affiliation of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It will frighten voters and transform the election from a referendum on Trump to one on socialism. The future for them, Trump already insists, would be Venezuela.

So you get a lot of money from the government in various ways. You enjoy tax exempt status from the government. So we are going to now hold your feet to the fire and say you have to get your ratios down. Not going to do it all at once, but get your ratios down over this period of time. The universities will say, This is impossible. We can't do it. And then you'll look at them and say, Well, I think you'll figure it out. And as they do figure it out, we will realize that a significant proportion of these administrators have zero impact on the student experience. Students will not even notice that they're gone and that these schools just needed someone to actually hold them accountable for annual price increases.
Former vice president Joe Biden said March 16, I have the most progressive record of anybody running. (Reuters)
That's the CBO's estimate of how much insurance premiums would rise for elderly, poor people over the next decade if Republicans' second version of this bill became law. In a report filled with brutal numbers for Republicans, this may be the most brutal. (Just like it was in the first estimate.)
Institute a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. (Trump signed an executive order to this effect in 2017 but revoked it overnight.)
After we get the $1,000 a month, if we manage to sneak into Jeff Bezos's bank account and give him $1,000 a month, what impact would that have on the U.S. economy? Zero. He wouldn't even know. No one would know. It just be like a digit changed. If you put $1,000 a month in the hands of one of the 78 percent of Americans who's living paycheck to paycheck or the 50 percent-plus who can't afford an unexpected $500 bill, what is that impact on the economy? We know they're going to spend virtually all of it, and they're going to spend most of it where they live. And that money is not going to stay just in that one transaction. It's going to circulate over and over again.
Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, said: While the Trump budget includes several budget cuts that we cannot support, ending HIV is something we can all support. This opportunity is too important to squander. Now is the time for Congress to work together and invest the necessary resources to end HIV once and for all. Schmid is also co-chairman of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.
Reconciliation is a special congressional procedure allowing legislation to bypass a Senate filibuster, meaning it would need only a simple majority of senators to pass rather than a 60-vote supermajority.
Perhaps even a basic monthly living stipend — or freedom dividend, as Yang proposed.
So you will continue to move at repeal, is what I gained from that conversation, she replied.
But sometimes, even the most careful lawmakers get it wrong. That actually happened recently with Republicans' attempt to undo Obamacare, explains Reynolds.
I didn't think it was an adequate predicate, Barr said. He disputed the idea that his memo was meant to forge a relationship with the White House in hopes of getting a job.

She expressed frustration about Trump's push to repeal Obamacare (she's a lab tech) and blamed him for the recent government shutdown. But she was particularly disappointed in his treatment of immigration.
Surfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.
Last week, the administration declared the virus a public health emergency; began on Sunday barring non-U.S. citizens who recently visited China from entering the United States, subject to a few exemptions; said it would quarantine any Americans who had visited China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, within the last 14 days; and would require screening and self quarantines for Americans who had recently visited other parts of China, Erica and Yasmeen write.
Take those steps to eliminate the most significant and immediate drivers of market uncertainty and you'd go a long way toward shoring up the state marketplaces for 2018, Kreidler wrote.

Sen.

Conservative media turned 2021's National Read Across America Day into an epic culture war meltdown, writes Vox's Aaron Rupar. If you watched Fox News or Newsmax yesterday, you'd be excused for thinking that a controversy over children's author Dr. Seuss was the biggest news story of the day, he notes: Both networks ceaselessly harped upon the purported 'cancellation' of [Dr. Seuss] as the latest example of woke liberalism run amok — conveniently ignoring the fact that Dr. Seuss has not, in fact, been canceled.
Barr said it was not uncommon for him to share his view on a legal matter with the Justice Department. He said he called three times — twice to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and once to Rosenstein — to raise critical questions about the prosecution of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).

Basically . . . 90 percent of our members of the conference were there and ready to go and be a governing party and were happy with where we were, and around 10 percent were still in what I would call 'opposition party mode,'  Ryan said on the call. About 10 percent of our people, a particular bloc, just weren't there yet, even with the president's involvement.
TRUMP: I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.
Negotiate trade deals with individual countries instead of regions. Trump would gather together the smartest negotiators in the world and assign them each a country. Billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn would be in charge of trade negotiations with China and Japan. (Icahn advised on regulatory reform but quit without holding a formal position. There is no evidence that individuals such as him were hired to handle trade deals with specific countries.)

This possibility is looking dimmer by the second. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who last fall negotiated an agreement to fund the CSRs with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), isn't so enthused anymore about the bill.
These polls may not be perfect illustrations of what Trump and Paul are proposing; Paul's idea seems to be that the plan to replace Obamacare would be worked out beforehand and then simply voted on separately, after repeal, and Sasse has floated a one-year delay on Obamacare shutting down. But the practical implication would be pretty similar: The law would be repealed without a clear replacement in-hand. And the gambit would be at the mercy of whatever happened thereafter.
Barr repeated that he wants to get as much as I can of the information to the Congress and the public, and added that he did not know what conversations Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein may have already had on how to make a public announcement.

Murray said if Republicans continue to say no to everything … then it's detrimental and we'll have to figure out how I move forward.
The tensions underscore Democrats' struggle to discern the best way to respond to Trump and the GOP's attacks on their far-left flank, criticism frequently centered on women of color. The president has made Omar (Minn.) and Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) favorite foils, accusing all Democrats of becoming socialists like Ocasio-Cortez or anti-Israel, as Omar frequently criticizes Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians.
He didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts, Trump said. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.

The cost-sharing reductions are sure to come up when insurers meet Tuesday with Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; attendees will include the lobbying groups America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, as well as individual insurers such as Molina Healthcare.
First, the condition of the country could certainly improve, the anti-Trump message proclaims. We can always be freer, more prosperous, more united and more respected in the world. More specifically, our infrastructure is still crumbling, our public schools are still lagging our global competitors' schools, wages are still relatively flat for many Americans, our immigration system is still broken and race relations, most Americans say in polls, are poor. Most Americans would like, for example, a better health-care system (which is what Trump promised) — although they've grown more fond of Obamacare with time.
AHH: Among all the conservative changes the Trump administration is considering for Medicaid, it's also contemplating allowing lifetime limits on health-care benefits similar to caps in place for federal welfare benefits, McClatchy's Tony Pugh reports. Such a move would add to the list of potential new requirements states could start imposing on recipients, as the administration seeks to put some more fences around the safety-net program.
— Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) -- who acknowledged last week that Republicans don't have a viable plan to replace the ACA that could pass this divided Congress -- is sending Attorney General William Barr a letter today chiding him for refusing to defend the law in court and saying the White House should instead propose changes to it or again seek its repeal.
Such splits could be exacerbated by the divide over Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, further challenging Democratic organizers who for now can't even contact voters in person.
Perhaps following the mantra of former Obama White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to never allow a crisis to go to waste, the Trump administration has moved with speed to advance the president's goals as a pandemic upends much of the country and renders traditional campaigning impossible.
The White House received some criticism for its lack of press access. The daily briefing yesterday was conducted off-camera and without audio, which had reporters fuming:
Again and again, Klobuchar went back to her message: She's someone who can run and win in red states and govern by bringing both sides together. On opioids, she demonstrated a remarkable, granular understanding of the issue. Her answer on abortion was vigorous, directing her fire at Trump for promising to punish women and/or doctors. She was forceful on voting rights and voter suppression as well. She cleaned Steyer's clock for his rejection of the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, turning it into a discourse on governing in the real world and knocking Trump for offending and alienating the entire world. (He blames the King of Denmark; who does that?)
And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting. The private sector creates jobs. The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.
Ryan, acknowledging that Trump has had a bad two weeks, said during a radio interview on The Hugh Hewitt Show on Friday that it's way too early to be talking about the midterms. But he conceded, If we don't keep our promises, then we'll have a problem.
The newest class in Congress heralds a redrawing of the battle lines in the ever-contentious fight over abortion, my Washington Post colleague Julie Zauzmer writes. Not so long ago, many moderate members of Congress broke from their parties over this deeply felt issue. Now, Republicans who support abortion rights are 'nearly extinct.' Democrats who oppose abortion are a 'dying breed.' 
With the House poised to vote Thursday on the first potential changes, these replies offer a window on what's at stake for many ­Americans.
Throughout the course of the day, Trump incorrectly attacking the late-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for leaking the dossier about Trump's ties to Russia and criticizing General Motors and a union leader by name, urging them to reopen their manufacturing plant in Lordstown, Ohio.
It's tempting to say this serves Sanders right, since it proves that the working class — or the 10 percent of it that belongs to unions — is as much of an obstacle to single-payer as the greedy insurance companies. Unions were even ambivalent about Obamacare, because its coverage expansions for the poor were to be partly financed by a very modest tax on the value of their (usually) more-generous health plans. Years of union lobbying, in de facto cooperation with insurance, fossil fuel and drug companies, as well as congressional Republicans, got that tax repealed last year.
Mixed bag: The comment quickly drew criticism from rank-and-file liberals eager to begin impeachment proceedings but also from Democrats on investigative committees who were surprised that the speaker would all but rule out impeachment just as they were starting their investigations, my colleagues Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report.
Another speaker was future solicitor general Ted Olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. I didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, Olson told me, but I did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. In his address to that first symposium, he said: I sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. Of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. But I think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.
-- Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox & Friends this morning to attack the Democratic managers. It's a complete show on the part of the Democrats, and they should be sued for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and they should pay for that hearing, he said.

They wanted to allow insurance companies to lower premiums for the young and healthy — while denying that the inevitable consequence would be higher premiums for the old and the sick.
Impeachment, Gordon said, was tantamount to an active coup and should be given as little credence as possible.
Trump's defenders should see some blinking red lights ahead. If the shutdown continues, if the trade war drags on and, worst of all, if the economy does backslide, Trump's base may flee in greater numbers. This should be instructive for Democrats: Focus on the workers whom Trump won't allow to be paid, reach out to farmers whose income Trump slashed and present the sort of economic program that Trump could have followed to great success. Call it fairness or justice or whatever you please. It is now plain for all to see that the one most responsible for rigging the system against ordinary Americans is Trump.
But it's also clear that McConnell's position has changed, even though he will not acknowledge it, Glenn continues. He was against the reconciliation process for health care in 2010; he has embraced it now. He was against secrecy and closed-door dealmaking before; he now oversees the most secretive health-care bill process ever. And he was against voting on a bill that was broadly unpopular — and now he is pushing for a bill even more unpopular than the ACA in 2010.
Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.
If they were forced to participate in the system they created, they would make it work, Riffle said.
Thanks to the court's scrambling of the congressional map, both Lamb and Saccone may well become candidates in new districts for the November midterm election before a winner is declared in this 18th Congressional District race. Candidates must collect and file 1,000 signatures for those races by March 20 — the day that some overseas ballots in Tuesday's race will be counted.

Reports that the former president urged Democrats not to propose anything they couldn't pay for and pass have not been received very well on the left.
There is one message that former vice president Joe Biden may be reluctant to use but that Bloomberg can hammer home: Trump is mentally unfit to hold office — any office, but especially the presidency.
RUBIO: ... but when you have chances to help the American workers, you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas.
-- The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration and states challenging Obamacare to respond by Friday to an appeal filed by defenders of the health-care law. From NBC News: Such a highly abbreviated timeline — the rules normally allow a month for filing a response — gives the court the option to take up the case during its current term, which would mean a ruling on a contentious issue this spring, just as the presidential campaign heats up. Nineteen blue states, led by California, asked the Supreme Court last week for a quick decision on whether to take the case. They're appealing last month's ruling by a federal appeals court that said Obamacare's individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law cannot survive without it.
As Ronald Brownstein recently detailed, data compiled by the Urban Institute shows that there has been a large expansion in coverage among non-college-educated whites in Rust Belt states that flipped from Obama to Trump (Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) and even in some core Trump states (Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas). Note that all of those states except Wisconsin expanded Medicaid — it's reasonable to surmise that this played a big role in the huge drop in uninsured among those voters.
From our perspective at DLA, we are in it for the long haul to defend Safehouse and to advocate for its legal rights to be able to go forward in its lifesaving mission, said Ilana Eisenstein, a partner at law firm DLA Piper, which is representing Safehouse for free.

She worries that the House GOP's legislation will again render insurance unaffordable, in part because it would allow companies to charge older customers as much as five times more than younger ones.
A few blocks away in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of the mostly black city, I met retired physician Tom Powell, 85, crossing the street. Powell explained that he couldn't stand Clinton and almost didn't vote for her since Maryland would give its electoral votes to the Democrat. (This, too, was mentioned by several of those I spoke with, given that these conversations were in Maryland, New York and D.C.)
AHH: Biden slams Neanderthal thinking as states roll back pandemic restrictions.
I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.
RUBIO: When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.
— There was also discussion around drug rebates, which the Department of Health and Human Services has targeted as a cause of high drug list prices. Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, explained the current rebate structure allows higher list prices for drugs and higher rebates that push more than the fair share to the patients that take expensive drugs, adding that those patients pay more than the negotiated price.
Some Republican senators downplayed the idea that the 2010 health-care law was immediately at risk and said they would work to make sure those with preexisting conditions would be protected no matter what.

On the other side of the Medicaid divide stood Del. Glenn R. Davis Jr. (R-Virginia Beach). He said he had intended as recently as the day before to oppose the measure, but changed his mind.
There were detractors to Pence; his speech prompted some of the sharpest partisan volleys in the recent history of the conference. History warns us against letting anyone use the Jewish community as a pawn in a political game, said Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What is politically expedient today may not be tomorrow when you're dealing with a leader who lacks any genuine understanding of the history of anti-Semitism, racial hatred and white supremacy.
Shalala: I think we'll get to a place where we'll get some Republican votes — depending on where they're from — for bipartisan fixes. For instance, my predecessor Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the ACA because of the number of people in our district.
-- The administration's budget proposal, expected Thursday, would shake the government to its core if enacted — scaling back numerous programs and reducing the size of the federal workforce. Damian Paletta previews: If enacted, this would be the first time the government has executed cuts of this magnitude — and all at once — since the drawdown following World War II. Aides say that the president sees a new Washington emerging from the budget process, one that prioritizes the military and homeland security while slashing many other areas, including housing, foreign assistance, environmental programs, public broadcasting and research. Simply put, government would be smaller and less involved in regulating life in America, with private companies and states playing a much bigger role.
But what's sometimes been lost in heated, politicized exchanges is that the Labor Department did ban these plans from discriminating against patients with preexisting conditons. That perhaps reflects a growing realization among Republicans that opposing these popular protections is a political loser.
Yes, Mr. Acting Attorney General, five minutes. And yours are up.

So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly. So where does this come from? Where does it come from?
The majority party assigns a chairman for each of the Senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. But when the Senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its Republican and Democratic leaders -- Trent Lott of Mississippi and Tom Daschle of South Dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, and equal budgets for committee Republicans and Democrats, though the majority leader retained the right to advance a measure or nomination from a committee in the event of a tie vote. There could be an effort to reach a similar power-sharing agreement after Jan. 20.
The state of Colorado has seven of the top 25 healthiest communities and 28 of the top 500 overall, U.S. News's Rachel Cernansky writes.
Cohen strikes again: The new inquiry, by the office of the attorney general, Letitia James, was prompted by the congressional testimony last month of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer and fixer, the person briefed on the subpoenas said. Mr. Cohen testified under oath that Mr. Trump had inflated his assets in financial statements, and Mr. Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank.

The group says that in Texas, for example, a Medicaid health plan saw decreases in enrollment after versions of the proposal were leaked. In California, a Medicaid health plan and providers have said they get calls from enrollees worried about the proposed policy.
In late February, top veterans advocates met with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, hoping to persuade him and the president to keep Shulkin as VA secretary. To their surprise, the White House had invited Caldwell, of CVA, to attend the meeting. Kelly told the groups that Shulkin was safe, but he rejected claims that the secretary was a victim of rebellion in VA's senior ranks, saying Shulkin needed to take control of his staff, according to participants.
There are a few bright spots, most notably that the share of enrollees under age 35 – who are healthier and thus crucial to the marketplace functioning as intended – has remained steady at around 35 percent. But consider these data points.
In 2012, the court upheld the mandate that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty, saying it fell under Congress's taxing power. Roberts drew the lasting enmity of some conservatives when he said the court's job was to save the work of Congress if there was a way to square it with the Constitution.
In any crisis, there's a general willingness to support policies people would not support outside of the crisis, particularly for conservatives reluctant to support robust economic security systems, he said. The question will be how long that support will last.
—An official familiar with party strategy said top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) doesn't have plans to put together a working group to construct an ACA replacement.
It is an astonishing turn in the circumstances of a polarizing law that the House GOP voted more than 60 times over nearly a decade to scrap and almost scuttled in 2017 — and one that Trump remains intent on destroying.
Among the problems taxpayers reported this week were payments being sent to incorrect bank accounts, failures to include $500 checks for children, and not getting money at all due to a technical glitch involving some accounts of people who used tax preparers.
Elsewhere in the city Friday, there were loud congregations of protesters holding anti-Trump signs. Some groups of black-clad anarchists roamed streets downtown smashing windows of businesses and cars, lighting a bonfire and hurling bricks and rocks at police, who responded with loud flash-bang grenades and streams of pepper spray.
As we detailed in Friday's Health 202, hospital networks including Mercy in the St. Louis area and Providence St. Joseph Health along the West Coast are leading the way with remote patient monitoring and consultations as a way to overcome physician shortages and deliver more immediate, specialized care.
This is the largest Democratic advantage on immigration in Pew's polling since 2006. During Barack Obama's administration, neither party held a significant advantage in dealing with immigration issues. (Dems had an 11-point edge in 2017, which was also almost certainly the result of anti-Trump backlash.)
Priebus, in his Sunday appearance, dismissed the episode as a coincidence, and Trump has said in recent days that he has a good relationship with Ryan.
A wild-card element is where Trump stands on the details of replacing the ACA — he has said more about the pieces he would like to keep than his ideas for remaking it. Trump's stance may be clarified after Vice President-elect Mike Pence — a leader in the Obamacare repeal effort during his time in Congress — joins House Republicans to discuss the ACA on Wednesday at their first weekly gathering of the year.

But strange as it may seem, the relief bill itself was excessively optimistic in its assumptions about where the economy is headed. Some 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits in March. The month's drop of 701,000 in non-farm payrolls was close to the peak monthly losses during the Great ­Recession.

Meanwhile, a new Politico/Morning Consult poll finds that support for the bill has dropped six points among American voters nationwide, and more voters approve of Obamacare than of the GOP replacement:
In reality, the Green New Deal resolution has no teeth and wouldn't become law if it passed. So these claims are based on a retracted FAQ about a nonbinding resolution. In these documents, proponents of the Green New Deal mused about ending air travel. As problematic as those lines were, none made it into the resolution. High-speed rail would become an airplane alternative for some travelers under the terms of the Green New Deal, but it wouldn't end commercial air travel. Travelers who prefer flights over high-speed rail would still have a choice. As for cows, Trump is referring to a line in the FAQ intended to be an ironic reference to the effect of cow emissions.
Before appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court — widely viewed as one of his early successes — Trump wondered why the job wasn't going to a friend and loyalist, Wolff writes. In the Trump view, it was rather a waste to give the job to someone he didn't even know.
--What the potential agreement doesn't appear to include: Measures to stabilize the Obamacare marketplaces, which have now sort of lost their bipartisan sheen as Democrats insist on changes after Republicans ignored their pleas to keep the ACA's individual mandate (it was repealed in the tax overhaul).
If carried through, the hardball tactics would make it difficult for Republicans to schedule votes even on uncontroversial bills and nominees, further slowing down the already slow-moving body, Manu and Ted write. There's some disagreement among Democrats on how far to go, given the bipartisan atmosphere following the congressional baseball practice shooting last week. But some Dems want to escalate the fight to highlight the GOP's less than transparent process of drafting health-care legislation.
Faircloth and Williams are not a scientific sample, of course. They were simply two women who happened to be sitting next to an empty chair I found at a crowded campaign event. But they are evidence of how twisted the path can be for individual Iowans as they pick a presidential candidate.
The White House is already facing fierce pushback on some proposals from Republicans on Capitol Hill and the pharmaceutical industry, which will probably go to court to challenge any measure it opposes.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) have publicly criticized how long it took hospital leaders to determine what happened after initially saying the deaths were due to natural causes. In an email to The Post, Manchin said: A year and a half after these deaths, no one has been charged with a crime and we have yet to learn the details that led to these horrible deaths … Family members and Veterans across West Virginia deserve answers.

Even without more hardship exemptions, it was already going to be relatively easy for Americans to duck the individual mandate this year. The IRS had already backed away from a previously planned enforcement increase, announcing in February that it would not withhold tax refunds even if filers hadn't provided information about whether they had coverage in the previous year.
On Monday, Pelosi called Trump's actions wrong, saying, I don't think any president of the United States should use the tragedy of 9/11 as a political tool.
Last spring, as part of its effort to increase the number of ventilators amid the crisis, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 11,200 AutoMedx SAVe II+ ventilators from Combat Medical Systems, which distributes the devices.

Florida agreed to let felons vote. Now Republicans are trying to limit who is eligible, by Amy Gardner
The contrast with Trump is easy to draw, because Trump didn't really view his job as diligently administering the federal bureaucracy. For him, the presidency was a reality television show and politics was a series of symbolic acts. But there is a broader view of the federal government that grew out of the Vietnam War, Watergate and some of the excesses of the Great Society programs, one that President Ronald Reagan gave voice to when he said in his first inaugural address, Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.

Democrats need two Senate Republicans to pass Medicaid expansion in that chamber as part of a state budget, the most conventional route for passage. The House already passed a version of Medicaid expansion earlier this year.
That led the CBO to estimate that American Health Care Act would lead to 14 million fewer people insured than previously anticipated by 2018, the second year of the House GOP bill. Eight million of those 14 million would be people who had coverage through the individual insurance market; 4 million would be people with coverage under Medicaid; and 2 million would be people with coverage through their employers, which also would no longer be required to provide insurance. That 14 million figure grew to 23 million fewer people with insurance by 2026.

McConnell said after the meeting that Republicans are close to having a proposal to whip and take to the floor. His top deputies have signaled this week that they are eyeing a vote by the end of July on a bill to be completed by early that month, with some aspiring to wrap up even sooner. Their comments reflect a growing desire to bring a difficult debate to a close one way or the other.
Bill Pierce, senior director at APCO Worldwide, said lawmakers should learn lessons from the failures of the co-ops as they pursue new spending for association health plans. One of the biggest takeaways from the co-op debacle was that they lacked experience running a health plan, he said. The same risk exists for [association health plans], whether agricultural or not.
The researchers found that you would need to vaccinate 1 in 5 elderly people in New York to bring death rates down by 73 percent. But you can get the same result vaccinating only 1 in 6 people if you prioritize people who don't already have antibodies to the virus, according to Kate Bubar, a PhD student in applied mathematics and quantitative biology, who co-authored the study.
He hasn't done anything, McConnell said. For example, he has not decided to waive any of the sanctions. And I would strongly advise him not to.
-- In an op-ed for today's Times, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo falsely calling her a liar wasn't the worst part of their contentious interview. She said the kerfuffle has diverted attention away from Pompeo's comments about Iran: Here's the relevant portion of the interview: KELLY: How do you stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? POMPEO: We'll stop them. KELLY: How? Sanctions? POMPEO: We'll stop them. He did not offer specifics. Nor did he elaborate, when pressed on how to square his resolve with what [the Iranian foreign minister] had just told me — that all limits on Iran's centrifuge program have been suspended. 'Yeah,' Mr. Pompeo said. 'He's blustering.' … The point is that recently the risk of miscalculation — of two old adversaries misreading each other and accidentally escalating into armed confrontation — has felt very real. It occurs to me that swapping insults through interviews with journalists such as me might, terrifyingly, be as close as the top diplomats of the United States and Iran came to communicating this month.
The governor in question is Brian Kemp (R), who, along with other governors across the country, was responsible for the final certification of the presidential vote.

-- Lawmakers from both parties are objecting to Trump's plan to boost defense spending by skirting federal budget limits. Politico's Connor O'Brien reports: The White House plans to stuff as much as $174 billion of its $750 billion request for national defense for the coming fiscal year into a special war fund, according to reports, allowing the administration to maintain its long-sought military buildup without violating a 2011 law aimed at reining in the deficit. The gimmick is especially striking given that Trump budget chief Mick Mulvaney once fought to limit the very same war account, known as the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. … Unless both parties can negotiate a deal to lift the spending caps, it could mean a quick demise for the military's ambitious investment plans.

— Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner believes Trump will support a bipartisan congressional effort to give states autonomy over their marijuana laws, even though it would put the White House in direct conflict with its Justice Department, our colleague Colby Itkowitz reports. Gardner, along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), introduced legislation that would protect the nine states and the District that have legalized marijuana from any federal interference. This would allow businesses that sell marijuana to operate without fear of prosecution by DOJ.

George H.W. Bush wrote the foreword for Dingell's book shortly before the former president himself died: For the most part, when I hear people complain about the gridlock in Washington and their wish to return to 'the good old days,' I dismiss them as being whiny and shortsighted, wrote Bush, who served in the House alongside Dingell during the 1960s. After all, the most popular show on Broadway in a good many years has been the musical version of the story of Vice President Aaron Burr shooting and killing former secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton. … Having said all that, this wonderful book from my great friend John Dingell has made me nostalgic, too, for a time in Washington that was perhaps a bit more civilized and when compromise was not a dirty word.
Cruz also mentioned this TV show during his 2013 filibuster, joking that President Obama probably thought a show about a Southern, God-fearing family of entrepreneurs who love to hunt was a horror film.

A big part of the problem for Republicans is that, as with entitlement programs, once you give the American people a benefit they didn't previously have, it's difficult to take it away. So the new bill seeks to allay concerns about taking away benefits people enjoy — like the Medicaid expansion and the Cadillac tax on high-quality plans — but also alienates small-government conservatives in the process.

But Cruz was very good at one thing: Political organizing. He made two very smart decisions that ensured he would be able to stick around: He kept his enemy Donald Trump close, and he hired staff that focused narrowly on the hard work of identifying and turning out voters.
President Trump has made lowering drug prices one of his favorite talking points, and his administration released a blueprint to achieve that goal last May. He has tweeted at pharmaceutical exceutives, who will be on Capitol Hill next week to defend their steep price hikes. So far, there has been limited success in curbing price increases, causing Trump to last month summon policymakers, including Azar, to the White House to discuss the subject.
We can see such deterioration in our inability to adapt to changing conditions — the rise of China as an economic superpower, the influx of economic and political refugees, and the threat from global warming. People will inevitably disagree about how to deal with these serious economic challenges, but a country with a working political system would rather, after a modest debate, embrace the obvious compromises, building on what works and fixing what doesn't.
Charles Herring said the shows are the only part of OAN that leans right, a direction he said is based not on his family's political views, but on survey data.
On the first day in office, ask Congress to pass Kate's Law — named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco last summer — to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. (Trump asked, but the Senate didn't comply.)
The House and Democratic states were eager to get the issue before the Supreme Court because the majority that has upheld the ACA in two previous Supreme Court challenges remains.
On Nov. 2, 1994, a landmark New York Times headline read: Socks Can't Be Mistaken for a Dog Now.
-- Experts still can't say whether efforts to limit the spread of the virus will succeed. Lena H. Sun and Lenny Bernstein report: Some early signs are discouraging: Six countries, including China, have confirmed human-to-human transmission of the infection. Those include four cases in Germany connected to a single person ... Cases in China continue to multiply, and five million residents of Wuhan, where the virus originated, have left the city, some of them surely carrying the disease. … Public health officials said Tuesday that they are grappling with a long list of unknowns that will determine how successful they are in limiting the toll of the widening outbreak. Those questions include how lethal the virus may be, how contagious it is, whether it is transmitted by people who are infected but show no symptoms, and whether it can be largely contained in its country of origin.
This month, they and nearly 1,200 other people responded when The Washington Post asked readers how they thought the health-care debate on Capitol Hill would affect them: Do you or someone you know have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act? What do you think of the proposed changes by Congress? Are you concerned about a specific part of the plan? Share your story.
Lake Superior is 1,332 feet deep, but it is not even the deepest freshwater lake in the United States. The deepest is Crater Lake, a volcanic crater in southern Oregon, with the deepest measured depth at 1,949 feet. Lake Tahoe and Lake Chelan are also deeper than Lake Superior, so it ranks fourth in the United States. Lake Baikal in southern Russia is the world's deepest lake. It is an estimated 5,387 feet deep. Lake Baikal is also the world's largest freshwater lake in terms of volume. Worldwide, Crater Lake ranks ninth, and Lake Superior does not even make the top 20; it is the 37th-deepest lake in the world.
Both parties endorsed some form of temporary paid sick leave for workers so that they can afford to stay home to comply with health directives. After that, their priorities diverged. Democrats largely defined the challenge as a health crisis. They pushed for measures to patch holes in the social safety net for those most at risk, and offered more funding for state and local governments and health care workers battling the virus.
Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is one of three federal judges said to be on President Trump's short­list for the Supreme Court vacancy. (10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals /via AP)
Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor: Thank you for coming. We'd like to ask you questions and then post a transcript of the conversation. I thought I'd start by asking about human-centered capitalism, which I think I understand the principles, but I'm less clear on the means to get there. I know you want to measure different things, which might provide different incentives. You want to pay regulators more to even the field. But beyond that, how do you get this major transition to happen?
TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. I've given my answer, Lyin' Ted. I've given my answer.
In his remarks, Smith listed a series of objections to the bill. Let's take a tour through them and offer an assessment. Some of the claims have to do with arcane budget issues, while others reflect a more philosophical dispute. As this is a reader guide, we're not going to issue a Pinocchio rating, but readers should be aware that several of these points are off-base or stretched.
Compared with other presidents, Trump has been more passionate in talking about the unborn, but he's also been able to amass a record of backing that up, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, who said he was one of about a dozen conservative leaders invited to review the speech with the president and Vice President Pence on Monday night.
But Liu Yuejin, a deputy commissioner at the China National Narcotics Control Commission, also pointed fingers at drug culture in the United States and over prescription by U.S. physicians.
-- More than 100 U.S. troops have now been diagnosed with brain injuries stemming from Iran's missile attack on an Iraqi base last month. (Reuters)
West Virginia had the largest percentage increase in the number of young children without health insurance (70 percent), followed by Alabama and Kentucky (51 percent) and Tennessee and Missouri (46 percent). Of those, Kentucky and West Virginia expanded Medicaid.
Maybe not. But I also think there is an argument whereby what Trump is doing makes perfect political sense.
-- China just announced tariffs on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans, airplanes and automobiles, in retaliation for Trump's taxes on that country's imports. Emily Rauhala reports: The plan, which was announced Wednesday, would see China slap 25 percent levies on a range of U.S. goods worth about $50 billion. Though China said the timing depends on U.S. moves, the news had an immediate impact on markets, including the soybean market. … Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 2.2 percent and South Korea's main exchange was down more than 1 percent. In Europe, all major markets opened lower, pointing to another expected slump when Wall Street opens. … Though a response from Beijing was widely expected, the speed of the announcement came as a surprise, deepening fears of a rapid escalation.
The contentious fight to repeal and replace Obamacare is likely to continue on Capitol Hill, as Senate Republicans have indicated that they plan to write their own legislation. Whether it would have similar features as the House bill, or if it would be something entirely different remains unclear.
The goal of the domestic initiative is to reduce HIV transmission by 75 percent within five years and by at least 90 percent by 2030, which would prevent 250,000 new infections.
It's up to the IRS to help HHS and CMS review these waiver applications, providing them with information on whether such reinsurance programs would end up saving the federal government money and, if so, how much. It's a relatively unnoticed — but important — function for the tax collection agency.
This is not just an arcane discussion about numbers. Readers may recall that Democrats frequently attacked the repeal effort with these numbers (using inflated language that the GOP would kick X millions of people off insurance). Republicans fired back, saying numbers could not be trusted. The White House even released a video attacking the CBO, accusing it of faulty assumptions and bad numbers, including faulty baseline estimates.
Many poor people in our country have cash taken from them and then the government says, 'Prove to us where you got the cash,' and then you can get it back, Paul said last month. But the burden is on the individual. It's a terrible thing called civil asset forfeiture. He's a big fan of that.
The notice points to a provision in the 2010 health-care law that has gone relatively unnoticed, even as the Trump administration has tried to reshape other parts of the law. Section 1333 describes compacts into which two or more states can enter, allowing insurers to sell coverage across state lines. But that part of the law was never put in motion. The Obama administration never issued specific regulations on how it could be carried out, and states have shown little interest anyway.
But their actions starting Tuesday to end Obamacare will be far less sweeping, at least initially, than a full-blown repeal of the law.
While Democrats debate the best path to universal health coverage, Republicans appear to remain laser-focused on taking insurance away from as many Americans as possible. They've adopted a multipronged approach, too.
-- The Philippines will end its military cooperation deal with the U.S. From the NYT: The notice to terminate the pact, the Visiting Forces Agreement, comes as President Rodrigo Duterte has warmed up to China while distancing himself from the United States, the Philippines' former colonial ruler. The move also comes as the Philippines has shown increasing reluctance to stand up to China over its territorial claims in the South China Sea. … The agreement still remains in force, but the notice to terminate it, delivered to the American Embassy in Manila, starts a clock under which it will remain in effect for 180 days before lapsing.
BIDEN: NBC News's Mike Memoli reports that Joe Biden will headline two political events this week as a final test drive of the message he could take into the 2020 campaign, one advisers say balances a bold agenda focused on reviving the middle class with an appeal for moving beyond the smallness in our politics. Underlying Biden's pitch is the urgency of defeating a president that he feels has governed at odds with America's values — framing the next election as a 'battle for the soul of America,' as he has put it.
Impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese products imported into the United States. (Trump's trade war did not go that far.)
We looked at the different effects Trump's immigration policies have had on migrant populations:
Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor: Foreign policy. I went through your answers to the Council on Foreign Relations, and I was struck by several times where you said the U.S. response to something should be to join the chorus of other countries. In particular, it struck me as an interesting model for what the U.S. role in the world should be. And in particular, when you were asked what should the U.S. do about Xinjiang in China, you said the U.S. should join the chorus of countries that are calling China out. So I guess my question is, is that all?
FiercePharma notes Saunders said the company would increase prices only once a year and by single digits, and many fellow manufacturers have followed suit. Amgen raised the price on Enbrel (its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug) by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by a respective 6 and 3 percent.
First the opponents, say, 'That's something you can't do,' and then the opponents say, 'You shouldn't have done that,'  Murtaugh said. Then you achieve success and they say, 'Well, it's not good enough.' 
The 95 percent figure comes from taking the quarterly high point of 203,500 stops in the first quarter of 2012 and comparing that with 12,485 stops in the fourth quarter of 2013. His math curiously leaves out the huge numbers from 2011.
For many of the roughly 8.5 million marketplace enrollees, verifying their subsidy eligibility is a straightforward process. But for others it's more complicated, as is the case for those who lost their job in the middle of the year and suddenly experienced a dramatic change in income. The IRS needs a workforce that's actually working to get these cases processed.
-- Energy Secretary Rick Perry denied in an interview Monday that humans are the primary cause of climate change. Steven Mufson reports: Asked in an interview on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' whether he believed that carbon dioxide was 'the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate,' Perry said that 'No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.' Perry added that 'the fact is this shouldn't be a debate about, 'Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?' Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?' Perry's comments fall in line with what [EPA] administrator Scott Pruitt said in a March interview … Both men's views contradict the conclusions of scientists at Pruitt's own EPA as well as NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
And while Republicans are determined to rapidly repeal as much of Obamacare as they can, they have not settled on a replacement plan or on when that plan should take effect.
Gabbard: We have a country that is of, by and for the rich and powerful. This must end.
Biden's rescue package is entering a pivotal phase, with Democrats in Congress putting it through the committee process with an eye on securing a final vote before mid-March. Biden has invited Republicans to chime in but made it clear he's prepared to push the package to passage with entirely Democratic support.
More recently, a conservative Maine state senator last year accidentally helped Democrats override the governor's veto on a measure legalizing sports gambling.
Patel also noted it's still early in the year, saying he disagrees with the notion that it's taking a long time to bring Democrats on board.
In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled June 21 that states may require online retailers to collect billions of dollars of sales tax revenue owed to them. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
It's a situation garnering increasing attention from liberals and conservatives alike. Policymakers from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to Trump to his top health chief Alex Azar have been sounding the alarm that the government and individuals are paying far too much for prescription medicines.
The longer the shutdown goes on, the more these functions could be jeopardized — particularly for Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees whose applications have been flagged by the IRS for additional review before they can receive federal income-based assistance for their monthly premiums. (Under the ACA, people earning between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for varying levels of insurance subsidies.)
Instead, what we get is a financial shell game.
The overhead costs here are substantially low because you don't have to hire administrative clerks and billing experts to chase after money, said Danielle Martin, a Toronto Women's College Hospital physician who supports Sanders's legislation. What matters to people is their net income, not their reimbursement rates.
During the campaign — which few aides expected Trump to win — and the transition that followed, Wolff writes about several instances in which Trump's lack of knowledge and interest in public affairs was evident.
OUCH: President Trump and Republican lawmakers across the country criticized Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and other state Democrats after a video circulated of a state lawmaker defending a failed bill that would have expanded the ability for women to get late-term abortions.
The announcement follows Washington Post stories that detailed Weyeneth's rapid rise at ONDCP — in large part because of staff turnover and vacancies — and inconsistencies and inaccuracies on three résumés he submitted to the government, Robert writes. Early last year, Weyeneth revised dates relating to certain jobs he held, including one at a New York law firm. A partner at the firm told The Post that Weyeneth was discharged because he stopped showing up for work.
Though Barr addressed the drug crisis directly, he effectively dodged questions from Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) about what he would do regarding the administration's family separation policy and the zero-tolerance policy toward illegal immigration offenses his predecessor Jeff Sessions had endorsed.
AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE I HATE OBAMACARE, she wrote in 2015, blaming her own health-care costs on NO GOOD IDIOTS SUCKING THE SYSTEM DRY. The message, previously visible only to her friends, included the line GO TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!
And the worst may be yet to come. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis forecasts that 47 million Americans could lose their jobs because of the coronavirus, which would push the unemployment rate above 25 percent — a level not seen since the Great Depression. Most economists don't think it will get that high, but they still anticipate the highest unemployment in decades. Investment bank Goldman Sachs anticipates 15 percent, before a swift comeback.
Earlier in the hearing, Barr had said, I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt. But in responding to Hirono, Barr said: We have to remember that the president is the one who has denied that there's any collusion and has been steadfast in that. Presumably he knows facts that outsiders don't.
This is ironic because the neck-and-neck race to replace Tom Price, who resigned to become secretary of health and human services, has played out against the backdrop of Congress finally considering a repeal of the 2010 law. Senate Republicans are forging ahead with plans to hold a vote next week, and Democrats are now using every procedural trick available to slow the chamber to a crawl so they can draw attention to the secretive process being used to advance the legislation.
Nonetheless, Ryan said he believed he's had success in normalizing entitlement reform, and allies praised him for doing so.
It also raises the deeper question of whether Anthem might be contemplating a larger exit from other states' Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Unlike many states where insurers are weighing whether to withdraw, Ohio's insurance marketplace has been competitive and performed better financially than the national average last year, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A big question is whether the funding to cover these folks is adequate. High-risk pools were big money losers and underfunded in the pre-Obamacare days, even though many had restrictions, high premiums and waiting lists. A $5 billion federal pool, established by the ACA as a bridge to the creation of the exchanges in 2013, covered about 100,000 people but was suspended when it ran out of money.
— Meanwhile, if the shutdown drags on at the FDA, it could start to jeopardize anticipated new drug treatments, Stat's Nicholas Florko and Ike Swelitz report.
-- A Maryland police officer was charged with murder after, police said, he fired seven shots at a man who was handcuffed in the front seat of a cruiser with his hands behind his back. Rachel Chanson, Dan Morse and Justin Jouvenal report: Police Chief Hank Stawinski announced the charges less than a day after the incident, following the department's investigation. Stawinski said bringing such serious charges against an officer within 24 hours of an incident is 'unprecedented' for the department. … He identified the victim as William Green, 43, of Southeast Washington. Green was killed while sitting in the passenger side of a police cruiser in the Temple Hills area. … Cpl. Michael Owen Jr. is in custody and awaiting a bond hearing, Stawinski said. He is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and associated weapons charges.
In his letter, Whitehouse also asked Barr to be prepared for questioning on a signal moment in the Watergate scandal: when President Richard Nixon, in October 1973, ordered the firing of independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating Nixon's role in Watergate events.
Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.
OOF: After supporting Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) for years, Planned Parenthood is endorsing Sara Gideon, the Democrat running to unseat her.
For the people who are in that tranche of expanded Medicaid, I think it has been very helpful, said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). Nearly one-third of West Virginians are on Medicaid, and the percentage of uninsured has dropped by about 56 percent since 2013.
Privately, McCarthy had told Trump it was a bad idea. He recognizes that the GOP pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare is the political holy grail for Republicans, always just out of reach and ending in spectacular failure in its pursuit.
Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence —- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
The results dovetail with the ongoing trend of children younger than 19 losing their health insurance. The overall rate of children without coverage increased from 4.7 percent in 2016 to 5.2 percent in 2018.
The lesson here is not that candidates lie (that's a valid lesson, but one for another discussion). It's that things change, policy proposals don't make it through the legislative meat-grinder intact, and quizzing candidates on the details of proposals that will never come to fruition is a waste of time.
Because of the tie, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would now need to advance Becerra's nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote that has yet to be scheduled, Dan Diamond reports

Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.
Put another way, Clinton ended up getting more votes overall than Obama did four years earlier. The problem was that those increases were often in states where she was already likely to win. In states that Clinton won by more than 20 percentage points, she got an average of 6,500 more votes per county than Obama did in 2012, while Trump improved on Mitt Romney by 679. In states that she carried by 10 points or less, Trump did better than Romney by 163 votes on average in every county — but she did worse than Obama by more than 650. … As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has pointed out, Republicans have won the popular vote only once in her lifetime [2004] but have held the White House for 10 years.
We want to protect patients from costly surprise bills while preventing undue disruption in the health care system, Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) wrote to stakeholders.
But at the same time, he has encouraged Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill to start moving forward with his package under budget rules that would allow it to pass with a simple majority in the evenly split Senate, rather than having to clear the 60-vote threshold that would be required to overcome a Republican filibuster.
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney, had some things to say about you today.
At the turn of the century, their reputation took another hit after the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom. And while it was bankers and Wall Street financiers who brought on the financial crisis and recession in 2008, the rest of corporate America got tarred with the same brush. This June, Gallup's annual survey found that, among all American institutions, only Congress is held in lower esteem than big business.
— For some patients who had transplants before they enrolled in Medicare, the program may not pay for the anti-rejection drugs needed to keep the body from rejecting a new organ, the New York Times's Gina Kolata reports.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs the panel before which Price testified Wednesday, said he was open to providing the funds but that it would have to be a House leadership decision. It's probably the right thing to do, I think. Otherwise you're going to have insurance companies exiting the market, Cole said.
For the next 18 months, Democratic campaigns unloaded on Republicans.
Under last week's emergency spending package, the government will bear the full cost of testing for covid-19 for all Americans, including those who are uninsured. The package also raised federal spending on Medicaid and health insurance for children in low-income families.
The longer the virus drags out, the worse it will be for businesses. And the longer businesses stay closed, the worse it will be for workers who want to reclaim their old jobs when things get back to normal. That said, many of the businesses that have laid off or furloughed workers have reported to state and local government officials that the cuts are temporary, according to the Labor Department, so business owners themselves at least plan on rehiring.
But: I'm in no rush. I want the deal to be right . . . I am not in a rush whatsoever. It's got to be the right deal. It's got to be a good deal for us and if it's not, we're not going to make that deal, Trump told reporters of a trade deal with China.
Deductibles vary according to the type of plan people buy. Trump appears to be referring to Bronze plan deductibles, which are $6,258 when prescription drugs and medical spending are in the deductible; the deductibles for Silver, Gold and Platinum plans are much lower. Silver plans are the most common choice in the marketplace and have equivalent deductibles of $4,375. The Affordable Care Act included subsidies that helped keep premiums low for most people on the exchanges. Trump eliminated cost-sharing reduction payments that compensate insurance companies for offering mandatory discounts on out-of-pocket spending to lower-income customers. Ironically, that led to even bigger premium subsidies as companies increased premiums to make up for the loss of income.
Ryan tried desperately to bridge that gap. He spent a sizable chunk of his time as leader — certainly more than he wanted to — denouncing or criticizing things Trump said or did. At one point toward the end of the campaign, we calculated Ryan was speaking out against Trump roughly once a week. But after Trump won the election, Ryan never ditched him. Why would he when his legislative agenda and the broader health of the Republican Party was at stake?
The Iowa Democratic Party had set itself a herculean task: Pull off a complicated three-stage tally with often inexperienced voters. To work smoothly, it needed much better training than party officials obviously gave their organizers, and a much clearer script. Instead, there was a lot of confusion about the new paper ballots that recorded first and second preferences, and also a fair amount over the rules that forbid anyone in a viable group from switching candidates on realignment. That included anyone who initially declared as undecided, which the caucus president in Norwalk nearly forgot to tell people.
The FDA said that it is planning to propose guidelines on how manufacturers of coronavirus vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tests should respond to new variants of the virus, some of which appear to be more transmissible and less susceptible to existing vaccines.
--Harris's political identity was shaped as an undergrad at Howard University, a historically black school. The Los Angeles Times's Evan Halper reports: The campus during her time was a cauldron of activism and black pride at a moment in history, like now, when most black Americans were feeling alienated and unrepresented by the White House. … Harris was known on campus, but she was not among the most prominent student leaders. … She was undeniably in the mix, however, when busloads of students went regularly to the South African embassy and the National Mall for protests demanding an end to apartheid.

-- Meanwhile, the president threatened to deploy the military to secure the southern border following his broadside against immigrant caravans. Seung Min Kim reports: It was not immediately clear why the U.S. Border Patrol would need help from the Pentagon at this time. The number of people crossing illegally into the country has plummeted over the past decade and is at the lowest level since 1971. … Later Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that the administration's plans include mobilizing the National Guard.
So I said, That's okay. I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.
Trump arrived in Washington in an uneasy alliance with establishment Republicans, many of whom were willing to overlook his eccentricities if they still were able to make good on shared legislative priorities, including repeal of the Affordable Care Act and tax cuts.
The report said Shulkin, who was fired by Trump in March, was advised about these rules.
-- Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said he has deep concerns related to Neomi Rao, Trump's nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, because of a rumor he heard about her personal views on abortion. I have heard directly from at least one individual who said Rao personally told them she was pro-choice. I don't know whether that's accurate, but this is why we are doing our due diligence, the freshman told Axios.
-- This is a message that conservative elites are thrilled to echo. They'd much rather tout the virtues of the electoral college than answer for Trump's continuing insults toward the late John McCain, the military construction projects that won't get funded because of the president's national emergency, the White House's refusal to comply with legitimate document requests from congressional investigators and the Senate GOP's blockade of a resolution calling for the release of Bob Mueller's report.
There's kind of a joke among liberals here that he was created in a lab, as we always say, because he's this conservative everyman, said Camille Richoux, 26, of Little Rock, a liberal organizer who attended Cotton's town hall.
The notion of giving them a card to take anywhere is, quite frankly, a cop-out, he said. It becomes downright dangerous. You need someone coordinating their care.
The Massachusetts senator led in polls of this state last summer. Now trailing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, Warren is locked in a three-way battle in New Hampshire for third place against an ascendant Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and a fading Joe Biden that will determine whether she stays viable as the Democratic presidential nominating contest moves on to Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday.
I started drafting an op-ed, Barr wrote. But as I wrote, I quickly realized that the subject matter was too dry and would require too much space. Further, my purpose was not to influence public opinion on the issue, but rather to make sure that all of the lawyers involved carefully considered the potential implications of the theory.
It sounds crass. Somebody said, Oh, that's crass. It's not crass.
Republicans are trying to make major strides on health care on the eve of former FBI director James B. Comey's public testimony on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Coupled with talks that have not yet sparked sufficient support for a health-care bill, the looming Comey drama has prompted several lawmakers to wonder if their plans to move forward in the coming weeks could also be thwarted by Trump's lack of focus on the legislation because of the controversy swirling around the FBI and congressional investigations into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Well, I'm generally more sympathetic with Democratic positions on issues, he said casually, and I hated Donald Trump and everything he stood for. He used a four-letter word to describe Trump, a word that was popularized recently when paired with hole.
Among those still waiting for their first check is Khalid Mahmood, 66, an Uber driver in Woodbridge, Va.
With Mnuchin personally absorbed in implementing the first major bailout package, the administration has not made much progress on an additional congressional package that both parties believe is necessary to dramatically increase the size of the loan program for small businesses.

A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job. Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.
Since The Fact Checker was relaunched in 2011, we had missed the start of President Barack Obama's term, and so it was too late to track his 2008 promises. By reference, PolitiFact's Obameter tracked 533 campaign promises and found that he kept 48 percent, broke 24 percent and compromised on 27 percent.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sean Spicer and Jason Miller. Please go ahead.
Tuesday. The House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee holds a hearing about the opioid epidemic on
-- It's finally happening: Sean Spicer is expected to transition from his role as White House press secretary to a more behind-the-scenes role overseeing communications strategy — a move that comes as part of a broader press-shop overhaul and after months of rumors. Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker report: Spicer's anticipated move away from the briefing-room podium … comes amid weeks of Trump's frustration with his communications team, and after the White House had made overtures to a range of Republicans about taking jobs within the West Wing press operation. 'We have sought input from many people as we look to expand our communications operation,' Sarah Huckabee Sanders [said] in a statement. 'As he did in the beginning, Sean Spicer is managing both the communications and press office.' No official announcement has been made about Spicer's move, and discussions concerning his role are ongoing, including whether he would still occasionally appear from the podium.
Within the hour, Reince Priebus appeared on TV to echo Trump's sentiments – placing blame on the shoulders of the Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group , and suggesting that the administration may start simply looking past the GOP majority and try forging more consensus with moderate Democrats in future legislative battles. We can't be chasing the perfect all the time, Priebus said on Fox News Sunday. I mean, sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN'T BE OVERLOOKED:
What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.
This includes self-employed farmers and employees of small businesses whose employers cannot afford health coverage in the existing small group market, insurance analyst and legal expert Chris Condeluci told me.
Barr wrote that he ended up distributing the letter widely with those involved in the case. According to his letter, he shared his views with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein at lunch in early 2018, and later, provided them to Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel. After drafting the memo, he gave copies to them, as well as Solicitor General Noel Francisco.

That follows a dramatic turnaround in the politics of health care. After the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Republicans regularly denounced it as government overreach, pledging to overturn it at the earliest opportunity.
He got shut down by Pelosi, who told Obama, Mr. President, I know there are some on your staff who want to take the namby-pamby approach. Instead, she got the House to pass a version of the bill that had already passed the Senate, and Obamacare became the greatest legislative achievement of his presidency.
The Families USA Health Action Conference begins
-- Two of Trump's senior advisers publicly broke with his stance on withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. From the Daily Beast's Spencer Ackerman: 'We are in Syria to fight ISIS. That is our mission. That mission isn't over. And we're going to complete that mission,' Brett McGurk, the State Department's special envoy for coordinating the war against ISIS, said during a Tuesday afternoon forum at the U.S. Institute of Peace … Seated beside McGurk was Gen. Joe Votel, commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East. … Votel indicated his agreement with McGurk that the war remains incomplete.
According to Coleman, who analyzed 28 association health plans operating under the new rules, a majority of the new association plans are being launched by regional chambers of commerce, four out of five are being managed by a third-party insurance company, and half the plans offer tax-free savings account options.
A Democratic congresswoman went with a different message:
American views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress.
Like many of his Senate Republican colleagues, Cotton, 39, was not impressed by the health-care bill passed by the House. We're going to write our own bill, he said, echoing Senate GOP leaders.
The House passed by voice vote a similar measure last year from Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.).
This is just the latest chapter in our tendency to disguise the costs of government. The assumption is that they can be easily absorbed without burdening the middle class. The resulting complacency is inevitable. It poses two dangers.

Banners and the scrolling news crawl known as the ticker became more common after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — few stations had either in reporting the events of that morning — and by the mid-2000s became almost standard. It was a response to evolving viewer habits and the shifting info landscape, said John Culliton, senior vice president of SmithGeiger, a Los Angeles-based media-research firm.
Though Trump didn't create the deficits, he has played the game with zest, embracing massive tax cuts and sizable spending increases. Politically, the appeal is obvious: something for nothing. Politicians can dispense new spending or tax cuts without paying for them through offsetting tax increases or spending cuts.
We're not going to be able to make the changes to the bill if we're forced into a vote this week, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said in a Monday interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. We just don't have time.
— Cryptocurrencies slump. Bloomberg's Eric Lam: Bitcoin continues to wobble, trading near $11,000 a day after losing a quarter of its value as traders sought a floor for pricing amid growing concern regulators around the world will move ahead with new rules to restrict the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. The largest digital currency rose 1 percent to $10,831 at 12:20 p.m. in Hong Kong after slumping as much as 26 percent Tuesday, according to Bloomberg composite pricing.

They continue to squander their moral authority in an attempt to sanitize the president, said Bernard, who resigned from an advisory group of evangelicals last year after Trump blamed both sides for deadly violence in Charlottesville after a white supremacist march.
OUCH: Purdue Pharma executive Richard Sackler said he agreed with a plan to conceal from doctors the strength of the potent opioid OxyContin, according to emails that were contained in a sealed court deposition.
Briefly touching on immigration, Trump said that building a border wall and curbing illegal immigration remain at the top of his to-do list and that he is spending significant time looking at ways to begin projects, both with Congress and through executive action. He did not disclose what was to come on those fronts.
It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.
It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built.
Van Hollen's campaign took full advantage of the misstep, running ads that conflated the super PAC and Edwards and that made it look as though the president had criticized her. He sent out mailings highlighting his relationship with Obama.
The bill, which passed the House by nine votes yesterday with not a single Republican voting in favor, sends one of the largest economic rescue packages in history to Biden's desk, The Post's Tony Romm reports.
Ocasio-Cortez got into trouble because she made a causal connection — the unemployment rate was low because everyone has two jobs.
It kind of looks like you're in an operating room right now, the Sacramento Superior Court clerk said, in a live-streamed video of the hearing recorded by the Sacramento Bee.
Right now he looks, I don't know, in personal disarray, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. In some ways, he had a successful campaign, 'Make America Great Again,' something that is obviously very appealing to many people.
But Republicans are hardly out of the danger zone. It remains unclear exactly how McConnell will get about five to seven holdout senators to sign off on the forthcoming measure (Politico also has a useful list of senators most likely to oppose the bill and why). Some key members, including Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), don't appear at all certain they're nearing a resolution. Didn't seem like it to me, Hatch told my colleagues Sean Sullivan, Juliet Eilperin and Kelsey Snell yesterday.
Both panels will include parents of patients with Type 1 diabetes who will speak about the especially massive price hikes for insulin. Antroinette Worsham, who will testify before Oversight, had a daughter with diabetes who died after rationing her insulin because she couldn't afford the medication.
Strengthen and expand the use of E-Verify, which allows employers to check an employee's eligibility to work. (Trump retreated on this.)
Bevin treated his conservative supporters terribly, said Phyllis Sparks, a 58-year-old Republican activist who declined to vote for either of the top contenders in the governor's race. He didn't represent me or my values.
Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.
GOP leaders are not even banking on getting all 52 Republican senators to vote for a health-care bill, given their disagreements, differing local considerations and discordant political motivations.
TRUMP: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.
You may disagree with Ms. Clinton about Obamacare, Russia policy or Planned Parenthood. She may, as president, take actions that deeply upset you. But you can be certain that if Republicans take issue with her, she will not order them jailed.
The new study comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week he would reverse an Obama-era policy that discouraged enforcement of federal marijuana law in states where pot is legal. (The Health 202 took a look at how pot will survive Sessions's announcement here.)
There has been virtually no outreach to Democrats about a tax package. Although Democrats like the idea of infrastructure spending, the parties have different visions of how it should be paid for.
Look, we've got a suite of policies that are available to us, not just carbon pricing, he said. In my state, we've got five bills in the legislature that are all moving forward with the goal of 100 percent clean energy. … We've learned that we have multiple tools, not just one. There are a lot of different ways to skin this cat.
I support politicians. In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton. I supported many other people, by the way. And that was because of the fact that I'm in business. I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan. I also supported George Bush, by the way.
The 37th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference continues in San Francisco.
Trump's Thursday performance seemed an acknowledgment, by the president, that he may be his own best press secretary and adviser, and allowed him to appear both confident and comfortable. While many of his comments, as well as the sometimes disjointed nature of his delivery, are certain to alarm official Washington, they are also the sorts of red-meat talking points that delighted his base during the campaign and helped propel him to victory.
But there's a plethora of ways other countries attempt to rein in drug prices — such as by capping how much government plans will pay for them, regulating how much the industry can charge private insurers or limiting markups along the supply chain.

He noted that he defeated a GOP incumbent to win his House seat and said he didn't have support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They flew a guy out to Yakima to tell me they weren't going to help me, he recalled. I said why didn't you just call?
More than 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed in the United States every year, Laurie reports. Under the surgeons' recommendation, almost all those patients would be tested, as would family members whose relatives discover they have mutations, said Taylor. It's not clear how many people are being tested now, but experts said it is far fewer than what the recommendation contemplates.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.
— We now have more details on why the letter from President Trump's longtime doctor Harold Bornstein sounded so ...Trumpian. Bornstein says Trump wrote it himself. He dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter, Bornstein said in an interview with CNN. I just made it up as I went along.
This idea, that Trump's critics are the real deranged ones, has found purchase among many of the former president's allies. I think it's an obsession, Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Wednesday in an interview. It's a level of hatred I've never seen before.
* SPICER ENLISTED OFFICIALS IN RUSSIA PUSHBACK: Axios scoops more detail on White House press secretary Sean Spicer's efforts to debunk recent stories about links between Russia and the Trump campaign:
The panels are charged with crafting the repeal legislation with an eye toward the budget rules, which will determine how many votes the language needs to be approved. The goal is to craft a bill that can pass muster with House conservatives while still being able to meet the 50-vote threshold in the Senate. The sticking point is this: To be eligible for a simple-majority vote, the language must be related to taxes or spending or somehow add to the long-term federal debt.
Political control R Reagan R Senate D House Why it happened A deal on several issues wasn't reached in the time of a three-day funding extension. How it was resolved Congress removed several measures from the bill according to Reagan's wishes, kept his preferred crime funding and negotiated a settlement on funding the Nicaraguan Contras.
The overall rate of workers and job applicants testing positive for illicit drugs last year remained steady at 4.2 percent, the same rate as in 2016, while the mix of reasons for positive tests shifted. Positive tests for opiates such as morphine and oxycodone dropped by 17 percent in 2017, perhaps reflecting new crackdowns on illegal or excessive opioid prescriptions.
Under the ACA, the federal government covers more than 90 percent of the costs to insure the expanded Medicaid population. The GOP blueprint suggests slowly stepping down that percentage over an undetermined period of time, after which states would be reimbursed at their traditional match rates for these ­beneficiaries. Those rates vary from state to state; some receive as little as 50 percent, meaning ­individual states could lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year in federal reimbursements under the GOP proposal.
Proponents of the plan said they're hopeful that Gov. Larry Hogan (R) will support it, noting he was one of 10 Republican governors who signed a letter to Congress last year opposing GOP plans to eliminate the federal insurance mandate.
The Senate Intelligence Committee is now taking similar steps. Yesterday I laid out some of the options that investigators can deploy to try to compel Flynn's cooperation.
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) have introduced a discharge petition, which would force a floor vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act if 218 lawmakers sign the petition.
That's why many liberals would have liked to see the rescue package include new automatic stabilizers, aid to people that would kick in automatically whenever there's an economic downturn and not cease until the recovery was on its way, so that help wouldn't be conditioned on Republican whims. But somehow it didn't happen.
Children coming into the United States pose a separate risk. [T]he American Academy of Pediatrics said it has urged CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to hire medics trained in pediatrics, or at least accept volunteer pediatricians, because children require more specialized care, Maria adds.
Whitaker's responses were barbed accusations: What's the basis for that question? Again, what is the basis? Can you tell me where you get the basis?
McCain at the time was fighting brain cancer, but Trump nonetheless repeatedly derided him. Even after McCain died and received a hero's ceremony in the U.S. Capitol, Trump continued his attacks.
But there are a dozen holdout states that haven't adopted Medicaid expansion.
Dean Heller of Nevada, the only Republican senator who is up for reelection next year in a state Hillary Clinton won, said he worries that Ryan's bill will hurt seniors and the poor. More significantly, he declared that he sees health care as a fundamental right — a principle that conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus explicitly reject. Do I believe that all Americans should have access to health care? Absolutely, I do, he said in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson. Not everything in the Affordable Care Act is bad. As we move forward and take a look at some of these changes and what's occurring, I think we ought to embrace what's good in the Affordable Care Act. (Politico's Burgess Everett obtained the audio of an event his staff closed to the press.)
Despite the success with Socks, the government's efforts to manage its online presence soon hit rocky shoals. Readers of a certain age will remember a period when typing whitehouse into a Web browser would append an automatic .com and take innocent Web users to a destination where no socks — or any other clothing — might be found. The domain is still not owned by the government, now offering people the opportunity to bet on politics instead of learn about it.
-- Former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas cannot attend the trial because his ankle monitor prevents him from getting through security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave Parnas tickets to the proceeding, but he won't go after a federal judge denied his request to remove his monitor. (Shayna Jacobs)
Likewise, Democratic governors can claim progress in extending Medicaid coverage or reforming fee-for-service payment in their states. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper went to bat to fight to save the Affordable Care Act; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has been front and center working on reducing the cost of prescription drugs. But Medicare-for-all? It has never come close to passing, partly because voters have no desire to give up employer-provided insurance.
Seven Democrats voted for Azar's confirmation, while one Republican, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, opposed him. Before the vote, leading GOP senators praised Azar. I can think of very few others as qualified to take the helm of this very large ship, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). With experience both on the company side and the government side of health care, he is now only more experienced and knowledgeable.
It's only thanks to the efforts of my predecessors that we get to take this step forward, Azar said.
What began as a savvy political strategy — tapping veterans as a potent constituency and seizing on bureaucratic failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs to hammer the Obama administration — has transformed CVA into one of the most muscular arms of the conservative Koch network.
OOF: A pair of Republican lawmakers took a step towar trying to force a vote on the House floor on a bill that would require medical protections for infants born alive during abortions.
[Several GOP governors voice doubt about health-care bill just released by Senate]
But conservatives consider it a top priority to block Planned Parenthood from accessing Medicaid funding and other federal grants — and they may use the repeal bill to do so. Taxpayer funding for abortions is already illegal, because of a spending restriction that has been in place since 1976. But Planned Parenthood provides a host of other health-care services for women, including cancer screenings and gynecological exams.
Trump and the Republicans see the shift — and the Democratic division — as an opportunity to portray their opponents as radical and out of touch with mainstream America. The attacks have been fueled further by actions on the part of some Democrats, including remarks from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) supporting the elimination of private insurance as part of a single-payer health-care system and a document from the office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) outlining details of the Green New Deal that her office has since disavowed.
We can't get so frustrated with Donald Trump that we impeach him just for being Donald Trump, but we can't get so frustrated with Donald Trump that we don't impeach him because he's Donald Trump. From Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), on Judiciary and the House Oversight Committee:
In a statement, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said, No American should be forced to violate his or her own conscience in order to abide by the laws and regulations governing our healthcare system.
She would be delivering this story onstage now, except that there's a pandemic and, therefore, no gigs. Or she might be telling it on TV, except that Hulu canceled her I Love You, America series in 2019 and HBO passed on her latest pilot last year. Then again, it makes cosmic sense that this is being told on her podcast, because it's hard to imagine Silverman's pot-fueled parable getting space to breathe on those other platforms. The HBO bigwigs would have told her to tighten up the anecdote. The rules of standup would have required the setup to be met by a punchline.
In the book, set to be officially released next week, Wolff writes that Trump became upset that he couldn't give a Supreme Court seat to a friend rather than someone he didn't know. He casts Trump as having little or no interest in Republican attempts to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. And Wolff says aides were incredulous over Trump's claims that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has officially entered the 2020 race:
No, said the second. That's time in your life you never get back.
Here's the tip for the CEA: There's a federal agency called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS governs all the exchanges not run by the states, and insurers have to file a notice every year that they are offering coverage on the exchanges and file their qualified health plans with CMS; they even have information on state-based exchanges. A simple phone call would turn up a list. (Kaiser Family Foundation used this CMS data to create an interactive map.)
You must while away the hours, consumin' whisky sours,
It was initially unclear if the festivities Trump alluded to would complement or compete with the existing celebration on the Mall that has been held for decades, Faiz Siddiqui reports. There also are no details on who would pay for it.
But several key lawmakers involved in the process indicated that Trump is pushing an overly ambitious timeline. Democrats took more than a year to pass the ACA and related legislation, and they had a filibuster-proof 60-vote Senate majority for much of that time.
Barr wrote that he prepared the memo because as a former attorney general, I am naturally interested in significant legal issues of public import, and I frequently offer my views on legal issues of the day — sometimes in discussions directly with public officials; sometimes in published op-eds; sometimes in amicus briefs; and sometimes in congressional testimony.
Trump allies also point to the president's unlikely victory over more polished politicians in the 2016 Republican primary and his electoral college win against Hillary Clinton as evidence of his political acumen.
So with Democrats in charge, Republicans should be in flow, controlling the field and dominating the conversation. Yet that's not what's happening at all. In fact, Republicans seem unable to find their opposition mojo.
Today, McConnell can reasonably claim he's singularly responsible for keeping the Supreme Court with a 5-4 conservative balance.
-- Attorneys assisting migrant parents have struggled to find separated children, often running up against mixed messaging from the U.S. government. Kevin Sieff reports: One legal aid organization, the Texas Civil Rights Project, is representing more than 300 parents and has been able to track down only two children. 'Either the government wasn't thinking at all about how they were going to put these families back together, or they decided they just didn't care,' said Natalia Cornelio, with the organization. Government officials say they have given detained parents a flier with a toll-free number for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the U.S. agency that is usually in charge of providing shelter for unaccompanied immigrant children. But not a single one of [attorney Jodi] Goodwin's clients had received one, she said. Lawyers maintain that when they have called the number, often no one answered. In some cases, when someone did pick up, that person refused to offer details of where children had been taken, the lawyers said.
The letter included rhetoric Trump had used at political rallies to attack Hillary Clinton, our colleague Callum Borchers writes, adding the stunning admission from the president's former physician could be a troubling sign of what's to come. What ought to worry Trump is not the shattering of his image as the 'healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency'; what should concern him is that Bornstein is suddenly saying unhelpful things in the press — and that could embolden others who feel burned by Trump to do the same.
Perhaps when citizens elect representatives we should ask ourselves what reasoning skills those candidates bring with them to the table, and what kind of outcomes they are likely to produce as a result.
The White House has had no proposal in the works, according to administration officials, but Trump wants Republicans to pass a bill that would replace President Barack Obama's signature health-care law, which Trump has repeatedly called a disaster.

-- George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, is engaged in a counternarrative to his wife's pro-Trump spin on his Twitter feed. From Karen Tumulty: George Conway mostly retweets things that others have posted, with occasional commentary. After Trump horrified fiscal conservatives by signing a $1.3 trillion spending bill, Conway twice retweeted the growing national debt total. His feed frequently includes things that are being said on television about the president's mounting legal troubles and the chaos in his White House. … Is the message that Conway is sending here aimed at his wife — or her boss? Is this his way of trying to sabotage her job — or rescue her from it?
For context, the independent prosecutor who investigated the Iran-Contra scandal took seven years to put out his final report. Lawrence Walsh found no credible evidence that Ronald Reagan had broken the law, but he argued that the former president had knowingly participated or at least acquiesced in the coverup. While Walsh also wrote that he found no evidence George H.W. Bush broke the law, he alleged that the then-vice president was fully aware of the Iran arms sales. This was essentially a moot point when he released it to the public in 1994, a year after Bush's term as president ended.

Trump agrees to moderate a debate among the Republican candidates hosted by the conservative site Newsmax and slated for the end of December.
Biden had criticized the prescribing rules as unnecessary last year and vowed to lift them if elected. But his administration instead preserved the rules last month by halting a last-minute Trump administration plan intended as a workaround, frustrating doctors and public health groups that say the rules are slowing the response to the nation's worsening opioid crisis. The administration said the Trump plan was premature, Dan Diamond reports.
The issue is whether a 2017 decision by Congress to remove Obamacare's penalty for not buying health insurance — what is called the individual mandate — meant that the requirement to purchase health insurance was itself unconstitutional. In 2012, the Supreme Court said the penalty was key to the law's constitutionality and was a legitimate use of Congress's taxing power.
It was mostly about how we're going to act in the Senate, not about anything else, said McConnell, seeking to play down the incident.

I was very pleased by the president's response, Wilson told reporters before the event, according to the newspapers. And I would have supported the prior president if he had acted, but he didn't. Where chemical weapons are used, there should be immediate action. Because if we don't, sadly it's an opportunity for chemical weapons to be used around the world and, we know, ultimately, within the United States.
I don't think most people understand the details, but they have a real sense that it would be a setback for health-care coverage in this country if the ACA were wiped out, said former congressman Henry Waxman (D-
-- Hundreds of alumni from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's high school signed a letter expressing outrage about her role in the separations. From Eli Rosenberg: The digital letter was drafted Monday after a group of alumni of Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa said they were distressed by Nielsen's vigorous defense during a combative news conference Monday of the separations of migrant families crossing illegally into the United States from Mexico. … The more than 600 signatories to the open letter include members of every class since 1978, as well as alumni from as far back as the class of 1969. It has also been signed by dozens of current students, parents and family members of alumni, and by faculty and former faculty, including a former school headmaster.
Still, that means that a minority of partisan citizens — tens of millions — do sometimes wish for political violence toward those they oppose.

The bill also mandates congressional redistricting be done by independent commissions, requires the disclosure of dark money contributions to political groups, and creates a system of public financing for congressional campaigns, among dozens of other provisions.
If they ever come to my town I'll be eagerly awaiting with my 12 gauge loaded with ball and buck, wrote one commentator, Gary Whitson.
The legislation would have expanded eligibility for insurance subsidies to people at higher incomes, eliminating the current threshold of 400 percent of the federal poverty level and saying that no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income on the most popular tier of marketplace health plans.
Marjorie Jones Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of Planned Parenthood. Everything is still in progress, she said.
Timothy Brown, known as the Berlin patient, was cured a decade ago after he received a similar stem cell transplant.
Trump's top health officials have largely adopted that line – that they're making the best of a bad law. Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, often points to several types of newly-expanded leaner, cheaper health plans as evidence that her agency is expanding options for Americans and giving them greater flexibility in how they get covered.
This pattern repeated itself at a new level around the 2020 election. Stop the Steal narratives about widespread fraud, albeit without evidence, sought to undermine the results. Bloggers and certain friendly radio and TV shows didn't need to worry about providing defensible facts or being confronted with the truth. Soon, President Donald Trump was talking about how the election could be overturned and awarded to the true winner — him — if only a secretary of state . . . or a governor . . . or the judges he appointed . . . or congressional Republicans . . . or the vice president would fight like he wanted them to. It was ultimately all political posturing, and I honestly don't know if the president believed the story or not — but many in the GOP base did. Two-thirds of voters who are Republican or lean Republican have been misled into thinking that there is solid evidence of widespread fraud in the election, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found this month.
Underwood and Hill are Exhibits A and B of the political potency of the health-care debate for Republicans, examples of why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) are so reluctant to follow Trump's call to make the GOP the party of health care.
-- When acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made a similar argument in the fall, essentially saying that presidents do quid pro quos all the time, he quickly walked it back. Mulvaney hasn't been back to the briefing room since then. He refused to comply with a subsequent subpoena, citing an order from Trump, one of the grounds for the second article of impeachment pertaining to obstruction of Congress.
If we don't call out racism, certainly at the highest levels of power, in this position of trust that the president enjoys, then we are going to continue to get its consequences, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke told reporters last week after an Iowa town hall meeting in which he compared Trump's rhetoric to Nazi Germany.
Barnett realized he had misread the Federalist Society. Despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. He switched from contracts to constitutional law. He made himself an expert on the Ninth Amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in California, where the state had legalized it. The case ended up relying not on the Ninth Amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite Federalist tool for curbing federal power. Barnett argued the matter before the Supreme Court in 2004. He lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.
As The Washington Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson wrote, figuring out exactly how many people would die if access to health care is taken away is not an easy estimate to reach. Johnson wrote:
Sanders's dedication to his program appeals to those seeking absolutes in politics. Sanders supporters all over Iowa and New Hampshire said they like that he has not changed in decades. He is incapable of telling anything but the truth, said Mohammed Ziny, a New Hampshire Sanders field organizer, on Sunday.

The new guidance — which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explained in a letter sent yesterday to every state Medicaid director — is a groundbreaking new policy that holds the potential to transform the Medicaid program, CMS Administrator Seema Verma told an invited crowd of health-care stakeholders at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington.
Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Tx.), the resolution's sponsor:
A spokeswoman for Wilson said that too much emphasis has been placed on one moment at the town hall.
Trump's threat to close the border was made in the tradition of leaders who seek to stir up populist emotions in the electorate without thinking through the consequences of their proposals, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University professor who studies authoritarian rulers.
The Democrats who have followed her path have more carefully crafted their lines. Here's a guide to the rhetoric, from the worst to least-inaccurate. As this is a roundup, we're not awarding Pinocchios. But no one would earn any Geppettos.
Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said of his party's shift to the left: It makes it more difficult in more-rural areas like mine. Absolutely makes it more difficult.
The Violence Against Women Act was first passed in 1994 — just after Barr ended his first term as attorney general under former president George H.W. Bush. He pledged to familiarize myself with the office, its work and its programs, and strongly support that.
Andrew Yang: … Nonprofits, religious organizations, arts and culture. It goes towards the things that actually make that community function in a healthy way. And it may not be that the hardware store reopens, but you wind up with things like yoga studios and learning centers and things that don't necessarily easily disappear to the cloud. This is one reason why I want to try and repurpose many of the stores and malls that are now closing, because when retail districts close or, in particular, when a mall closes, it causes urban blight for blocks and blocks around. So we have to do our best to try and shift many of these structures to some new productive use that will look different than the use that came before. But if we fail in this, then these communities will likely never recover.
Stay home, try not to roam, observe the quarantine,
Hanger has supported expansion for years but objected to aspects of the original House plan. Wagner recently said he was open to expansion in some form.
A countywide state of emergency was declared in Rockland County, starting a ban that will last 30 days or until unvaccinated children get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Until then, unvaccinated minors will be prohibited from being in churches, schools, shopping centers and other public spaces, though the ban does not included outdoor areas like playgrounds.
Right. But he could afford it, he finally got it under Obama, Valde told Cruz.
Also hard to imagine is the wider political appeal of Medicare-for-all-except-a-little-more-for-unions.
-- The legislation has certainly helped galvanize Democratic energy. Melissa Holloway, 32, is a registered nurse who works with Medicaid recipients. The Democrat wore a Not My President T-shirt as she joined two dozen friends for an impromptu protest outside Price's rally for Handel. I believe health care is a human right, she said. Most of the people who are going to be hurt by Trumpcare are already disadvantaged. … That's what real terrorism looks like.
OPERATOR: Thank you. And we'll go next to Sara Murray from CNN.
In recent days, Obama has even weighed in with a warning to his party about the immigration issue. During an April 6 town hall in Germany, he implored his audience to have more empathy for those who worry that increased immigration will weaken their communities.
Ultimately, people decide who is best to represent all of us, he said. I'm going to fight hard as I always have to make sure we address issues that are important to women, families, all of us.
Quinnipiac University also took a run at this question in March. It asked, If Congress decides to repeal Obamacare, do you think that Congress should repeal Obamacare as soon as possible even if they have not decided on a plan to replace it, or should they wait to repeal Obamacare until they have a plan to replace it?
Cheryl Fish-Parcham, of the advocacy organization Families USA, said the data reflects the need to shore up the marketplaces. We need to make sure there is policy that is conducive to keeping carriers in the marketplace and making sure consumers have great choices, she said.
Through nursery school, kindergarten, T-ball, soccer, volleyball and her passion for ballet . . . Hillary first and foremost was a mother, he said in his speech.
That is a horrible, worsening vulnerability for this president, Dobbs said. A glaring electoral burden facing 2020.
2 p.m.: Barr says Trump 'absolutely' did not ask him to interfere in Mueller investigation
-- In the shadow of the recent attack, Brexit negotiations got underway between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Michael Birnbaum reports: Discussions began with an immediate concession from the British over how the talks will be structured, a display of the weakness of the British position in the face of an unusual degree of unity among the E.U.'s 27 remaining members … Despite sharp splits in London over what to seek in the divorce, the lead British negotiator vowed that his nation would plunge onward with a full declaration of independence, dampening expectations after the election that Britain would move to preserve some ties with Brussels … European leaders have repeatedly said that Britain need not go through with its plans for divorce — although they have been tough about what a split will mean if it happens.
Their concern is basically this: Withholding the CSR payments (which compensate insurers for extra cost-sharing discounts they give the lowest-income consumers) had the counterintuitive effect of making bronze- and gold-level plans more affordable for subsidized shoppers (we explained this here). Start paying the subsidies, and plans could actually become less affordable for these consumers. Without the requirement to buy coverage, some low-income Americans might decide to drop coverage altogether.
Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.
So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges. They'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, they'll go to Wharton, as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out. They want to stay in this country. They want to stay here desperately, they're not able to stay here. For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.
Government attorneys have also filed requests for extra time on pending cases.
10:20 a.m.: Graham digs into accusations of Justice Department bias
Then switch to still color photo, face shot only, of a smiling Republican congressman as the announcer intones: Actually, it was your senator, Bob Corker, who voted for that tax plan when he voted to repeal Obamacare and kick millions of poor, sick and disabled Americans off of health insurance. Is that the government you thought you were voting for? Is that the kind of America you want to live in? 
The White House official argued that this move had bolstered the stability of the market: Many health reform experts have noted that the ACA exchanges are becoming more stable as insurers have significantly raised premiums on people who are largely insensitive to the premium spikes because of the tax credit structure, and as many markets only have one or two insurers and thus little, if any, competition.
GOP lawmakers of all ideological stripes said that Trump needs to take a more aggressive role in refereeing the intraparty disputes.
Only the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.
Loyal readers of Krugman's twice-weekly column in the New York Times will not be surprised by the central themes of the book, which includes and expands on his Times writings. He forcefully and repeatedly contends that Republican lawmakers are carrying water for corporations and the wealthiest Americans by rolling back regulations and cutting taxes for the rich on the basis of the fake or zombie theory that what's good for the 1 percent is good for everybody. (In Krugman's vivid language, zombie ideas are those that should have been killed by contrary evidence, but instead keep shambling along, eating people's brains.)
Week 1376, add a character to a Shakespeare play:
That means we can judge whether the president, whom we've dubbed the king of flip-flops, is making yet another flip-flop on an important policy issue. Let's explore what the president has said about the preexisting conditions section in Obamacare, which public-opinion polling shows is one of the most popular features of the law.
The boycott storyline. As The Trailer pointed out on Sunday, MoveOn's admonition for Democrats to skip the conference was mostly PR. Presidential candidates do not typically address AIPAC in off years; the group did not invite them to speak this year. And only Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued a statement, through his campaign, saying that he had a reason not to visit. (He's concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution, Sanders policy director Josh Orton said,)
President Trump has repeatedly said a novel coronavirus vaccine will be created in record time. Experts say it won't be ready for at least a year. (The Washington Post)
In the aftermath of an unprecedented year of grief, fear and unrest, America is hurting. Our society has been torn apart; trust has eroded. It feels as if so many of our common connections have broken.
-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, needs to study economics before offering her thoughts on climate change. Heather Long reports from Davos: Thunberg and Mnuchin are both attending the World Economic Forum this week. … At a news conference on Thursday, Mnuchin was asked for his reaction to Thunberg's insistence on fossil fuel divestment. 'Who is she?' he tried to joke to reporters before taking a jab at Thunberg, suggesting she didn't understand what she was talking about. … 'Is she the chief economist or who is she? I'm confused. ... After she goes and studies economics in college she can go back and explain that to us.'
Photographer Nan Goldin started the anti-opioid group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now after she became addicted to OxyContin, and the group has been staging demonstrations at museums and calling on arts institutions to take down the Sackler name and denounce the family and its gifts. But officials at the Smithsonian, for one, said the gift agreement with Arthur Sackler included naming rights in perpetuity and that they had no plans to remove the name or return the donated money or art.
Here's everything you need to know about reconciliation.
It was actually my suggestion that they come up with a list and that they consult with the Federalist Society, which they did, said McConnell, who added: Gorsuch was on the list.
The biggest issue has been the CDC's struggles with testing: Numerous problems with the Trump administration's testing regimen have come to light: Coronavirus tests developed by CDC were flawed, possibly because the lab itself was contaminated, Politico reports. The resulting lack of test capacity forced U.S. officials to screen a limited number of patients in January and February, with the CDC testing fewer than 500 Americans at the same time that China was likely testing at least 1 million of its own residents.
A quick review: The agreement hammered out between Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, the top Republican and Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, faltered under partisan disputes this year. Democrats refused to add funding for the subsidies (which reimbursed marketplace insurers for cost-sharing discounts) into spending bills, incensed that Republicans had punched holes in the Affordable Care Act instead of trying to improve the law and then tried to add antiabortion language to the originally bipartisan agreement.
-- Channeling Clarence Thomas, Fairfax declared in extended remarks before the state Senate yesterday that he is the victim of political lynchings: If we go backwards and we rush to judgment, and we allow for political lynchings without any due process, any facts, any evidence being heard, then I think we do a disservice to this very body in which we all serve, he said. Senators of both parties reacted with silence.
But most of those extra jobs are part time, not full time. And as we noted, the millions of people amount to just 5 percent of Americans with jobs. So that means 95 percent are not working two or three jobs just to survive. The percentage has been roughly steady since the Great Recession, and in fact is lower than in the mid-1990s, when it hovered around 6 percent.
CRUZ: Yes, their choice is very clear. If you look to the actual record -- you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats. But that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing.
Verma said the agency is determined to make sure Medicaid remains the safety net for those that need it most. To that end, we have determined we will not approve Kansas' recent request to place a lifetime limit on Medicaid benefits, Verma said as part of her speech to the AHA. We seek to create a pathway out of poverty, but we also understand that people's circumstances change, and we must ensure that our programs are sustainable and available to them when they need and qualify for them.
And, one reason why the total projection is so large is because the Trump administration ordered hundreds of millions of vaccine doses last year, before any of the vaccines were approved, partly as a way to encourage vaccine development – and to hedge bets about which would be delivered first.
Once a country reaches 100 cases, the number of cases appears to increase 33 percent a day. The United States reached the threshold a little later than some European countries but appears to be following the same trajectory. Moreover, inadequate testing appears to be obscuring the number of cases in the United States.
Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) wanted to know why drug companies' stocks went up after Trump announced his proposal. She suggested it was difficult to believe that Azar, who headed Lilly USA, the largest affiliate of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, before being tapped to run HHS, was in good faith pushing for a bill to lower prices.
Deporting all 11 million immigrants in the country illegally? Trump is fuzzy on whether he stands on one of his signature his campaign promises, but Ryan indicated Thursday he's inclined to help keep children of undocumented parents in the country. No, he said when asked by an undocumented woman whether he thinks she should be deported.
I was so afraid of making a misstep or breaking something or getting into an accident — just these sudden things that happen and suddenly your life is ruined, said Powers, 62.
The number of people without health insurance rose to more than 27 million people in 2018, or about 8.5 percent of the country, the Census Bureau reported last fall, the latest figures available. Health-care experts attributed the rise — the first annual increase since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 — to the Trump administration's efforts to undermine President Barack Obama's signature health law. Under Trump, individuals are no longer required to have coverage, and insurers are allowed to sell cheaper plans that cover fewer medical services and don't offer protections for people with preexisting conditions.
The gesture is all the more stunning because Northam ran on the promise that he would expand Medicaid to about 400,000 uninsured Virginians. It's his top priority in the legislative session that ends Saturday. And it will be the first big test of his young governorship, in a fight that could crescendo amid budget negotiations this week.
Not a day goes by without President Trump bashing the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, as he tries to urge the Senate to pass its own version of a repeal-and-replace bill. He's become a torrent of statistics as he has tried to make the case that the law is dead, as he puts it.
Shalala: Medicare has never been associated with welfare, with poor people. Medicaid has, that's number one. Number two: We're at the Capitol. We're at the federal government. That's a Medicare program, not a Medicaid program. Just a handful of experts on Medicaid are in Congress and most of them have retired.
The sharpest increase in hospitalization and emergency room treatment for opioids was among people ages 25 to 44.... The data also show that women are now as likely as men to be admitted to a hospital for inpatient treatment for opioid-related problems, Joel and Dan write.
Where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax cut? she asked.
NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:
Many states have such outdated technology — which also rely on decades-old software — that their systems have struggled to make unemployment aid available for gig workers and self-employed workers who don't normally qualify for money but were made eligible by the new law.
-- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) canceled a campaign fundraiser in D.C. in light of the Iran developments. Klobuchar said she was closely monitoring what is happening in Iraq and backed out of the event that was to be held at the home of a former Yale classmate. (Washington Examiner)
The ongoing debate highlights the party's struggle to devise a health-care plan that can satisfy a broad swath of lawmakers.
Should Kavanaugh shy away from reviewing the Indiana laws, it would certainly be a huge disappointment to abortion foes. President Trump's promise to appoint judges opposing abortion rights was a key reason many voters backed him for president, even as he came under fire for derogatory remarks against women.
The pharmaceutical industry opposes the bill, and some Republicans have derided the legislation as tantamount to negotiating drug prices or imposing price controls — a line in the sand for many who oppose what they see as government interference in the market. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not said whether he will bring a drug-pricing legislative package up for a vote, but he is generally opposed to voting on health-care legislation ahead of the election.
Furthermore, the proposed spending reductions will almost certainly not become law because Congress — including the Democratic-led House — would have to approve them.
As both he and Romney flirt with 2016 runs, Trump slams Romney in Iowa.
Both candidates support a $15-an-hour minimum wage, but Perriello has also called for universal pre-K and eight weeks of guaranteed leave for workers at two-thirds pay to care for a new child or a sick family member.
In addition, one of the issues that's come up quite a bit is his record on civil rights. I think his record is extremely strong. While Senator Sessions was U.S. attorney, he signed onto a host of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama. As senator, he voted in favor of the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act and has spearheaded efforts to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, an Alabama native and civil rights icon.

The fact sheet also seeks to rebut Trump on a recurring criticism of McCain: that he voted in dramatic fashion against a Republican bill in 2017 seeking to gut the Affordable Care Act.
In an announcement yesterday at the American Medical Association, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top health officials said more than one-fourth of seniors in the traditional Medicare program – nearly 11 million people – could be affected by the five-year experiment.

The sign-ups occurred during the first two weeks of an extended enrollment period ordered by Biden.
But the program could be in limbo amid political maneuvering during the shutdown. If the program is being used as a pawn in a broader political effort, that may be why they're not answering questions about the basic numbers, Kevin Concannon, a former Agriculture Department undersecretary for nutrition under President Barack Obama, told Helena. They should be clear on that.
We've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.
I've long been open to changing the Senate rules to restore the standing filibuster. If a senator insists on blocking the will of the Senate, he should at least pay the minimal price of being present, no more phoning it in, said Durbin.
-- Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are talking a lot about civil rights, but not many black voters are listening. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports from South Carolina and Annie Linskey reports from Alabama: They share a liberal philosophy focused on helping those who've been hurt by the prevailing system, a message both say should resonate in black households. But both are older white candidates hailing from New England, and they often confront skepticism — if not ambivalence or indifference — from black voters, who have been notably absent from their campaign events. … A month before Sanders spoke at Royal Missionary Baptist Church, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) held a rally in the same room. Her crowd was much more racially varied, including a group of black women who showed up in church hats. The crowds showing up for Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also have included far more voters of color.
Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) tweeted that the agreement touted by Republicans would be released without Democrats on board.
Why do it? Because Trump understands something very important: For his supporters, the media represent everything they dislike about American society. The media is composed, to their mind, of Ivy-League-educated coastal elites who look down their noses at the average person, dismissing them and their views as stupid and ill-informed. For people who feel like their voices weren't and aren't heard in politics — or culture more broadly — the media is the perfect scapegoat.
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
Eighty-four thousand Americans have now applied to serve in the administration and 220,000 Americans have shared their ideas for making America great.
Many candidates and officeholders release full, unredacted versions of their tax returns for public consumption, so there's a big difference between what Bloomberg did and the norm. Trump, meanwhile, has declined to release his tax returns or divest from his company.
The group that brought Warmbier to North Korea announced that it will no longer allow Americans to travel on its tours, USA Today's Melanie Eversley reports.
CNN notes that governors will air this at a meeting with Trump today. By the way, a lot of GOP senators represent states that have expanded Medicaid, so keep an eye on them.
After the town hall Friday, Labrador said on his Facebook page, It was my privilege to spend two hours today in Lewiston fielding questions from my constituents, many of them about our efforts to provide quality health care to all Americans at an affordable and sustainable cost.
Meanwhile, McConnell has his eye on a couple of possible pickups among the dozen seats Democrats are defending. In ruby-red Alabama, Democrat Doug Jones is clinging by his fingernails to the seat he won after Jeff Sessions left the Senate to serve, unhappily, as Trump's attorney general. Now Sessions wants the seat back, and he will be harder to beat than Jones's previous opponent, creepy Roy Moore.
And Mexico will pay for the wall.
We get to a general election for the highest office in this land, and no presidential candidate comes to Alabama or to Mississippi, Warren told a crowd of 500 at a rally last night in Birmingham, Ala. Your vote just doesn't count ... and that is wrong.

Over the past year, it has hired a top law firm to defend against the lawsuit, and cultivated formidable allies with close ties to President Trump, including GOP operative Roger Stone and Newsmax chief executive Christopher Ruddy. Kristin Comella, the company's chief scientific officer, said she met late last year with a White House official, whom she declined to identify, to press the administration to get the FDA to back off. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In a long interview at her company's main clinic in Weston, Fla., an hour north of Miami, Comella accused the FDA of overstepping its authority — which, she said, does not extend to any of her treatments. She said that adverse events are rare, and that doctors trained by U.S. Stem Cell have provided relief to more than 10,000 people, many of them suffering from in­trac­table conditions.
Part of Democrats' confidence here comes from the idea that the Supreme Court would eventually swat the lawsuit down. (The last attempt to kill the ACA on a technicality lost at the high court by a 6-3 margin, with John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy joining the court's liberals.) In their nightmare scenario, where a conservative majority shredded the ACA, Republicans would get a period to gloat about destroying Barack Obama's legacy; Democrats would get an election about health care, with the estimated 19 million customers affected by a potential end to Obamacare suddenly thrown into the void.
The president gets many things wrong in this pair of tweets. Puerto Rico so far has only received over $11 billion out of nearly $41 billion in funds that have been appropriated. As we have detailed before, Trump's $91 billion figure includes $50 billion in additional estimated liabilities that could emerge over the next 20 years, but that's a figure subject to change. Trump suggests that the money has already been received but that's simply wrong. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, Puerto Rico will have received about $21 billion.
The president and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the growing defense ties between the world's two largest democracies even as they acknowledged that a trade deal between them remains distant. During his second day in India, Trump is holding formal meetings with the Indian leadership, making a visit to the U.S. Embassy and attending a state banquet in New Delhi, Joanna Slater reports. Trump began Tuesday by participating in a grand ceremonial welcome and visiting a memorial to Mohandas Gandhi … There will be no huge crowds or tourism for the president today.
But many health policy and legal experts disagree and are also skeptical that the steps the administration is talking about would have a tangible effect on consumers before the election.
The attorney general nominee continued to speak about gun policy under questioning from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). Barr said while the right to own a gun is protected under the Second Amendment, there's room for reasonable regulation on firearms laws.
Although far outside the box, the effort is not easily dismissed, Isaac and Michael wrote. Rival campaigns worry about the creeping possibility that he finds a way to catch fire if the early states deliver no clear front-runner, or that he wins enough delegates to deny anyone a majority, granting him a brokering role in choosing the nominee before the convention.
The SBA has rapidly run out of money as businesses clamor for funds. The initial bill approved by Congress included about $349 billion in loans for the small business program, but within days it became clear the money would not last long, and the administration has already asked for an additional $250 billion.
If it was up to me we'd just dust off the 2015 repeal and add some of what Rand Paul's been talking about, Adam Brandon, the president of the low-tax advocacy group FreedomWorks, said in an interview. But it seems like that ship has sailed.
To Trump's backers here in northern Kentucky — the small cities, affluent suburbs and rolling hill country that fans out just across the muddy Ohio River from Cincinnati — that is just how they like it. Many have long been wary of McConnell, deeming him overly willing to cut a deal and insufficiently committed to the president's agenda. His management of the president's trial, they say, will be a test.
Northam and Perriello will debate Saturday at 6 p.m. at Lanier Middle School in Fairfax.
[New push to repeal Obamacare ignites old GOP tensions]
In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.
TRUMP: They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
House GOP may target Obamacare. Politico's Rachael Bade and Jennifer Haberkorn: House GOP leaders may load up a temporary government funding bill with Obamacare tax delays in a bid to win over reluctant Republicans and avoid a shutdown at week's end. Speaker Paul Ryan and his team will huddle with rank-and-file GOP lawmakers in what's expected to be a contentious conference meeting Tuesday night. Senior Republican sources say GOP leaders will float several options to try to secure Republicans votes on what will be the fourth spending stopgap since September — an embarrassing practice that Republicans say puts the military at risk.
In less safe districts where a shutdown might be more unpopular than Obamacare, Republicans highlighted their efforts to resolve the impasse.
First in The Health 202: The pro-ACA group Save My Care will concurrently run an ad urging Azar to reject Idaho's recent move to allow health insurers to sell plans that aren't compliant with Obamacare regulations. The state has issued a bulletin saying plans could decide not to cover benefits the Affordable Care Act mandates or could choose to put lifetime caps on benefits (also banned under the ACA).
There was a bright spot for taxpayers last week, when the White House directed the IRS to issue tax refunds even as the shutdown continued. And my Washington Post colleagues reported yesterday that a bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators is holding discussions on how to end the shutdown — even though there's no guarantee that will work.
Create jobs and opportunities for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. (Both unemployment rates hit record lows under Trump, as the overall unemployment rate also sank to a historic lows, although all have risen amid the coronavirus pandemic. What's more, the trends for each largely continued their trajectory from before the pandemic.)
Shalala: I would love to have the mandate back. But I wouldn't put the mandate back without doing some of these other things to make [insurance] more affordable and more attractive and easier. But I do think whatever we do, our goal ought to be universal coverage — affordable, high-quality universal coverage.
Working-class people understand in a very personal way that Trump really doesn't care about them (the shutdown standoff has also poked holes in Trump's ability to say he cares for the working class, given that 800,000 federal employees and an additional number of contractors are going without paychecks.).
The companies that declined said they would be very happy to have discussions in private but not in public, Grassley said. That is not what I mean when I talk about transparency.
Late-term abortions are permitted in Virginia only when the mother's life is at grave risk, Gregory and Laura write. Tran's bill would have lifted some restrictions. Instead of requiring three doctors to sign off on the procedure, it would have required only one doctor. It also would have removed language requiring that the danger to the mother be 'substantial and irremediable.'
The 177-year-old company denied the charges, saying it could have shown the DEA it had done nothing wrong but was denied the chance. The company also said it has voluntarily rejected 142 pharmacies in recent years to avoid improper distribution of opioids — a number that amounted to an 8 percent reduction of Morris & Dickson's customer base.
For instance, Trump had all 12 of the states where at least 30 percent of the population has a preexisting condition in his column. Those include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia — where 36 percent of the population has a preexisting condition, more than any other state in the country.
The latest polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, released Friday morning, shows that Medi­caid expansion enjoys strong public support. Nationally, 84 percent of respondents — and 87 percent in the 16 expansion states with GOP governors — said it is important to preserve the greater federal funding provided by the ACA.
By specifically mentioning tax credits, Trump appeared to side with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) in a key intraparty debate over what the ACA's replacement ought to look like. Influential conservatives in the House and Senate have balked at offering refundable tax credits to help Americans buy insurance, advocating instead for a less expensive tax deduction.
Only a handful of members of Congress have responded positively to the president's demands. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), known for his friendship with Trump, issued a release yesterday saying Obamacare cannot be fixed…it must be replaced. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has told reporters he's working on a replacement plan.

The department has dispatched teams of undercover officers, known as 'rakers,' into minority neighborhoods as part of a human mapping program, according to a Pulitzer Prize-winning series from the Associated Press. They've monitored daily life in bookstores, bars, cafes and nightclubs. Police have also used informants, known as 'mosque crawlers,' to monitor sermons, even when there's no evidence of wrongdoing. NYPD officials have scrutinized imams and gathered intelligence on cabdrivers and food cart vendors, jobs often done by Muslims.
But politics, not Senate rules, might be the more significant obstacle to a comprehensive Obamacare repeal. One unanswered question is whether the repeal bill will include a key provision of the 2015 bill: the defunding of Planned Parenthood.
WALLACE: No, you're not, sir. Let's put up full screen number 2.
The whole purpose of this report is to make sure that the bill complies with a requirement — given by Congress to Congress — to reduce the federal deficit by $2 billion over the next decade. That's because Republicans are attempting to get this bill through Congress without any Democratic votes, so they have to use a budgetary rule that allows them to avoid a Senate Democratic filibuster. If the math whizzes at the CBO calculate that the House bill falls short of that goal, the bill can't move on to the Senate, and House Republicans will have to start over.
In states with large senior populations, such as Florida, political attacks over Medicare cuts have proved so effective that both parties have used them. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) won his seat after running ads last year accusing Democrat Bill Nelson of voting to cut Medicare.
Ed O'Keefe, Sean Sullivan and Dave Weigel contributed to this report.
-- Phil Mudd, who held senior jobs at the FBI and CIA, said the president should be much more worried than he appears to be about what Mueller told his lawyers. If someone walked into my office and said I was the subject of a multi-year criminal investigation led by [Mueller], I'd wet my pants, he said on CNN last night in response to The Washington Post's story.
In their call he praised Duterte for doing an unbelievable job on the drug problem. … Many countries have the problem, we have the problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that, Trump said, according to the transcript.
It would [seem] that the 'Russia hacking' story was concocted not just to explain away an embarrassing election defeat, but to cover up the real scandal, wrote Breitbart's senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak.
But each Democrat has described the goal differently. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in his weekend stops across Iowa that he backed a Medicare-for-all option, describing a government program into which people could buy while leaving private insurance in place.
— FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency approved or tentatively approved more than 2,000 generic drugs from 2017 through 2018, with a record of 128 approved in both October and November.
The fact that we got out of there unscathed is nothing short of a miracle, said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).
Harris's suggestion that the United States should move on from private health insurance, drew attention to the fact that the Medicare-for-all plans backed by 16 senators — including five potential candidates for the Democratic nomination — would in effect remove private health insurance from the estimated 251 million Americans who use it, broadly disrupting the industry and the way Americans experience the medical system, our Post colleague Annie Linskey reports.
Treasury headed into the crisis with vacancies in more than half a dozen senior positions, some of whom would otherwise be playing key roles in processing the work, according to critics of the administration. Mnuchin does not have a chief of staff, for instance, or an undersecretary for domestic finance, a role responsible for monitoring large changes in the U.S. economy.

TRUMP: He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn't vote. He doesn't show up for the U.S. Senate. He doesn't vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida.
Even when Trump was unable to change the status quo (e.g., repealing the Affordable Care Act), his fans could rationalize that the fault lay with others. When he didn't do what he promised (pass a tax cut wholly directed at the middle class) and instead favored his cronies and rich friends, they could be mollified with the promise of higher wages and more jobs for everyone.
Children are hereby permitted to return to their respective schools forthwith and otherwise to assemble in public places, Judge Rolf Thorsen wrote in his decision, as our colleague Frances Stead Sellers reports.
British security officials said the Westminster Bridge attacker sent an encrypted WhatsApp message just minutes before carrying out his deadly attack — prompting a contentious debate surrounding privacy rights on the Facebook-owned messaging service. Authorities pleaded with organizations that provide encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police.

Stephen Colbert offered an early valentine to Schiff during his show. It was gratifying to see someone taking the constitutional responsibility of their office seriously, the comedian told his viewers on CBS.

Bloomberg's ad, which your Virginia-dwelling Health 202 author spotted at least three times during the Golden Globe Awards, touts improvements in insurance coverage, life expectancy and infant mortality during his tenure as mayor. It also contrasts his support for the Affordable Care Act with President Trump's attempts to dismantle it.
As evangelicalism has grown without any formal hierarchy, it has formed tribes often driven by celebrity pastors, authors and artists.

-- Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.), the winner of one of 2018's closest congressional races, announced he would not seek reelection next year. Felicia Sonmez reports: 'I make this announcement as early as possible to ensure that quality conservative candidates have time to prepare for a vigorous campaign in 2020,' he [said in a statement]. Woodall was first elected in 2010 and initially won his reelection campaigns by comfortable margins; in 2016, he won by more than 20 percentage points, while [Trump] won the district by a little over six points. As the district has grown more diverse, it has trended more Democratic. In 2018, Woodall beat his Democratic opponent, Carolyn Bourdeaux, by roughly 400 votes.
Those episodes have a deep psychological hold on Democrats right now, reminding everyone that being too restrained and too afraid of Republicans is a recipe for failure. While there are lots of Obama veterans in the Biden administration and lots of people outside it with deep respect and affection for the former president, those years are full of cautionary tales.

Some of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially Amy Coney Barrett, named by Trump to the 7th Circuit. More than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gaffe of telling the Catholic Barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. The lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of Barrett moderating the panel. Judge, welcome back to Washington — and I hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at Williams & Connolly, said to Barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.
Third, by laying low, Trump has avoided major gaffes and made the past two weeks about the RNC's delegate selection system. Cruz needs to turn the spotlight back on Trump. He can challenge Trump to a debate (even Hillary Clinton gave Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) one more face-off) and pressur him to spell out and defend his bizarre policy ideas. Cruz should revive the Cruz-Fiorina duo and step up the attacks on Trump's treatment of women, association with sleazy characters and his refusal to turn over his tax returns. Trump again and again has shown he can dish it out but not take it; Cruz should get back on offense.
Don Jr.'s op-ed raised a lot of eyebrows:

-- In D.C., much of Monday will be quiet and chilly before a siege of snow and wintry mix tonight. Here's the latest Capital Weather Gang forecast: Today we brace for a major late-winter storm set to begin this evening and continue into Tuesday. Depending on where you live, moderate to heavy amounts of snow could fall or a sloppy mix of snow, sleet and rain. The heaviest snowfall is expected to occur in our far western and northern areas, but the storm will likely will prove disruptive for much of the region through at least Tuesday morning. We want to stress that this forecast is extremely complex and we have lower confidence in predicted snow amounts than usual. This is especially true along and east of the Interstate 95 corridor where we have reduced our predicted snowfall amounts some. Starting Wednesday, in the wake of the storm, the region is locked into a winterlike regime with colder-than-normal temperatures through the weekend.
More immediately, McConnell's work on the courts could help bolster his party in a tough midterm election.
The Centers for Disease Control found that wearing a cloth mask over a disposable surgical mask or knotting the ear loops on a surgical mask reduced exposure to potentially infectious aerosols by more than 95 percent.
Others feel it's important to intervene in the interim given the likelihood that hundreds of thousands of customers may have only one plan option next year. And while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is prodding his conference toward passing a partial replacement, whether final legislation will ever make it to Trump's desk is still very much in doubt.
— Dozens of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to party leaders calling on them to make the opioid crisis a key agenda item in the new Congress.
We understand putting together this program is incredibly important, said Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), one of the lead advocates for the program in the House, in an interview. We have learned a lot with the [stimulus checks], and it's important we continue to engage with and use what we learned there on engaging with non-filers.
So what are the prospects for lifting it now?
We are at a place in the individual market where any increase at all creates stress in the marketplace, Maryland's health insurance commissioner Alfred Redmer Jr. said. CareFirst chief executive Chet Burrell told Carolyn insurers all over are struggling with an expensive marketplace population. We have had major, major losses, and the reason for that is the rates — as high as they have been and as steeply as they have increased — have simply not kept up with how costly it is to take care of the population, Burrell said. We're not alone in this experience.
The CBO did estimate that premiums overall will begin to drop by 2020 -- as much as 20 percent lower by 2026 for states that opt out of key pieces of Obamacare. But insurance policies are cheaper because, on average, they would provide less benefits, the report said.
Booker said he would prioritize the reinstatement of DACA, the program designed to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children.
-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put this issue on the front-burner when she announced during a televised town hall on CNN Monday night that she wants to replace the system we've used to elect presidents since 1789. Her answer was clearly rehearsed, and she used a question about voting rights for the formerly incarcerated to call for the abolition of the electoral college. She's made it a central theme of a three-day swing through the South.
-- Human-trafficking groups refuse to attend Ivanka Trump's White House summit. Jessica Contrera reports: Their decision comes after months of anguish over what they describe as an act of public deception. They say that although the president frequently invokes human trafficking, his administration is actively endangering a significant portion of trafficking victims: immigrants. 'We have such a chasm between rhetoric and reality,' said Martina Vandenberg, the founder of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, a network of attorneys who take on trafficking cases. 'This administration is undermining protections carefully built for trafficking victims over two decades.' The advocates are especially alarmed by increased scrutiny of T visas, which provide temporary legal status for immigrants who can prove they were trafficked while in the United States. At least eight organizations declined invitations to the summit because of their opposition to the administration's policies.
The message is progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go, Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the cancer society told Laurie.

-- Klobuchar has faced less media scrutiny over the past several months than anyone else in the top tier. That will change quickly if she performs well in Iowa. The Associated Press offers a taste of what's to come: She often talks about her role prosecuting the case stemming from a little girl who was struck by a stray bullet, which ended with the imprisonment of black teenager Myon Burrell. But the wire service uncovered new evidence and multiple inconsistencies in the police investigation: With no gun, no DNA, no fingerprints, the case against Burrell revolved around a teen rival who gave conflicting accounts of the shooting. Later, police turned to jailhouse informants, some of whom say they were coached and have since recanted. Alibis were not questioned. Key evidence has gone missing or was never obtained, including a convenience store surveillance tape that Burrell and others say would have cleared him. And the chief homicide detective was caught on camera offering cash for information -- even if it was just hearsay. Burrell, now 33, has maintained his innocence. Klobuchar's campaign defended her decision-making.
— In a win for Planned Parenthood, the Supreme Court rejected a request from antiabortion activists to block a lawsuit brought against them by the women's health care and abortion provider.
It's a whirlwind of activity taking place away from the spotlight that highlights how the twin crises of a viral outbreak and an economic slowdown have not slowed Trump's aggressive push to advance his broader agenda in the months before he faces voters.
Only one fourth of the courts' 400 judges were deemed essential, all of whom have dockets with detained individuals. This accounts for only 5 to 10 percent of all immigration cases.

Trump did not close the border with Europe. Only two days earlier, he announced a bar on the entry of foreign nationals who have been to any of the 26 countries in the Schengen area, the European Union's border-free travel zone — which does not include Britain, the Republic of Ireland and 21 other European countries. It did not take effect until midnight on the day of this news conference. On March 14, Trump extended the travel restrictions to the Britain and Ireland.
The American people need to know that their government is there for them in their time of great need, they said in a statement.
That he's a victim of the terrible, nasty media and the Democratic effort to take him out. That he's a genius who we are lucky — blessed! — to have as president. It's enough to make anyone want to tweet their appreciation.
By just about every metric, Trump inherited a thriving economy that was doing far better than he claimed on the campaign trail. He frequently said the unemployment rate was 42 percent, when it was actually 5 percent — a number he embraced once he took the oath of office.
-- The ranks of scientists are growing thin in the Trump administration. Annie Gowen, Juliet Eilperin, Ben Guarino and Andrew Ba Tran report: Dozens of government computers sit in a nondescript building [in Kansas City, Mo.], able to connect to a data model that could help farmers manage the impact of a changing climate on their crops. But no one in this federal agency would know how to access the model, or, if they did, what to do with the data. That's because the ambitious federal researcher who created it in Washington quit rather than move when the Agriculture Department relocated his agency to an office park here last fall. He is one of hundreds of scientists across the federal government who have been forced out, sidelined or muted since President Trump took office. … In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left government, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data … That represents a 1.5 percent drop, compared with the 8 percent increase during the same period in the Obama administration.
(BELL RINGING) TRUMP: But, many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well, and made a lot of money...
It has ordered a sweeping 100-day review of the threat and the means to respond to it on his first full day in office. And the Department of Homeland Security, created in response to 9/11, has changed how it operates. The White House has not endorsed McCaul's bill, which would give Biden an opening for bipartisan cooperation.
During the campaign, for instance, the candidate's platform did not address the future of Medicare, the vast federal insurance program for older or disabled Americans. The program has been strained financially for years, and the trust fund that pays for Medicare patients' hospital care is forecast to become insolvent in a dozen years. Before his election, Trump said repeatedly that he would not cut or change the program. I'm leaving it the way it is, he said in May.
After McCain's death in August, Trump drew widespread criticism after flags that had been lowered to half-staff at the White House were raised back to full staff before McCain's burial. Trump later issued a proclamation reversing the decision.
If the law passed, a person generally would not be affected unless they lived in a state that sought a waiver. Moreover, they would need to have a lapse in health coverage for longer than 63 days and they would need to have a preexisting condition. Finally, they would have to purchase insurance in the individual market – such as the health exchanges in Obamacare – that currently serves about 18 million Americans.
Significantly, coming off the Obama presidency, conservatives need to be able to speak about health care. They must acknowledge that the president has won an important battle: insurance coverage for all Americans is now the publicly accepted goal for health reform. Conservatives should accept this as given and work to reform our health care system in a way that leaves Americans with more choice, less central command-and-control, lower costs, and higher-quality care than Obamacare — that leaves Americans with a conservative ACA alternative.
She said the children are being transferred from cramped border stations — where some remained longer than the typical 72 hours in recent days because of a major winter storm in Texas — to shelters run by HHS.
She recounted how, in 1986, she was a teenager when she got a chance to go to New York, where an older actor booked her a hotel room. That night, Silverman, then 15 and staying alone, discovered that she could order pornographic movies on the hotel system. The next day, Ron Gibbs, who had booked the room, came by to check her out. Thirty-four years later, she called him to quiz him about the incident.
And yet, No. 4 is where we find ourselves this week.
The Post piece, from reporters Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein, notes that top White House advisers are divided on how far Republicans should go in repealing and replacing the ACA. One key point of disagreement centers on the Medicaid expansion, which would be repealed under the GOP measure, doing away with it as an entitlement and instead restricting funding via a per capita or block grant arrangement.

Increase the child tax credit. The proposal would streamline existing child credits into a single $1,500 credit and a $500 credit for non-child dependents.
The ruling follows a more limited injunction by a California judge on Sunday that temporarily blocked the rules in 13 states and the District of Columbia, both coming down just as the rules were set to take effect.

Generally, the Republican Party is still grappling with how to deal with this issue, the aide said. There are folks who know the party needs a position but are unsure of how to craft a policy, and there are still folks who don't think there is a federal nexus to be played.
-- Trump has been using executive orders to tie the hands of rule makers. He put in place a regulatory freeze during his first hours, mandated that two regulations be repealed for every new one that goes on the books and ordered a top-to-bottom review of the government with an eye toward shrinking it.
Biden's administration could reach non-filers by initially assigning the benefit to each child's birth mother, Bruenig said, with reassignment only happening if a custody change occurs. This would allow the benefit to be paid without anyone having to file a tax return and without having to know a parent's marital status, income or household situation, he added.

What are your priorities in improving health care: Expanding Medicaid? Reducing health-care costs for the middle class? Reducing drug prices?
Warren's base of support feels more durable than the polls suggest. She has a loyal following of college-educated, liberal women who have steadfastly supported her since last year. They love the idea that Warren could be the first female president, and they roar with approval when she talks about all the executive actions that a president can take all by herself.
— Our colleagues Aaron C. Davis and Neena Satija write of contracting firm Unispec Enterprises, whose employees' health insurance remains in limbo even as federal offices reopen, an example that reflects the razor-thin profit margin and unsettled nature of business for government contracting firms and their employees.
But those insurers may refuse payment for the medication, claiming that they may not have been approved for use by the patient. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Johnathan Monroe told the Times the agency is making it a top priority to to ensure that beneficiaries have access to the medications they need, including immunosuppressant drugs.
Trump also could try to energize his voters next year by blaming Washington's problems on the hostile establishment he says he is fighting.
To the extent it is not pursuing these matters, the Department is abdicating its responsibility, he added.
This morning, drug maker Braeburn will announce it has filed a petition asking the FDA to deny the medication Sublocade a special status giving its maker, Indivior, exclusive rights to sell the drug until 2024. Sublocade is a long-acting, injectable version of buprenorphine, one of three approved drugs that are highly effective in helping people beat back opioid addiction.

Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) has not yet ruled out running, saying in a statement that he will talk to family, New Mexicans, and supporters about the opportunity to serve our state in the U.S. Senate. Left-leaning Democrats are pushing for one of their own, like Rep. Deb Haaland or Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, to consider the race; a big question is whether Balderas, like Arizona's Kelly, decides to bigfoot the race. Neither party has elected a non-white senator in this majority-non-white state since Joseph Montoya's defeat in 1976.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said Thursday that the repeal measure could include some attempts to empower states to begin making health-care coverage decisions before a replacement bill is complete.
The call Monday came at the most challenging moment of Ryan's 17-month tenure as speaker: the failure of the American Health Care Act, for which he played the central role in assembling and promoting, throws into doubt the Republican Party's basic ability to govern even with unified control of the White House and Congress.

It's probably too soon to know whether the current divisions over the Hyde Amendment are going to last or not, Ziegler said.

Trump administration officials identified three areas that could need last-minute changes to win a more favorable impact score from the Congressional Budget Office and more support from members. Price said the administration and lawmakers are working to ensure that individuals transitioning off Medicaid do not fall through the cracks, that more coverage options are available and that opioid abuse is addressed.
The report also suggests the number of uninsured Americans has grown from 27.5 million in 2016 to 28.9 million in 2018, Vox's Sarah Kliff writes. A large part of the increase in the uninsured rate is from the Medicaid program – under President Trump, new regulations such as work requirements in various states have made it more difficult for potential beneficiaries to enroll in the program.

But following Trump's election, there were bigger questions about how the GOP president and his appointees would approach implementing a law that many were vehemently against. The will-they-or-won't-they-enforce-it narrative was intriguing because suddenly there was a Republican administration forced to carry out a law it had railed against. Plus, the whole sign-up period came at the end of a year where Congress was laser-focused on trying to upend the health-care law as we know it, which only increased the drama quotient.
And the Democrats' self-inflicted wounds keep coming. During Trump's State of the Union address, the House impeachment managers sat together in the chamber, sullen and stone-faced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) broke protocol and refused to utter the traditional words of introduction — it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce the president of the United States — and then dramatically tore up Trump's address on national television when he concluded. The image Democrats projected to the country was that of a bunch of sore losers.

— And here are a few more good reads:
Government is hard. American government is harder still. It's a political system designed to prevent tyranny, not facilitate speedy action. Power is checked, divided and shared. Making it work takes energy, ingenuity and, above all, a belief in government. Biden clearly learned from his experience running the stimulus program as President Barack Obama's vice president. Klain, who coordinated the response to Ebola in 2014-2015, is impressively focused on execution. Biden's covid-19 coordinator, Jeffrey Zients, is a talented executive who has excelled in the private and public sectors. (He may be best remembered for fixing the Obamacare website.)
It's the latest move from an administration that has sought to protect religious groups that are key supporters of the president. HHS specifically takes issue with the idea that an Obama-era rule barring discrimination on the basis of religion, sexual orientation or gender identity might force religious-based groups to have to place children in family arrangements inconsistent with their belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, Ariana writes.
At least one Senate Democrat who was previously for preserving the filibuster recently came out in favor of overhaul: Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told HuffPost's Igor Bobic earlier this month the filibuster has to be reformed, though it's unclear what kind of change Booker favors.
The FDA is considering giving the 2017 version of Sublocade orphan drug status – a special protection typically given only for drugs that treat extremely rare diseases as a way of encouraging the development of less-profitable products -- even though the medication could be used by as many as 2 million Americans who abuse opioids. That would mean Braeburn wouldn't be able to sell its similar version of the medication, Brixadi, for several more years. The company argues that's unfair, considering opioid addiction is hardly a rare disease and Indivior has already collected large profits from oral versions of buprenorphine.
In 2014, Cruz wanted to stop Obama's executive actions on immigration from going forward. But this time, he kept his plan to do so secret, explicitly avoiding a chance to share it with his Republican colleagues. That Friday, the Senate headed home thinking a $1 trillion spending deal was all but a done deal. But then Cruz appeared on the Senate floor to make an 11th-hour grandstand against Obama's immigration actions, effectively threatening the larger $1 trillion deal. Senators on their way home for the weekend had to turn around and spend all day Saturday in negotiations. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) used the unexpected opportunity to power through some of Obama's judicial nominations. The spending bill passed anyway. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said the surprise move shows a level of disrespect for your colleagues. Added Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah): I don't see an end goal other than just irritating a lot of people.
Based on some measures, the government already has more than $20 trillion in debt, and it must make large interest payments to continue borrowing. This is expected to eventually overwhelm the federal budget, particularly if interest rates rise. But Ryan's obsession with these issues was no longer shared by other conservative leaders, particularly after President Barack Obama was no longer in office.
A former GOP governor pointed out an irony:
Apart from that, Obama has maintained a low profile in the post-election world, with allies acknowledging that he's been absent as protests have built against his successor. At the NRDC's Tuesday media briefing, former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. said that the former president was ready to become a more visible supporter of the project.
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told Chao that he had probably the toughest question of the day for her and then asked whether she preferred University of Kentucky or University of Louisville basketball teams.
Democrats seemed delighted that the court had decided to ignore that advice. They said the focus on health care will help their candidates, as polls show it did in 2018 when Democrats won back the House majority, and increase the importance of the Supreme Court with their voters.
Increasing ACA subsidies and widening who can get them would represent a first step by Congress to embrace President Biden's credo of using the sweeping — and politically polarizing — law as the main tool for improving the nation's health-care system, Amy Goldstein reports.
And there are other reasons for optimism going into the spring: The seven-day average for new daily coronavirus cases in the United States fell below 58,000 for the first time since mid-October, and hospitalizations are also down dramatically. Federal health officials cited these statistics in a decision to relax government guidelines on nursing home visits. Still, experts urge caution as new variants of the virus spread, and health officials worry that spring break travel could spark new outbreaks.
TRUMP: ... I think I'm talking...
Politico's Darren Samuelsohn reports: To help pick jurors for a possible three-week trial [in Alexandria], Mueller's team provided a list of 52 potential questions seeking more information about the jurors, including whether they'd 'seen, read, or heard anything at all about this case in any form of media, including newspaper, television, radio or internet.' If a potential juror checks the yes box, they're asked to explain what they've seen and the 'source of that information.'
On his plan for tax cuts, Trump said that we're getting very close to putting together legislation. His advisers and Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign's plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. It'll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great ­middle-class tax cuts, Trump said.
OUCH: Lifesaving therapies for breast cancer patients, like chemotherapy and radiation, can cause heart failure and other serious cardiac problems, sometimes years after treatment, the American Heart Association said in a stark warning issued yesterday. The organization said patients and doctors shouldn't avoid the treatments but instead take steps to prevent or minimize the cardiac risks, The Post's Laurie McGinley reports. It stressed that breast cancer survivors can improve their chances of a long, healthy life by exercising regularly and sticking to a healthy diet.
Republicans have sometimes shied away from tackling these problems head on, Ernst wrote in an op-ed published by the Des Moines Register on Saturday. I'm trying to change that. Meanwhile, Democrats have been happy to unveil so-called solutions that increase the growing deficit and simply take more money out of every Iowan's paycheck.
Because many people would pay premiums and other forms of cost-sharing, they would have some skin in the game. Between this and the fact that employer insurance would continue , the cost to the government would be about $98 billion in the first year — a lot, to be sure, but far less than a switch to single-payer. Insurers would be protected from catastrophic costs through permanent reinsurance and risk-adjustment programs, mechanisms that stabilized the system in Obamacare's early years. Given the size of the new market, more insurers and most providers would probably participate.

The Medicare for All Act of 2019, which Jayapal had planned to roll out this week but delayed because she was seeking more co-sponsors, would create a government-run single-payer health system even more generous than the current Medicare program. Her office hasn't publicly released the details of the upcoming measure, but Democratic members told me it would cover long-term care and mental health services, two areas where Medicare coverage is sparse.
At the time, McCain said he didn't like the backdoor process by which the bill came to form. In his new book, The Restless Wave, McCain wrote that he thought the bill didn't do much beyond undoing current law: I'm not sure we'll ever agree on a replacement, and so perhaps all we can do is try to fix parts of Obamacare.
Biden has started going after Sanders directly almost every chance he gets. We've just had significant disagreements with Bernie, but the way he talks about it, you'd think he and Barack were close buddies, he said Sunday night on MSNBC. I know they were not.
Twenty-eight hundred, he read out loud. It was not yet 11 on Wednesday morning, and democracy was just getting started.
Sens. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Kristin Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Edward J. Markey (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Tina Smith (Minn.) and Alex Padilla (Calif.)
See, that's why I came here, because you people support me no matter what, Trump-as-Baldwin tells them. It's like you found a finger in your chili, but you still eat the chili because you told everyone how much you love chili.
All told, the AHCA would allot $138 billion over 10 years for a variety of funds that would seek to keep premiums lower or to assist with cost-sharing. Just this week, $8 billion over five years was added to the pot to woo wavering lawmakers, with the idea that the additional funds could be used for so-called high-risk pools. Many states had such pools to help people with preexisting conditions before the ACA. But the proposal does not require a state with a waiver to set up such a pool.
Second, ACA benefits are not consistently generous enough to build the strong and cohesive national constituency enjoyed by programs such as Social Security. Many families still face rising health-care bills, which hits especially hard for working-class families in the 17 states that have not embraced Medicaid expansion. Other adults may not be able to afford insurance because they earn too much to qualify for substantial (or any) federal support.
Trump thought he would lose the election
Basically, we essentially have a group who are heavily addicted — in my view, enslaved by a ridiculously bad industry — which has enslaved them by designing a cigarette that is highly addictive, knowing that it highly lethal. And it is, Democratic state Rep. Richard Creagan, the bill's co-sponsor, told the Hawaii Tribune-Herald.
-- Elizabeth Warren spoke for many Democrats when she wondered:
A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus did not comment on Trump's tweet or Poe's departure. It was unclear whether Trump's statement had a direct effect on Poe's decision to leave the caucus.
No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity, he writes on Twitter.
The fate of Obamacare could — once again — hinge on the Supreme Court, which has installed two conservative justices since it voted to uphold the landmark health-care law in 2012.
Interestingly, Republicans ran in the 1950 midterm campaign on a message of Liberty versus socialism. It didn't take hold, though. Gallup polling early in the campaign showed most people weren't familiar with the slogan, and a February 1950 poll showed 36 percent thought it was a real issue.
Trump encouraged his Twitter followers Saturday to watch Jeanine Pirro, one of his favorite Fox News Channel hosts, that night.
Fourteen hundred and forty-two times the ACA said 'the secretary shall' or 'the secretary may,'  Price replised.
External signs of Trump's daily behaviors – his affinity for fast food, lack of exercise and short nights – cast doubt on a past claim by his personal physician that Trump is the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.
Nearly two dozen states and D.C. have vaccinated at least two-thirds of adults over age 65, the Kaiser Family Foundation found in an analysis of the 33 states that report age data for vaccinations. Kaiser found that the share of seniors who have received at least one dose of the vaccine ranges from 49 percent in North Carolina to 27 percent in Pennsylvania (although we should note the report was released one week ago, and the share of those vaccinated probably has increased since then).
The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group that opposes the AHCA, produced an analysis that indicated that even with the additional $8 billion, the maximum enrollment the AHCA's funds would cover is about 700,000 people. If just 5 percent of the people currently in the individual market ended up in high-risk pools – and all states sought a waiver – that would overwhelm the proposed funding.
We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.
Northam carried five Senate districts currently held by Republicans: Richard H. Black (Loudoun), William R. DeSteph Jr. (Virginia Beach), Siobhan S. Dunnavant (Henrico), Glen H. Sturtevant Jr. (Richmond) and Wagner. If they are feeling political pressure from that, only Wagner has shown it. The remaining four have been opposed to Medicaid expansion, and two reached for comment Tuesday said that was still the case.
I Love You, America, which ran from 2017 to 2018, embraced that evolution. In one early segment, Silverman traveled to Louisiana to visit a family of rabid Donald Trump supporters. During the visit, she led a discussion about health insurance, and it became clear that the family, which had been mercilessly bashing Obama, was covered by Obamacare.
And if the federal government reduces its share of funding, the plan calls for Virginia to end the program. Approving it under these conditions is going to make a difference for many, many Virginians, Jones said.
-- Privately, Trump and his aides are growing increasingly anxious over Democratic maneuvering — alarmed by the news that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has hired Abigail Grace, who served as an Asia policy staffer on the National Security Council during the Trump administration until departing last spring for a think tank. Seung Min Kim, David Nakamura and Josh Dawsey report:
With a large pipe organ behind her, Warren paced the stage and seemed to draw energy from the crowd like an old-fashioned evangelist. We're going to get knocked down, she told a capacity crowd of 785 people inside a magnificent church sanctuary that was built in the 1820s. We're going to find bumpy times, and we'll find hard times, and we'll find times when we think, 'Oh, this hurts.' But the thing is: People are counting on us to get this right. … It's about getting off our back foot and getting on our front foot.

This group of four GOP senators, it bears noting, could kill any health-care bill. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, meaning that if Democrats vote in unison, Republicans can only afford two defections.
And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.
New York and Minnesota sued the Trump administration in January; the case was settled in May when the administration agreed to work with the states on a new funding formula for their programs. In the meantime, the federal government paid the states an interim payment of $151 million to New York and $17.2 million to Minnesota.
In addition to Biden's Super Bowl interview, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has done CNN's State of the Union and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on ABC's This Week.
In an age when political commentary is getting shallower and more vituperative , we will especially miss Charles's style of writing — calm, carefully constructed arguments based on propositions and evidence, tinged with a cutting wit and wry humor but never malice, writes — calm, carefully constructed arguments based on propositions and evidence, tinged with a cutting wit and wry humor but never malice, writes Pete Wehner , who has worked for the past three GOP presidents. [He was] temperamentally moderate, deeply suspicious of ideology, aware of the complexity of human society, and empirical in the sense that he was constantly testing what he was saying against what was actually happening in the world … Charles had no interest in being a member of a political team; his goal was to better understand reality.
The memo distributed to lawmakers says that states would be able to choose whether to receive a block grant or remain in the traditional, capped program. But the states that participated in the ACA's Medicaid expansion would eventually lose out on much of the federal funding they have used to cover millions of Americans.
The risks of an early political backlash for Biden are growing. Former president Donald Trump dispatched his deputies to the Hill on Wednesday to lobby against Biden's immigration overhauls, and Trump plans to blast those changes in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday.
If the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms. King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015). Although the meaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context, id., the statutory provisions in this case are clear in isolation and in context. The Affordable Care Act unambiguously appropriates money for Section 1401 premium tax credits but not for Section 1402 reimbursements to insurers. Such an appropriation cannot be inferred. None of Secretaries' extra-textual arguments—whether based on economics, unintended results, or legislative history—is persuasive. The Court will enter judgment in favor of the House of Representatives and enjoin the use of unappropriated monies to fund reimbursements due to insurers under Section 1402. The Court will stay its injunction, however, pending appeal by either or both parties.
With Mr. Trump, if the candidate himself is to be believed, there is no such certainty. A voter's first obligation should be to preserve the republic which has been, for so long, the envy of the world.
Herring said the family has invested hundreds of millions in One America, but its prime-time audience remains only about one-seventh that of Fox News, according to ComScore ratings. OAN airs few commercials; the Herrings are skeptical of advertising as a prime revenue source, relying instead on subscriber fees that cable systems pay content providers for their programming.
This is debatable. At the very least, one might count the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the end of the Cold War as victories for the United States.
McCaul: I think primarily the government should support our companies and support them when they are under attack by the [Chinese Communist Party]. We should also condemn American companies who seem to be aligned with them, like what we saw with the NBA. There's a moral obligation … for us to look at the Uighur Muslim population being ethnically cleansed in an act of genocide. We can't just whitewash these human rights abuses. We've got an opportunity with the Olympics to make a statement. I introduced a bill to basically … educate athletes going overseas as to how the Chinese Communist Party operates with respect to surveillance and their more clandestine authorities.
Did you watch the press conference? one Republican congressman asked another as they got on an elevator back in Washington.
He's a master at messaging, at using the same phrases over and over, like 'Make America Great Again' or 'carnage'. . . that fit easily into a chyron and reinforce his message, she said. It's impossible to get any context across in a chyron about those things. Print [reporters] can put the facts and the context in. TV really can't. It doesn't really have a mechanism for that.

The plan… would mean that veterans could see private doctors at taxpayer expense when VA medical centers are unable to provide timely treatment or the care is deemed inadequate, she adds. Still, it may take years to assess the full impact on veterans who turn to private doctors over government-run VA care, due to uncertainty in how the rules will be interpreted and how VA determines what is 'quality' care.
Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a guest of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.):
Trump will receive his annual physical at Walter Reed today. He has no other events on his public schedule.
We were very surprised by one gentleman, Trump said Tuesday while speaking to reporters at the White House.
But the agency has also advanced a number of measures that raise the ire of Democrats and liberals, perhaps most notably by allowing states to institute Medicaid work requirements and expanding insurance plans exempt from some ACA requirements. HHS has also made it easier for employers to refuse to cover birth control for their employees and is poised to release a new regulation banning abortion providers from receiving federal family planning dollars.
If approved, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine would be the third authorized vaccine in the United States. The vaccine requires only a single shot and can be stored at refrigerator temperatures for several months, promising easier logistics compared to the two other vaccines currently authorized in the U.S.
Biden then ripped into Sanders for supporting a bill to limit liability for gun manufacturers. Bernie's a good guy, said Biden. He talks about how we all make mistakes. Well, he didn't tell you he voted five times against the Brady Bill and the waiting period. He voted against allowing us to go up and sue the companies that created this havoc.
In 33 states, doctors and their patients have the option to use medical marijuana to manage pain—unless those doctors work for the VA and their patients are veterans, Schatz said in a statement. This bill gives VA doctors in these states the option to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans, and it also promises to shed light on how medical marijuana can help with the nation's opioid epidemic.
His time is now. He's ready, longtime Wisconsin GOP activist Brandon Scholz said. This guy has been on the phone nonstop since Ryan announced his retirement.
I think that when you wake up on Friday and see the enormous crowds that are there, you're going to recognize that it is going to be an inauguration for all Americans. Obviously we'd love for every member of Congress to attend, but if they don't, that's some great seats that other folks can hopefully partake in.
You know what keeps me up at night? said Clark County Public Health Director Alan Melnick. Measles is exquisitely contagious. If you have an under-vaccinated population and you introduce a measles case into that population, it will take off like a wildfire.
A geographer shared this interesting view of the world:
Her win is more proof that Democrats are riled up: Remember, Democrats won a shocking upset in January in a special election for a Wisconsin state House seat. Trump had carried the district by 17 points in 2016, which was key to his narrow statewide victory.
So when Cruz finished giving a floor speech blaming Democrats for federal employees' furloughs and pushing a bill that would pay just the Coast Guard during the shutdown, Bennet had a harsh response.
Under the Senate draft, federal Medicaid spending would remain as is for three years. Then in 2021 it would be transformed from an open-ended entitlement to a system based on per capita enrollment. Starting in 2025, the measure would tie federal spending on the program to an even slower growth index, which in turn could prompt states to reduce the size of their Medicaid programs.

Biden insisted yesterday that he's not viewing the additional shots from Johnson & Johnson as surplus supply.
They [Hillary Clinton] had a tiny, little crowd, and I had I'd like to say more, but I can't have more than this because every seat is gone, and outside you have 25,000 people. And I remember leaving, and I said so she's got 500 people, and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. So she's here at prime time 7:30, I'm here at 1 in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000.
You going to come? asks Conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.
All of this means that the various interwoven fantasies Trump has played upon — that the GOP leadership's lack of spine is to blame for the party's failure to win more; that voter fraud is rampant; that dark hordes flooding over the southern border constitute an existential threat to the country — could conceivably be strengthened by a Trump loss.
Buttigieg didn't do it as the Medicare-for-all candidate. He did it as the Medicare-for-all-who-want-it candidate.
During the balanced-budget debate a decade later, Biden cited that proposal to show that he cared about budget deficits. 'When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government,' Biden said in a Jan. 31, 1995, speech on the Senate floor. But the Biden campaign also cites dozens of examples of votes cast by Biden to shield Social Security from cuts or to expand benefits.
Maine voters approved expansion in November 2017, although the state has been slow in implementing it under opposition from former governor Paul LePage. Newly elected Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has vowed to swiftly put an expansion program in place.
At that moment, the fresh-faced Wisconsin congressman embodied the ideals and aspirations of a Republican Party stirred by his bold proposals about adhering to fiscal discipline while presenting a welcoming face to immigrants and to the world.
Yes. Just as at any given time, a simple majority of senators could vote to end it for good, it could be modified in the same way. In fact, senators have limited its use twice in the past decade, both times in regard to confirmations of presidential appointments. In 2013, Democrats established that a simple majority vote could advance nominees for lower-court judgeships and federal agencies. In 2017, the Republicans who then held the majority voted to allow a simple majority vote to confirm Supreme Court nominees. So far, most legislation can still be filibustered.
Beyond Trump, the proliferation of chyrons on news broadcasts tells a larger story about the way people watch TV now. They are, in some respects, an attempted antidote to expanding TV options and declining attention spans.

But the need remains great. A Mexican man detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection died this week at a medical facility, however, Maria writes. And advocacy groups warn that the remote areas where families are crossing, and the agency's crowded detention facilities, still pose serious risks — especially for young children.
Democrats will now have the chance to challenge whether individual elements of the House bill, including waivers to allow insurers to drop protections included in the ACA, like mandatory coverage of prenatal and maternity care, can stay in the Senate bill.
So you would make a report to Congress? Kennedy asked.
Those jitters hint at a rocky road ahead as Republicans start trying to fulfill a long-standing campaign promise. They have forced GOP leaders to reassure lawmakers that they will not move precipitously and open Republicans to charges they threw the health-care system into chaos.
AutoMedx appears to be the beneficiary of a potentially tainted procurement process, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), the subcommittee's chairman, wrote in letters to the companies.

The same situation holds in the move against Obamacare. If Trump gets Obamacare tossed out, he claims a victory. If not, he's no worse off than he is now, and he can add criticism of the federal courts to his complaints about the vote against Obamacare repeal by the dying Sen. John McCain.

The report also claims credit for this year's expanded insurance options in the ACA marketplaces and premiums that, on average, decreased for the first time.
-- Special counsel Bob Mueller's prosecutors allege that Paul Manafort continued working on Ukrainian political matters even after he was indicted. Spencer S. Hsu, Rosalind S. Helderman and Matt Zapotosky report: The details came in a partially redacted transcript released Thursday of a sealed hearing between prosecutors and the defense team for Trump's former campaign chairman … At the hearing, attorneys discussed whether Manafort may have been motivated to lie in one unspecified instance 'to at least augment his chances for a pardon,' the transcript states, suggesting prosecutors' suspicion that Manafort might be trying to deceive them even now, after his guilty plea in September in Washington, in the hope of winning a reprieve from the president. In another instance during the hearing, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann alleged Manafort may have lied to hide a scheme to funnel cash to himself while doing unpaid work for the Trump campaign.
For example, they focused on drug prices in their Better Deal agenda if they take control of Congress, including a proposal to let Medicare use its buying power to bargain down the cost of medications. Trump had taken the unusual step for a Republican of embracing the proposal during his 2016 campaign, telling an enthusiastic crowd in New Hampshire that it could unlock huge savings. But the president hasn't followed through or endorsed the idea when Democrats have proposed it.
From there, the story of the Federalist Society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. That's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. My admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen Federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual Federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.
Trump, Barr said, asked him questions about Mueller. Barr said he told Trump he was friends with the special counsel and his family, and they would be good friends when this was all over. He said Trump asked about Mueller's integrity.

AHH: CDC Director Robert Redfield has agreed to take a pay cut from $375,000 to $209,700, putting his compensation more in line with those of previous agency chiefs, The Post's Lena H. Sun reports. Redfield had recently come under fire for enjoying a salary much higher than his predecessors.
The report found 118 children were taken into custody between July and early November, after the administration announced it was halting its controversial family separation effort. But the report also says even before the government announced its family separation policy, thousands of other children were separated from their families starting early in the administration, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports. The inspector general report found no one was systematically keeping count of separated children until the zero tolerance policy triggered a lawsuit.

McConnell is leaving any new health-care proposal to White House officials. Instead, he wants to put the focus back on Medicare-for-all to divide Democrats and appeal to swing voters by saying Democrats would bankrupt the government with their far-left policies.
Early one morning in March 2016, Herring emailed producers with a directive, two hours before former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was to denounce Trump as very, very not smart: Do not carry the Romney speech live, Herring wrote.

INSIDE BIDEN'S CALL WITH CHINA'S PRESIDENT: During their first call, Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing's coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan, our colleague Anne Gearan reports.
This part of the story has been well understood for many years; what has puzzled observers is why polarization has more recently intensified into what political scientists label affective polarization, a highly emotional attachment to one's side that defies considerations of rational self-interest. Here Klein, like many others, reaches into the realm of social psychology and notes a basic human propensity to form powerful group attachments: Being red or blue has come to constitute an identity rather than an ideology. He cites a large literature suggesting that human cognition does not begin with facts and work its way to interpretations; rather, humans start with preexisting identities and use their considerable cognitive skills to justify positions they somehow know in advance to be right. Under these conditions, having more facts and information does not necessarily lead to better decisions. Klein cites one rather depressing study in which better-informed partisans were more attached to their incorrect opinions than people who were more ignorant.
This complete abdication of governing responsibility was confirmed Tuesday when the party's nominal leader, President Trump, announced to the country, I think we are probably in that position where we will just let Obamacare fail. … I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.
What was clear Thursday is that Trump intends to take a hands-off approach to overhauling the health-care system — for now, at least. He had earlier pledged, including to The Washington Post shortly before his inauguration, that he had a health-care plan very much formulated down to the final strokes to be introduced once Price was confirmed. At a news conference Thursday, Trump again said his plan was in the final stages and would be submitted to Congress in March.
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who helped write the Senate legislation, on Tuesday pressed for her fellow negotiators to finish their work and adopt the Senate-passed language.
People will argue that individuals are ultimately responsible for their choices, but we know that the environment in which we make choices matters, said study author Alyssa Moran, an assistant professor of health and social policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This study is another example of industry targeting sugary beverage marketing toward lower income families.
At the debate, we will see whether Sanders attacks Biden, contradicting his stated intention to pull the party together and beat Trump. Whatever Sanders does, Biden should stay the course. He should stick to his pledge to expand Obamacare, pursue an aggressive agenda to halt climate change, reiterate his record fighting the National Rifle Association (which Sanders cannot match), recommit to immigration reform (which Sanders voted against in 2007), and generally remind voters that his agenda is progressive; it's just not needlessly provocative or unattainable.
This epidemic is destroying America, the fiber of who we are…but at the end of the day we'll continue to make America safer and more secure and more prosperous, McCarthy said.
Schumer has tried to downplay Democratic differences while highlighting the GOP divide. That made it hard to hold the line on the shutdown. Rather than let the party fracture, Democrats settled for a promise. We could well see a replay when the new short-term funding bill runs out next month.
Sister Jodyne listens to each episode eagerly.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked Azar why Trump went back on his word about allowing FDA-approved drugs to be imported from other countries, specifically Canada. Azar said the president hasn't changed his mind but there needed to be a way to ensure such a practice was done safely. Sanders replied, I always have a hard time understanding that we can safely -- quote, unquote -- import fish, poultry from all over the world, and, somehow, from a highly developed country on our border, we cannot figure out a way to bring those products back into this country.
De Blasio also chimed in, defending immigrants against those who have criticized them, addressing those who feel the American Dream has passed them by. The immigrants didn't do that to you, he said.

No president and his party are on the same page on everything (see President Obama vs. congressional Democrats on trade). And Ryan and Trump have both expressed support for replacing Obamacare as soon as possible after they repeal it. (Though the devil is in the details. Ryan said Thursday it could be done within the next three months; Trump theorized a replacement plan will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.)
Warnock's style also might be his best asset in the runoff, helping him match the emotional pitch of the moment as Americans suffer through the hardest stretch of the pandemic and President Trump spreads wild conspiracy theories about America's voting system and the officials (including Republicans, and especially Georgia Republicans) who administer it.
Phil writes Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University warned the actions coming out of Idaho and Utah could chill other potential Medicaid expansion ballot referendums planned for 2020 in Florida and other states.
The bitter opposition to Price's nomination … served as a preview of the fight to come over the future of American health care. And Price could well start that fight immediately by using his authority as secretary to roll back or not enforce select pieces of Obamacare — the mandated benefit package, perhaps, or the hot-button birth control coverage rules.
Ryan (R-Wis.) did not disclose details of what the next iteration of health-care reform might look like, but he suggested that a plan was being developed in time to brief the donors at a retreat scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Florida. His remarks indicated that Republicans may be trying to regroup more quickly than Ryan had suggested they would on Friday, when he declared Obamacare the law of the land for the foreseeable future.
Those gathered will not necessarily oppose Trump and some may even be friendly to some of his policies, said Darrell Bock of Dallas Theological Seminary, who is also helping to organize the event. But organizers said evangelicals need to return their focus to the term's true definition: a person who believes in the authority of the Bible, salvation through Jesus' work on the cross, personal conversion and the need for evangelism.
Biden looks and sounds like a winner. That's because he is. And Sanders, as he promised and as the vast number of Democrats have decided, should get behind Biden now. If not, I am rather certain Warren and other progressive stars would be happy to campaign with Biden while Sanders sulks. It's time the left had a new standard-bearer, anyway, preferably — from their standpoint — someone who is more electable and likable.
Heller said he was open to voting for the legislation — but only if leaders agree to changes before a procedural vote scheduled for Tuesday. The changes he seeks, particularly his call for higher growth rates, could alienate conservatives and threaten the delicate balance McConnell is still trying to strike.
RUBIO: ... Donald has not demonstrated that.
— former representative Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), in remarks in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, March 15
And did George H.W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, did John McCain say a single good word about anything Barack Obama ever did over the course of eight solid years?
March organizers announced Wednesday that Trump would address the event via satellite. They noted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had addressed the march by telephone, Reagan in 1987 and Bush in 2008.
Instead, Trump has spent the past few days, including the hours before and after the church service, rallying his most loyal supporters around his nationalist agenda against illegal immigration, attacking a familiar list of perceived enemies and adding new ones, all while casting himself as a victim of unfair attacks. It was a weekend of nonstop grievances from the leader of the free world, per Gearan.
BAIER: Gentlemen, the next series of questions will be on social issues. Governor Kasich, the last debate, you were asked a question about religious liberty, in a hypothetical situation where a same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding. Here's what you said.
A little more than an hour later, Lamb took the stage at his party in Canonsburg to declare victory.
Even before they left Richmond, House Republicans faced attention-grabbing criticism. Corey Stewart, a Trump supporter vying for the chance to take on U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in the fall, brandished a roll of toilet paper as he called expanders flaccid. Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) said he would resign from leadership if he ever found himself out on a limb like House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who voted for expansion.
Trump frequently exaggerates the size of trade deficits — with Mexico, it was $78 billion in 2018, $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016. Countries do not lose money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.
Trump's campaign has directed much of its energy to highlighting shifts to the left among Democrats and to touting the president's accomplishments. The president himself often boasts about the strong U.S. economy, tax cuts and deregulation under his watch.
Fred Hiatt: Isn't that going make the tax system fairly complicated, more complicated?
While African Americans still have the highest death rate and lowest survival rate among any racial or ethnic group for most cancers, the overall cancer mortality rate for blacks has decreased faster than for whites because of major declines in common cancers, including lung, prostate and colorectal cancer.
In some ways, he may fare better under the House proposal, which would continue to require insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions. And although Blanchard's high salary precludes him from qualifying for any premium subsidy under the ACA, he would get a modest tax credit under the GOP plan — about $500 a year.
She may be out of luck, said Steve Bell, a former GOP budget analyst, now with the Bipartisan Policy Institute.
AHH: The Biden administration won't let more physicians prescribe buprenorphine.
Save My Care said it will air its ad on cable news during Azar's 10 a.m. testimony today, as part of a five-figure campaign to pressure Idaho into complying with the ACA. The ads will air in Boise, Idaho and the District of Columbia:
Tristan North, vice president of government affairs at the American Ambulance Association, said easing the payment rules is essential for ambulance service providers in the hardest-hit areas of the country.
It is not clear the extent to which the separation policy actually contributed to deterring families from arriving at the border, though, according to multiple administration officials, that was explicitly one of the points of the program. While the number of family units apprehended at the border held steady from March to July, that period includes a month after the policy was ended. What's more, there were far fewer family units apprehended in those same months of 2017 when there was no explicit policy of separation.
The president's abrupt abandonment of his push to once again try to repeal and replace Obamacare caught congressional Republicans off guard, our colleagues Erica Werner and John Wagner report. The late-night tweets from Trump followed a conversation with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who told reporters he made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate during the campaign season.
Molly Roberts: And you don't think that there's any role for government to say, Hey, here are ways that information is abused and is exploited. Let's outlaw it. So that Americans who are kind of currently drowning in the control they have but don't know how to exercise over their data are protected anyway.
The data are disturbing, said Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director. The widespread nature of the increase, in every state but one, really suggests that this is a national problem hitting most communities.
One other small matter that I just wanted to touch on, there's been some misreporting about the status of the nominee paperwork. To be clear, all of our nominees have completed the necessary paperwork and submitted it to both the OGE and the FBI. With regard to the OGE, all three of our nominees have cleared the OGE agreement process.
Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn't work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high — Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. (Tweet, April 1)
Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an outspoken Trump ally, said fellow GOP lawmakers will ultimately need to support a consensus plan.
But how Trump communicates with the rest world continues to concern McConnell as he tries to pass a sweeping agenda.
Voters do not want an ideologue; they want someone who empathizes with them and speaks to real problems in their lives. They want someone to talk plainly, not sound like a televangelist or high school drama student. They will accept, if not demand, someone who is tolerant of gay marriage. They do not demand stale conservative orthodoxy; they want to know who can make their lives better.
We've been having some staff-level discussions with the Administration about lowering prescription drug prices, but they aren't negotiations. House Democrats promised the American people we'd take bold action to lower prescription drug prices, and that's what we're going to do, Pelosi's deputy communications director Henry Connelly told Politico.
Announce the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump did this on his third day in office.
But the liberal shift, and the lawmakers driving it, are also creating challenges for Democrats in more-conservative areas, and they are giving President Trump and congressional Republicans fresh opportunities for political attacks, our Post colleagues Seung Min Kim, Annie Linskey and Rachael Bade report.
TRUMP: It's a minor civil case.
POST PROGRAMMING ALERT: Today, The Post will host some of the country's leading mental-health experts and policymakers for a live discussion of strategies to address the most pressing mental-health challenges, including the increasing rate of suicide, combating the stigma associated with mental illness and improving access to care for at-risk populations.

In an interview, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb said he was worried that there are either deliberate or unintentional efforts by branded companies to create confusion about the safety and effectiveness of unbranded versions of drugs, adding that kind of message can potentially undermine consumer confidence in biosimilars in ways that are untrue.''
Six of the eight counties that voted the most overwhelmingly for Clinton run in a line from The Bronx to Petersburg, Va. (The other two counties are San Francisco and Oglala Lakota County, S.D.) On Wednesday of this week, I visited five of those counties and spoke with two dozen people who told me they'd voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. I asked them how they felt about Trump and if they stood by their 2016 vote.
Use the time you have to upskill and prepare for when the country is open for business again, he said. Set aside adequate time for this. Make it your 'job' to prepare yourself for your next position.

Van Hollen, who built a reputation over two decades in public office as a policy-steeped negotiator and who rose quickly into the House Democratic leadership, ultimately triumphed over Edwards, a black single mother with an activist history but fewer political allies.
What Democrats should be doing is laying out some core principles about what should be in the bills, Lake said. People like them a lot but don't know what's in them.

Authorities said Wright then stood in front of the vehicle to try to keep Kustoff from leaving. At some point, someone called 911, but Wright left before authorities arrived.
The current press attention that these legal cases in the United States is generating has created immense pressure on the scientific, medical, educational and arts institutions here in the UK, large and small, that I am so proud to support, Theresa Sackler, the trust's chair, said in a statement.
General Kelly was previously confirmed by the Senate under unanimous consent (inaudible). He has gained strong bipartisan support from such leaders as former Congressman Jane Harman, currently the director the Woodrow Wilson Center. She said, quote, I'm positive about it. I think this guy has enormous credibility that he will get the lead assignment on the border, end quote.
KELLY: ... The audience cannot understand when you're talking over each other. Finish your point, Mr. Trump.
Then, for a period of one year, a person who fell into this category would face insurance rates that could be based on their individual condition. But states that seek a waiver are required to operate a risk mitigation program or participate in what is called an invisible risk sharing program. Alaska currently has such a program that helps cover the bills for one of 33 conditions (such as HIV/AIDS or metastatic cancer). The individual with the condition still submits bills to the insurance company, which then turns around and bills the state. But then the insurance company does not consider the cost of this care as part of its calculation for premiums to other individuals in the state.
I haven't seen any evidence to that effect, Thune said of Trump's assertion that massive voter fraud occurred Nov. 8. Thune reasserted his faith in the 2016 elections — which, he said, left a decisive outcome with Republicans firmly in control of Congress and the White House. He said Republicans must focus on legislating.
But chyrons have also been a boon to Trump, who has exploited the brevity and constancy of them to his own political advantage, Hall said.
What's wrong with you? You hit my car, you b----.
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, one-quarter of U.S. households are unbanked or underbanked. Big banks hassle low-income consumers with fees for everyday services. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, prohibits banks from opening accounts for people without physical mailing addresses, such as refugees and the homeless. Technophobes in the Trump administration, led by Steven Mnuchin, are trying to make these problems worse through slapdash restrictions proposed last month.
The White House is canceling a last-minute plan by the Trump administration to let more physicians prescribe an opioid-treatment drug, despite exhortations from lawmakers and physician groups to keep it, our colleague Dan Diamond reports.

The growing field of Democrats campaigning to make Trump a one-term president sees his hard-line immigration views as out of line with moderate voters. Several have highlighted Trump's family separation policy and accused him of racism.
I don't hold myself as a foreign policy expert, but I think the Russians are a potent rival of our country and his foreign policy objectives are, usually are directly contrary to our goals, Barr told Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who asked Barr whether Putin was a friend or foe. A lot of his foreign policy objectives are at odds with ours.
When our colleagues asked Gottlieb about the stem cell procedures in question, he acknowledged the agency hasn't always aggressively enforced its regulations. But as the lawsuit continues, he has said the FDA will take action against other such companies that put patients at risk.
[When governing beckons, Trump keeps campaigning]
It's even more influential now than it was when he used to, for years, have a weekly interview on the program. Trump and Fox and Friends have long had a symbiotic relationship, and, now that he's president, he hasn't left his friends behind. Of course, he loves the show primarily because it is unfailingly sunny in its coverage of Trump's presidency — and more than willing to push his political position even at the expense of the Republican Party generally. This, of course, is why other outlets haven't stud[ied] your formula for success. The formula for becoming the most influential show ran through being the most obsequious.
O'Rourke: We can't return to the same old approaches. We are going to need a new politics.
Outside a nail salon, Kimberly Pitt, 38, was blunt in her assessment: I don't like Trump.
If it happens, it will start in Colorado, where Republican Sen. Cory Gardner has an approval rating south of 40 percent. Popular Democratic former governor John Hickenlooper ran for president last year, but polls and donors pointed him toward the Senate instead. Like a lion on a limping gazelle, he has Gardner by the throat. One poll showed Hickenlooper ahead by 13 points, with a majority of voters in his favor.
If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?
But I've been supporting politicians. A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody. I've supported Democrats, and I've supported Republicans. And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.
Under the Affordable Care Act championed by President Barack Obama, Washington encouraged states to allow more people to enroll in Medicaid by offering to pick up most of the tab. Thirty-two states, including Maryland and the District of Columbia, accepted the offer.
Nearly every state is prioritizing seniors for shots, but the task is enormous.
Scott Reed, a lobbyist for the Chamber, said he continues to believe there is a historic opportunity for Congress to pass tax reform and make good on a Trump promise to invest $1 trillion in the nation's infrastructure — both of which are Chamber priorities.

Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
Trump also said that nationwide, one in three U.S. counties have only a single insurer. That's correct, but many of these counties are rural and sparsely populated, so in reality about 20 percent of the people on the exchanges have only a choice of one insurance carrier.
The court is considering a case brought by Republican-led states and endorsed by the Trump administration.
Correction: The Indiana provisions are both included in a single law, not two laws as The Health 202 wrote originally.
Officials portrayed it as a 'groundbreaking opportunity' for states to upgrade care, limit the program's strain on their budgets, and gain more freedom to shape Medicaid to local needs, my Washington Post colleague Amy Goldstein explains.
As pumped as anyone is Olowski, watching with me from the side. But to understand what the Federalist Society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at Federalist Society chapters and forums across the land.
McCarthy's account accurately describes the dynamics of passing the American Health Care Act, the Republican ACA alternative, in 2017, Mike reports. But it sidesteps the Republican leadership's role in backing what became known as the MacArthur Amendment and ultimately forcing a vote on a bill that faced uncertain prospects in the Senate and put scores of GOP lawmakers on the political defensive.
Senators of both parties stood up, leaned forward, and appeared to identify themselves in the chilling security footage showing Capitol police officers creating a human barricade that allowed them to flee the Chamber ,  Politico's Marianne Levine, Sarah Ferris, Melanie Zanona and Andrew Desiderio report .

Current rules generally only allow ambulance service providers to be reimbursed if they take the patient to the closest hospital or clinic.
McConnell is about to plunge the Senate into the nation's culture wars with votes on bills to sharply restrict access to late-term abortions and threaten some doctors who perform them with criminal penalties, signaling that Republicans plan to make curbing a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy a central theme of their re-election campaigns this year, the Times reports. After months of shunning legislative activity in favor of confirming [Trump's] judicial nominees — and a brief detour for the president's impeachment trial — [McConnell] is expected to bring the bills up for votes on Tuesday. Both lack the necessary 60-vote supermajority to advance, and the Senate has voted previously to reject them. But by putting them on the floor again, Mr. McConnell hopes to energize the social conservatives who helped elect Mr. Trump.
The Health and Human Services Department, which oversees CMS, declined to comment on the guidance Wednesday.
Pressed by constituents and state officials, lawmakers of both parties and the Trump administration agreed to broaden the scope of a $1.5 billion grant program previously restricted to the opioid crisis, Ricardo writes. Starting this year states can also use those federal dollars to counter addiction to 'stimulants,' a term the government uses for methamphetamine and cocaine.
Trump did inspire LePoulin in one way, indirectly.
I don't think there has been a large outcry, said Bob Holsworth, a former Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist. It's now become more of a policy choice rather than an emotional argument about Obamacare.
There is little doubt that someone like Alexander knew that voting in favor of testimony from former national security adviser Bolton — or even just witnesses, period — would have lined him up for a barrage of Trump criticism. Even as someone set to exit public life, he had to know the coda that might leave on his legacy in a red state like Tennessee and that it would have lasted long past his retirement date in January 2021.
So, you know, I -- obviously, it's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power, but it's within their right and I think that that frees up some great seats for the millions of people who are excited to see this president come to Washington and bring real change.
Emily notes that this new study uses a more objective measure to examine women's financial health, looking at their credit reports instead of self-reported data.
While the leaders of both chambers are largely in sync on policy goals, there are stark differences in their political style. During the campaign, Ryan's support for Trump fluctuated during various imbroglios in which Trump was caught up, while McConnell largely stayed above the fray.

So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am.
The president also risks baring just how little support there is for the more controversial parts of his agenda within his own party. His immigration plan got 39 votes in February. Last summer, when Republicans used a procedural tool to try to repeal Obamacare with just Republican votes, they fell short by one vote. Very few Republicans in Congress are as eager as Trump to spend $25 billion on a brick-and-mortar wall along the border, if that ever came up for a vote.
WALLACE: I have a policy question for you, sir.
I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.
But ultimately, Democrats are preparing to run hard against GOP fiscal policies — in particular, the Republican Party's inevitable general election embrace of a tax plan that delivers a huge windfall to the wealthy — which will happen whether the nominee is Trump, Cruz, or some unicorn savior candidate.
Loren Christian, 43, was smoking an e-cigarette on a bench in the boulevard on Broadway. A stay-at-home mother of two, she summarized Trump's first year in four words: Horrible. Terrifying. Disgusting. Embarrassing.
On Tuesday, Cruz said the aggressive villain Biff Tannen was based on Donald Trump.
The Post's Philip Bump notes this latest revelation means even something we thought we knew — at least in broad strokes — we actually didn't. While no one took the report from Trump's personal physician... terribly seriously… it at least seemed to be an actual analysis from an actual doctor that provided some reassurance that Trump was sufficiently fit to serve as president.
Here, Trump contradicted Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who a day earlier had said: Ultimately, we will see community spread in this country. It's not a question of if but rather a question of when and how many people in this country will have severe illness.
Asked if he had discussed the Mueller investigation with the president or anyone else in the White House, Barr responded: I discussed the Mueller investigation, but not in any particular substance.
This city now has just 700,000 citizens. There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other. Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage. And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.
Hawaii was the first state to ban smoking for people younger than 21. The bill aims to raise the legal minimum age to purchase or possess cigarettes to 30 by next year; 40 by 2021; 50 by 2022; 60 by 2023 and 100 by 2024, Lindsey reports. The timetable would allow the state to plan for a loss in cigarette-tax revenue, according to reports. The bill does not apply to cigars, chewing tobacco or e-cigarettes.

The law was never meant as the final step to giving Americans quality, affordable coverage, but it's taken us a long way, said Leslie Dach, chairman of the Democratic-aligned group Protect Our Care and a former Health and Human Services adviser on the ACA. The law was a dramatic and historic step forward when it was passed, and it is incredibly strong.
Yet the president is pouring on the pressure, yesterday naming Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as the point people on Capitol Hill crafting new health-care legislation, my colleague Colby Itkowitz reports.

QUOTE OF THE DAY: I think that 2019 is going to be the most vitriolic year in American politics since before the Civil War. And I include Vietnam in that. I think we're in for a very nasty 2019. — Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. (USA Today)
Almost all of the Washington cases are in Clark County, an anti-vaccine hot spot where nearly a quarter of kids go to school without immunizations for measles, mumps and rubella.
-- Trump once again lashed out against John McCain, saying he was never a fan of the senator who died last year of brain cancer. John Wagner reports: Trump's comments came during a meeting in the Oval Office with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in response to a reporter's questions about his continuing disparagement of McCain, including in multiple tweets over the weekend. 'I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know,' Trump said, referring to McCain's vote against overhauling the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. 'He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote, and he said thumbs down.' … 'I think that's a disgrace, plus there are other things,' Trump said. 'I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be.'
The vote left the GOP plan to repeal Obamacare in tatters. And yet, for a senator who ran for president as a maverick candidate who wouldn't be bound by party-line votes or political pressure, it seemed fitting. And the visual of McCain's thumbs-down moment will linger as one that defined him — and was perhaps his last major legislative impact, coming just weeks after his devastating glioblastoma diagnosis.
Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.
During a House hearing on gun violence, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) called for the removal of two fathers whose children were killed in last year's mass shooting in Parkland, Fla.:
Dee Mahan, who directs Medicaid initiatives for the advocacy group Families USA, said in an interview that the measure, which is not in the House version of the bill, could allow states to play a shell game with Medicaid money . . . doable on a much larger scale than it was intended for.
The Georgetown researchers found that the rate of children younger than 6 without health insurance climbed from 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.3 percent in 2018. Thirteen states had statistically significant increases in either the rate or number of young kids without insurance. Eleven states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and West Virginia — had significant increases in both.
In the newspaper, Brat said he would hold a town hall sometime after Trump's first 100 days in office. Yet he is planning to travel to Arizona later this month as the special guest of Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) at an event billed as a town hall meeting.
The special counsel also told Trump's lawyers that he is preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice … Mueller reiterated the need to interview Trump — both to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russia investigation and to complete this portion of his probe …

Asked whether the Senate should vote to prevent Trump from holding federal office again, Biden said, per John Wagner . Let the Senate work that out.
He said he was proud of his work at Heritage, citing accomplishments such as the think tank's role in helping lead President Trump's transition team.

The short answer is that it's concerning that news organizations with a clear and stated bias are serving as the eyes and ears of the White House press corps, regardless of their political leaning, said Andrew Seaman, a Reuters reporter who is chair of the Society of Professional Journalists' ethics committee. In a perfect world, only news organizations with editorial independence and proven track records of reliability should be able to provide pool reports for the White House or any other government agency or official.
The war over the ACA is likely to continue until one side or the other wins a decisive electoral victory. That doesn't seem to be on the horizon.
Senate Democrats are pushing for more public health funding.
Sam Hammond, a welfare policy expert at the Niskanen Center, a D.C.-based think tank, said he fears a repeat of the highly publicized problems with healthcare.gov — the website set up under President Barack Obama for people to join the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, which put the broader Obamacare project in political peril.

It's a stump line, we're gonna repeal Obamacare, every word, and then you get the crowd response, he said. I want an America with health care.
The New York Police Department acknowledged in court that the spying program from its Demographics Unit never generated a lead or triggered a terrorism investigation.
But one of the main goals of this lawsuit — and of the broader outpouring of protest and opposition — is to block Trump from escalating this policy and others like it. If Trump so chose, after the 90 days has passed, Trump could extend the ban, and he could even broaden the list of countries targeted by it. There is precedent for this: After 9/11, a national registry for visitors was implemented that started out targeting only a few countries, but then that target list rapidly expanded to include at least two dozen countries, mostly Muslim-majority ones. It's not hard to imagine the same thing happening again — with Trump's executive order expanding into a broad ban on legal immigration from many predominantly Muslim countries — particularly if there were a major terrorist attack.
He may be a good businessman, but he's a liar — and as far as I'm concerned, he's a racist in his words and his actions, Spriggs said.
All this is theoretical until a mainstream Republican candidate actually gets in. Right now the only well-known declared Republican candidate to replace Ryan is Paul Nehlen, a controversial figure who is banned from Twitter for making racially insensitive remarks about Meghan Markle and who describes himself as pro-White. Nehlen lost to Ryan in 2016 by 68 points. Still, any attempts to cast himself as the pro-Trump candidate in the race got a boost when Trump gave him a shout-out in 2016.
Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), another conservative hard-liner, made a similar point: He was making sure that he wasn't taking a position on something that he knows we're disagreeing about.
Former presidential candidate Ted Cruz's campaign looked forward in this video posted online, with a thumbnail image bearing the message To be continued. (Ted Cruz)
AHH: After a nearly four-hour physical exam with 11 specialists, President Trump's doctors said he is in very good health and is expected to stay healthy for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond, our Post colleague Anne Gearan writes.
He did in his good ol' friendly way, Stanley said. He wasn't going to hold anything hostage, like the Senate Democrats did, or use that kind of leverage. He simply was to me, 'How do we get to 'yes'? And I said, 'Governor, you know where I've sat on this for years. I've sat on principle.' 
Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
-- Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway said in an interview with The Bergen Record on Sunday that surveillance attempts from the Obama White House may be broader than even Trump alleged, leveling another remarkable charge against the former commander-in-chief without providing any evidence. What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other, Conway told Kelly. You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets — any number of ways. Conway went on to say that the monitoring could be done with microwaves that turn into cameras, adding: We know this is a fact of modern life.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to hold presidential campaign rally in front of Trump International Hotel:
The Medicare-for-All question is looming over most of the Democrats running for president. In 2017, when many of them endorsed legislation to move toward a single-payer system, Quinnipiac found that 51 percent of voters liked the idea. Eighteen months later, the health insurance industry has highlighted the immediate impact of a Medicare-for-All phase-in — it would shrink their industry as millions of people are moved from the private system to the government system.
Spicer also gave phone numbers to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Remember, the Senate and House committees are supposed to be investigating this themselves. Drain the swamp!
For young men, disproportionately Black, who have been underserved by schools and community resources, and for whom male role models are too often away in prison, it is understandably tempting to fall into selling drugs, as this work requires no previous experience and takes place within the familiarity of the community setting. However, this also sets up too many men for prison or even death, often leaving their children behind.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
KASICH: ... They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.

But Harris is much more careful than Ocasio-Cortez. She does not link it directly to the unemployment rate. She appears to suggest this is an anecdote. We had earlier faulted her for not stating that directly, and now she's added a sentence to make that clearer: Well, you know, I've been traveling our country.
-- Senators expressed a fresh round of frustration that Trump officials are so persistently unwilling to engage with Congress on military decisions. Karoun Demirjian reports: Senators blasted State Department officials for holding a closed-door session when none of the information they shared was classified. … In the weeks since Trump ordered the strike in Baghdad that killed Qasem Soleimani, lawmakers in the House and Senate have rallied around measures to restrain the president's ability to conduct hostilities against Iran absent explicit congressional authorization. … In the weeks since the strike that killed Soleimani, administration officials have given conflicting reasons for why they believed they had legal basis to carry it out absent congressional approval … Administration officials also did not commit to being more forthcoming with Congress, in deference to its war powers, than they have been in the weeks since the Soleimani strike.
The media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason, he said.
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), increasingly vocal in his criticism of Trump, sounded beside himself. Trade wars are never won. Trade wars are lost by both sides, he said in a statement. Make no mistake: If the President goes through with this, it will kill American jobs — that's what every trade war ultimately does. So much losing. With varying degrees of annoyance, other Republicans (for example, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas) joined in the criticism.
KELLY: OK. Senator Rubio, let him answer.
Nicole Ellis explains the step by step process of egg freezing in episode five of The Post's original documentary series: Should I freeze my eggs?:
The resignation of Michael Flynn as Trump's national security adviser — after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contact with the Russian ambassador late last year — has also been an unwelcome distraction for Capitol Hill Republicans. The Senate has decided to probe the matter. McConnell declined to say whether he thinks transcripts of conversations between Flynn and the ambassador should be released.
There has since been some legislation on the meaning of essential, though even with limited precedent there seems to be little more clarity today.
Reconciliation got its start in the 1970s and 1980s, when Congress was reforming how it makes and passes its budget. In those days, Congress would pass a resolution to set targets for revenue and spending — a.k.a. a budget — and a second resolution later in the year that set firm limits on what the government could spend/take in.
Lee was referring to an original group of 13 Republicans who started meeting to discuss an Obamacare overhaul. He expressed disappointment that the group was sidelined as leadership led the bill-writing process, and that they've not even seen text yet even though they're being pressured to vote next week on it.
They also know, as Paul Kane notes, that Republicans will own the result if things go sideways — just as they did for the past seven years. Better to let the GOP take their own crack and pay the price, the logic goes.
* MICHAEL FLYNN, UNDER FIRE: The Post scoops that despite public denials, Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, discussed sanctions against Russia with that country's ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office:
CHUCK TODD: I know, but isn't that Bernie's strength, though? Everybody knows — one thing about Bernie. You know where he stands. …
The report also implies that carriers are able to increase premiums at will and reap unlimited windfalls, Hempstead said. It doesn't mention the rate review process, or the fact that the carriers are constrained by the medical loss ratio.
This is not to deny that the stimulus will have dramatic effects. The funding given to state, local and tribal governments is more than quadruple the budget holes they need to fill until next summer. The Urban Institute estimates that child poverty may be (temporarily) cut in half by measures in the package. And at least some elements of the legislation — particularly the expanded child credit — may be popular enough to become permanent.
In fact, HHS has gotten so bad at responding to requests from Gowdy's committee that it seems like its legislative affairs department has fallen into a state of permanent disrepair, Gowdy wrote, listing six specific examples of information his committee requested from the department to which he didn't receive a full response.
Ryan, then, has a lot of preferences but only one principle. He would prefer, for example, not to increase tariffs, or not to deport undocumented workers who were brought here as children, or not to restrict Muslims from entering the country. But if he had to put up with these things to get the tax cuts he wants, he would. He did. It was this monomaniacal focus on the top tax rate, in other words, that is why Ryan, and the rest of the Republican Party for that matter, were able to reconcile themselves so easily to President Trump. As long as they were getting that from him, they were willing to play their part in his reality show.
-- It goes without saying that the Mueller Reports would be the most hotly anticipated legal documents since the Starr Report in 1998.
KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump, and then we're going to have to go to Governor Kasich.
The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.
--Here are a few more stories from The Post and beyond:
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), an influential member of the tea party-aligned House Freedom Caucus, laid into the proposal, calling it subsidies for unaffordable health care, subsidies for unaffordable premiums, according to The Post's Dave Weigel. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), both libertarian-leaning Republicans, quickly labeled it Obamacare Lite and Obamacare 2.0.
Collins tried to adjourn the hearing before Whitaker was sworn in. Later, he demanded another unsuccessful vote to stop questioning about Whitaker's background.
Three Democrats running for president dropped out of the race between the Feb. 28 South Carolina primary, and Super Tuesday on March 3. (The Washington Post)
My father believed we need to take a long view of history, Dingell wrote in his book. Although the process was long and difficult (and suffered many setbacks, some of which continue to this day), I was blessed by the good Lord to see them both signed into law. So, please listen to me carefully when I say that I know that I won't be here to see if the United States survives this current crisis. A lot of damage has been done to our fragile republic. Repairing that damage won't take months or even years. It will take decades, if not generations, to pull our deeply divided nation together again. … We now find ourselves on the precipice of a great cliff. Our next step is either into the abyss or toward a higher moral ground. It's up to you, my dear friends.

After Romney easily wins the primary, Trump tweets his praise for Romney and his family.
And then Coons had to run back to Tillerson. And now he was running back to Sessions. Coons got off the elevator, and he cut through the cafeteria and pressed the button for another elevator. He was limping a bit because of a weekend injury — I'm not going to talk about it. Old man plus ice, he said — and before he got back to Sessions, he had to stop off and be interviewed by NBC's Andrea Mitchell.
According to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the changes would cost $52.6 billion. Another $6.3 billion under the plan would eliminate reimbursements people with ACA health plans ordinarily would be required to pay if they misjudged how much income they expected to earn in a year — and thus were given larger subsidies than they deserved.
A super PAC that backs President Trump released a spot attacking Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) for his role in ending Ronny L. Jackson's bid to head VA:
During the call, McCarthy offered a selective account of the health-care debates that took place in 2017. When we couldn't pass the repeal of Obamacare the first way through, an amendment came because the Freedom Caucus wouldn't vote for the initial House bill, McCarthy said. That amendment put [the] preexisting condition campaign against us, and so even people who are running for the very first time got attacked on that. And that was the defining issue and the most important issue in the race.
Watch a girl in Florida delight in her first snowfall:
The combined effects of these rules are especially stark in rural areas, where health plans tend to be more expensive, Amy explains. The analysis shows that in almost all of Nebraska, a 60-year-old with a $50,000 income would pay between 30 percent and 50 percent of that income in premiums for the least expensive ACA health plan.
On Sunday, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), the other Muslim congresswoman, went so far as to accuse the Democratic leadership of using people of color to highlight diversity but ignoring them when it mattered — though she did not name Pelosi in the missive.
After The Wall Street Journal story appeared online Sunday evening, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, issued a statement saying it was 'factually inaccurate' to say the military was developing plans to keep nearly 1,000 troops in Syria.
I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on. Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on. But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.
TRUMP: So we're listening to the all-talk, no-action politician, and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.
That prompted a highly unusual rebuke from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who called Schumer's comments dangerous.
Trump is also hoping to add trade success to his list of accomplishments, with plans to work out a potential trade agreement with China in coming weeks.
Some in GOP leadership believe he can be swayed through careful lobbying, including by a fellow Wisconsinite: House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.
Instead of a government handout which ends up serving more like fly paper, which traps somebody in dependency, because if they earn too much they lose their benefit, Republicans are more about a trampoline: How do we get somebody out of the unemployment role into the working role, he said.
The big three insulin makers are also expected on Capitol Hill next week for their own grilling.
By adding Medicare modernization to the list, Trump is now employing the vocabulary of Republicans, notably House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Wilensky said. Ryan has long advocated converting Medicare from an entitlement program and giving its beneficiaries a certain amount of money to help buy private health plans.

Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said he had been slammed over the weekend by constituents angry that the bill had failed: We maybe make a few tweaks and change it, but I still think it's valid. Bring it up. We worked too hard on this.
On Jan. 30, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The Bipartisan Policy Center holds an event on federal funding to combat the opioid crisis on Tuesday.
OOF: Eli Lilly says the price it was paid for a key diabetes treatment actually decreased by 8.1 percent over the last five years, after accounting for rebates and discounts. That's per a report the company released amid mounting pressure over its rising insulin prices.
It's a great example of where the Trump facade begins to fall apart. He's great at bluster and big promises. He can rile people up. But when that's not enough, he can't get things done. He promised a grand health-care plan. Obamacare is still the law of the land. He said he could solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He couldn't. He declared North Korea no longer a threat. It still is.
RUBIO: But he doesn't answer the employment question.
Stephen Colbert shares President Trump's Valentine's Day card to Melania:
The heartbeat bill passed the Iowa House 51 to 46, and passed the state Senate early Wednesday 29 to 17. It awaits a signature from Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has called abortions equivalent to murder. It follows similar heartbeat bills in Mississippi and Kentucky, although federal judges have temporarily blocked those measures.
This is a very important reform and should be pursued. But there is a big risk here of missing people who ought to be receiving benefits, said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
That's really troublesome to me, Barr concluded.
He's the son-in-law of German Khan, who is worth more than $9 billion and is an owner of a Russian bank that figured prominently in the 'dossier' about alleged Russia-Trump collusion, Dana notes. Van der Zwaan also knew that Gates had been in contact during Trump's presidential campaign with a person tied to Russian intelligence services.
Inspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.
This column builds on work by my colleagues Ashley Parker, Matt Viser, and Seung Min Kim, who reported Sunday:
Bloomberg: In '09, I testified and gave a speech before the mayors' conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on. And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare. It was either in the New York Post or the Daily News. So the facts are I was there.
Part of vision is the ability to set out an agenda that is attainable and attractive for an electoral majority. A vision so extreme that it loses half the voters coming out the gate isn't what primary voters should crave.
Rubio said he welcomes the discussion in Congress over paid family leave. He said in a statement:I am committed to seeing this effort through.
and the 1968 Republicans for McCarthy button:
Many prominent Democratic presidential candidates have embraced some version of a Medicare-for-all system, which would allow most Americans to be covered under the federal program.
Hospitals — perhaps not surprisingly — insist it won't. The American Hospital Association, which filed suit in December, says the rule violates hospitals' First Amendment rights and wouldn't help patients make more informed care decisions.
In Maryland and many other states, insurers file their requested premium rates for the upcoming year. Those requests, many of which are due over the next two months, are reviewed and approved by insurance commissioners before being finalized.
Formally launched in 1987, the E.U. program organizes and finances student exchanges across the continent. Its budget for 2014-2020 was nearly $18 billion, and there are plans to raise it to nearly $26 billion for 2021-2027. The program gives 4 million Europeans the opportunity to study, train and live in other member countries.
We should do repeal with a delay, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on CNN Sunday, saying that he was still willing to give the Senate bill another week before declaring it dead.
Spending would decline 6.4 percent if the highest-priced claims were lowered to the 75th percentile price and the lowest-priced claims were raised to the 25th percentile market price.
Senate budget rules allow GOP leaders to scrap nearly every element of the health legislation that passed the House. The only requirement is that the Senate measure must save $133 billion over the current law, the same amount saved in the House bill.
That message has been repeatedly echoed on Fox News by Hegseth, an informal Trump adviser who was discussed at one point as a possible candidate for VA secretary.
OUCH: The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency, a designation it has given to just six other outbreaks. The declaration sets off a global coordination to curb the spread of the virus that has surpassed the number of people infected with the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.
July 19. In an interview with the New York Times, Trump says he has to be sure coverage for preexisting conditions is included: Nothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for preexisting conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it's awfully tough to take it away. … Politically, you can't give it away. So preexisting conditions are a tough deal.
Finally, impeachment has helped Trump raise an enormous war chest. In the last three months of 2019 — the period during which the House conducted its impeachment inquiry — Trump raised $46 million, giving him $102.7 million in the bank. The Senate trial will likely have a similar impact on his fundraising in the first quarter of 2020. Impeachment not only energized Republican voters, it has energized Republican donors.
We have various other things. If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save. The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.
We're looking at maintaining all of the options, Cornyn said. There will be a base bill, but 51 senators will be able to amend it.
While Obamacare was under consideration, McConnell had strong words for the Democratic majority's tactics. Now, he seems to be using them. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)
I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.
Flynn's communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.
Peña was the unnamed doctor in a CNN report who raised concerns inside the White House that Jackson may have violated patient privacy protections for [Mike] Pence's wife and then sought to intimidate the doctor during confrontations over the episode, Josh reports. Peña clashed repeatedly with Jackson, whose nomination to run VA was abandoned amid allegations of liberally prescribing drugs, drinking on the job and creating a hostile workforce, according to a senior White House official, he writes.
Now, his health is yet another political controversy Trump is facing. Trump and his White House have only compounded the confusion by insisting on near-secrecy about the president's health and refusing to answer basic questions that predecessors have commonly addressed, The Post's Ashley Parker and Lenny Bernstein report. The irony is also not lost on the president's detractors that Trump — who at 70 become the oldest person elected president and who repeatedly attacked Hillary Clinton's health and 'stamina' during the 2016 campaign — may have misled the American public about his own physical well-being.
We suggest the agencies focus on two issues: First, the market impact in the pharmaceutical industry of a merge that will further consolidate the industry to the detriment of competition, Reps. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) wrote to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, and second, the likelihood that the $74 billion merger will significantly increase the prices consumers, taxpayers, and employers will be required to pay for prescription drugs after the merger, not for better medications, but to finance the merger itself.
TRUMP: Take a look -- excuse me. You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...
The conference itself was as divisive as Democrats could have feared. A short guide:
There was no indication that there would be any further Freedom Caucus defections — nor evidence that the moderates who abandoned the bill could be wooed back.
Republicans vowed to eliminate all the Obamacare taxes — but not the healthy insurance subsidies for working families that those taxes were meant to pay for.
Some of the president's historical references don't pass a quick fact check. Here are some times he's gotten it wrong. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)
Republicans have seized on the Mercatus study to discredit single-payer, citing its high estimates of government costs. The idea has gained increasing traction among Democratic lawmakers over the past year, winning the backing of several of its likely presidential contenders such as Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
Society perceives me and people like me as people who bring death, the 35-year-old donor Nina Martinez told Lenny in an interview before the operation. And I can't figure out any better way to show that people like me can bring life.
I'm trying to focus in Energy and Commerce mostly on things we think we can get done in this two-year session, Pallone said. Most of our focus is stabilizing the Affordable Care Act because of all the sabotage by the Trump administration.
Create at least 25 million jobs and be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. (About 6.5 million jobs were created in Trump's first three years, before the coronavirus pandemic set in. Even ignoring the losses since then, that wouldn't have been on pace for 25 million jobs even if Trump had served eight years.)
The Democratic-majority House may vote later today to pass the resolution, which calls the Justice Department's position an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people, as way of putting Republicans on the hook for either supporting or opposing a Trump administration decision many of them privately disagree with.
Democrats are poised to pass HR1, a sweeping voter access bill, today.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and an outspoken critic of refundable tax credits, said Trump's remarks did not constitute an endorsement of the Ryan plan.
In June, I commuted Alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
* TRUMP'S DUMB PLAN TO MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR THE WALL: White House press secretary Sean Spicer has floated a tax on imported goods to fund Trump's border wall. Paul Krugman explains why this won't actually fulfill Trump's vow to make Mexico pay for it, and adds:
His announcement seems to indicate that the end of this trial is close. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is still weighing her decision. Sens Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) have indicated they will vote for witnesses. But Democrats very likely need a fourth vote — unless Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. elects to break a potential 50-50 tie.
Democrats on many or most votes will need both Sinema and Manchin, given the 50-50 Senate and early indications that Republicans will be pretty or completely united on things like the coronavirus relief package.
Tuesday had the potential to be another jaw-dropping day on Capitol Hill, until Nunes intervened to help out Trump. He had invited top Obama national security officials — such as former director of national intelligence James Clapper, former CIA director John Brennan and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates — to testify in a rare public hearing. Then he abruptly canceled it.
But Republicans from the other side of the party spectrum are also distancing themselves from the Senate bill, as Democrats suggest they are ready for a bipartisan approach.
Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in health care, said the Vermont senator.
Mueller's investigators have indicated to the president's legal team that they are considering writing reports on their findings in stages — with the first report focused on the obstruction issue, per Carol and Bob. Under special counsel regulations, Mueller is required to report his conclusions confidentially to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who has the authority to decide whether to release the information publicly. 'They've said they want to write a report on this — to answer the public's questions — and they need the president's interview as the last step,' one person familiar with the discussions said of Mueller's team.
Six weeks later, Kreidler got a response back from HHS. But the agency didn't reply to his concerns about the individual mandate to buy coverage, or the cost-sharing subsidies.
• Stop spending on the U.S.-Mexico border wall and direct funds instead toward higher-tech border enforcement.
Congress and the administration, as well as the states, have spent weeks grappling with how the uninsured will get treatment amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for the government to provide not only free coronavirus testing but also treatment for the uninsured.
But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement: Tonight, we heard the president make inaccurate and deliberately misleading claims about safe, legal abortion and bills that are meant to protect women's access if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned — something that is increasingly likely.
10:35 a.m.: Barr confirms he spoke with White House officials about Mueller — but, for now, doesn't get a chance to offer details
Mob boss sees an old lady struggling to cross the street, sends off one of his thugs to offer to help. Thug walks over, shoots the lady dead. He comes back and says: Well, I offed her, boss, but I'm not sure it helped. (Jon Ketzner, Cumberland, Md.)
God, you're blowing my mind, Baldwin-as-Trump says. Keep eating that finger chili!
Nobody knows all this better than Tom Davis, the former Republican House member from Northern Virginia who served in the House for seven terms before leaving Congress in 2008. With thousands of federal employees in his district, Davis and a few other members tried repeatedly to pass legislation that would forever avoid government shutdowns. When Congress failed to reach agreement on spending by the time the clock ran out, Davis's proposal would have triggered a default spending law to keep the government up and running, an automatic continuing resolution. (A similar proposal was introduced in this session of Congress by Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lloyd Smucker.) Several states have such laws.
I moved here from somewhere else, Dana Phillips, who lives in Aiken, S.C., told the Post and Courier. If I had known before I moved here that this is the man who stood up in Washington, D.C., and yelled at our former president, I would not have moved here.
This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity: They say one thing, and they do another, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said of Republicans.
Finding Clinton voters at each stop was trivial, as you'd expect, but the similarity of the complaints — regardless of race, gender or socioeconomic status — was remarkable. Trump's policy positions were consistently critiqued — immigration and the tax bill in particular — but his temperament and personality (and his perceived biases) were often mentioned first and more forcefully.
This whole effort stems from Republicans' enduring opposition to regulations imposed upon insurers under the ACA, which among other things require them to cover ten categories of care to ensure consumers on the individual market can access a full range of benefits.
There's a lot of wisdom in scrapping it, Beto O'Rourke said last night in Pennsylvania.
The rulings in rapid succession, both by judges appointed by Barack Obama, are the latest legal twists in a dispute over an expansion of health benefits for women under the Affordable Care Act that has wound through the courts for years, Amy writes.
2. Get a deal ending automatic spending cuts: Complicating already-complicated budget negotiations are strict caps on how much Congress can spend each year on domestic and defense spending, a requirement from a 2011 budget deal.
PROGRAMMING NOTE: The Health 202 will not publish on Monday, Jan. 15, for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. We'll be back in your inbox on Tuesday.
Trump apparently was not listening to his own news conference. He made this remark moments after Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that the degree of risk has the potential to change quickly. And we can expect to see more cases in the United States. Within three days, 12 more cases were identified in the United States, and one person had died. Within five days, there were more than 100 confirmed U.S. cases, and six people had died. Two weeks later, there were 1,000 cases and 28 deaths.
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.
-- Trump got a standing ovation for his antiabortion comments during yesterday's National Prayer Breakfast, per Anne Gearan. Trump was a supporter of abortion rights until he decided he wanted to run for president as a Republican.
Was it a mortal blow? Never count out anyone who has billions of dollars to burn. But Bloomberg's disastrous debate performance capped a catastrophic week in which his effort to claim the electability lane was severely damaged.
Conservative constitutional attorney Chuck Cooper said Republicans are wrong to assert it's unconstitutional for a former president to be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors. A vote by the Senate to disqualify can be taken only after the officer has been removed and is by definition a former officer, Cooper A vote by the Senate to disqualify can be taken only after the officer has been removed and is by definition a former officer, Cooper said in a WSJ op-ed. Given that the Constitution permits the Senate to impose the penalty of permanent disqualification only on former officeholders, it defies logic to suggest that the Senate is prohibited from trying and convicting former officeholders.
OOF: Grindr, a popular dating app for gay men, said yesterday it will stop sharing users' HIV data with third-party companies that analyze mobile and Web apps, The Post's Kristine Phillips reports. BuzzFeed had reported Monday that Grindr, which has 3.6 million daily active users worldwide, has been providing their HIV status and last tested date to two analytics companies, prompting a backlash of criticism that the app breached users' trust.
On Friday, the committee passed essentially the same House budget that died in March — but with a handful of amendments meant to make expansion more palatable to the Senate. Two Republicans in that chamber have said they would team up with Democrats on Medicaid under certain conditions.
Republicans are seizing the chance to portray Democrats as radical and out of touch with mainstream Americans, pointing to comments like Sen. Kamala Harris's (D-Calif.) support for ending private insurance in the pursuit of Medicare-for-all.
As a congressman, Inslee was a key player in the push for a cap-and-trade system 10 years ago. A bill passed in the House but stalled in the Senate, even though Democrats had a near-filibuster-proof majority.
Several weeks ago, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) responded to his town hall criticism in kind, calling out one attendee for asking a garbage question and railing against others for not accepting President Trump's win.
A tax code overhaul to treat investment income as earned income to help pay for free community college.
The point is we need money right now for border security, including barriers and walls and slats and other things, Barr retorted.
The emergency response bill provides workers at small and midsize companies with two weeks of paid sick leave for the rest of the year.
Trump himself has broken away from coronavirus messaging to tout the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which received a key approval from Interior in late January and began construction this month.
Both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines must be used within six hours of being removed from subzero storage and reaching room temperature. Workers frequently have a few doses left over at the end of the day if people scheduled to receive the vaccine don't show up, or if they open a package of five or 10 vials but don't use them all. Because workers don't want to waste any of the precious vaccine, some people have been able to get a serendipitous shot ahead of when they might otherwise be in line for the dose, The Post's Lenny Bernstein and Lola Fadulu report.
Price said his remarks were taken out of context. Repealing the individual mandate was exactly the right thing to do. Forcing Americans to buy something they don't want undermines individual liberty as well as free markets, Price said in a statement through the Job Creators Network, Politico's Rachana Pradhan reports. The only fair and effective way to bring down healthcare costs is to allow markets to create more choices for consumers and small businesses.
There is more wiggle room on the high side — it could make up for price increases on the lower side, said Kevin Kennedy, one of the study researchers.
New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after four women accused him of physical abuse:
But Saccone's retail and TV ad campaigning was resoundingly positive, clashing with the negative ads that Republicans threw across the airwaves. Four groups spent more than $1 million: the National Republican Congressional Committee ($3.5 million), the Congressional Leadership Fund ($3.4 million), the Republican National Committee ($1.3 million) and America First Action ($1.1 million).
Ending the individual mandate could be the most damaging thing Trump and Republicans have done to Obamacare, but it's hard to know for sure, Rivlin said. It depends how many people decide not to get health insurance next year because they don't have to.
Trump is depicted as presiding over a chaotic White House, struggling to settle into his new reality and eagerly trying to maintain his normal golf habits.
Just a few months ago, Cotton appeared to be poised for his own presidential run. He was in Iowa four weeks before November's election — a time when many Republicans were losing hope that Trump could win and were looking ahead to 2020.
Indeed, as the president directed, and the secretary of labor confirmed, the final rule was designed to expand access to AHPs to avoid the most stringent requirements of the ACA, wrote Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush.
Of the dozens of patient advocacy groups that have recently been part of national advertising campaigns pushing back against the Trump administration's proposed Medicare changes, about half of the groups received money from drugmakers. More than $58 million went to the groups in 2015, Kaiser Health News's Sydney Lupkin, Elizabeth Lucas and Victoria Knight report, citing data from financial disclosures in its Pre$cription for Power database.
Trump's statement came after Bannon's lengthy and unvarnished interviews with author Michael Wolff, whose new book is the talk of the town — in which he torched Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, among other juicy quotes (see Wolff's lengthy New York excerpt here). Trump was infuriated at Bannon's comments, even telling senior aides and advisers that Bannon was 'not well,'  The Post's Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker report. He complained that Bannon again was trying to take credit for his election win.
Your bare-bottom sprinting don't mean you got game.
Standing up to these pharmaceutical corporations and delivering real price transparency and accountability for Virginians are going to take big, bold leadership. But mark my words: We're going to get it done, and Virginia will lead the nation in putting our citizens first.
More recently, Pence has asserted the average premium cost today is nearly $3,000 a year more for Americans than it was in 2013. Why the $2,000 decrease? He's now citing an HHS report that claimed Obamacare premiums have increased 105 percent from 2013 to 2017. But there are problems with that report.
Nonetheless, two top Democrats -- Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member om the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions panel, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking member of the Finance Committee -- will not be among the Democrats voting for Azar today. In a floor speech provided in advance to The Health 202, Murray plans to criticize Azar for a number of items, including supporting ACA repeal efforts, not backing more opioid funding (at least publicly) and the increase in insulin prices at Lilly while Azar was working there.
She recharged me with first degree murder, never looked into the facts of the case. Never looked into the misconduct that had taken place, Myon Burrell told ABC News. He was convicted for the 2002 first-degree murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards. Recently, an AP investigation has cast doubt over the murder investigation and the police tactics used. Klobuchar, Burrell said, never even addressed the misconduct that had taken place and still put the same detective, the same police on my case to go and get more bogus evidence. In a statement to ABC, Klobuchar once again called for a review of the case.
--A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
Gottlieb told Laurie he plans to write about FDA-related issues in his new gig. But he stressed he doesn't want to be on the sidelines causing grief for Ned Sharpless, the National Cancer Institute director who will become acting commissioner.
Republican lawmakers say Trump's muddled messaging during his Tuesday night visit to the Capitol hurt efforts to whip votes: The president didn't say which particular bill he wanted and danced on the political grave of Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), whose challenger the president endorsed but who is well-liked by colleagues. I think the president needs to understand that that may have actually lost him votes in that meeting, said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho). The reason he was there was to emphasize that he had our backs, and I think a different message was sent.
Biden would reshape how America powers itself in the name of fighting global warming, an epic conversion requiring a $2 trillion down payment over his four-year term. It would surely be a heavy lift to get through Congress, even if he argues that it's a good way to stimulate the economy. Biden's climate agenda drives his approach to energy issues. He has vowed to ban new oil and gas permits on public land and water. Many planned oil, gas and mining ventures -- even those on private land -- face heightened risk of rejection or longer approval times.
To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people.
Fifty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) spoke about his legacy and the work left to do:
Repercussions from the Soleimani killing are not over by a long shot. Hawks who are crowing about how deterrence works ignore the fact that the Iranian regime can be both patient and strategic. Trump has been talked into sending 18,000 more troops to the Middle East since last spring — creating a target-rich environment for Iran's proxy forces, should the decision be made to stage some kind of attack.
The optical pulse sensor on Apple's watch picks up heart rates, and researchers explored whether that tool could detect irregular heartbeats known as atrial fibrillation, a condition that can increase one's risk for stroke, Peter writes. For those involved in the study, if the watch detected suspected atrial fibrillation, users could consult with a doctor, who could advise the patients to get immediate treatment or would send electrocardiogram patches to help confirm whether the users actually had atrial fibrillation.
Partisanship encourages intense animosity against partisan opponents, as a great deal of research shows. But partisan conflict can also increase anger at fellow party members who don't toe the line.
No, Cornyn answered. Presidents always leverage foreign aid, particularly here, where there's concerns about corruption. … We basically know what the facts are. That's what the House managers said: They said the facts are uncontested.
SPICER: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We're now 72 hours out from the inauguration -- three days for those who are math-challenged.
Unless a more mainstream candidate emerges in the early voting states to challenge the two towers of Trump and Cruz — which, remember, is still a live possibility — we're left with worse and bad.
It is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain, CNN said in a statement. His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.
While House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) is encouraging factions from the GOP's moderate and conservative wings to negotiate a possible health-care compromise, several individuals briefed on the leadership's plans said there is no immediate interest in bringing a revised bill up for a House vote.
And the House Ways and Means Committee proposes expanding Obamacare subsidies and making COBRA coverage more affordable for people who have recently been laid off. Its legislation would:
The bottom line is that all of the incentives are lined up for the manufacturers to set higher and higher prices, Verma said in a speech to the American Hospital Association.
As you know, Kellyanne, myself, Jason, Hope (ph), others on the campaign were peppered (ph) with questions regarding people who would quote/unquote support Donald Trump and asking us whether or not (inaudible) this individual or that individual relentlessly. I hope that you on the call relentlessly ask the leaders in the Democratic Party, the Senate leadership, Chuck Schumer, other members of the Senate, whether or not they equally denounce these left-wing tactics by Code Pink and other groups to disrupt the democratic process.
The problem with our political debates is that they have become too much about means and not enough about ends, too much about economic values and too little about moral ones, too much about individual rights and not enough about collective responsibility.
The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.
Biden declined to say whether Trump should lose his political rights as he returned from Delaware this morning.
If the courts were to overturn the ACA, around 20 million Americans would lose their health coverage, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy think tank. The coverage gains were chiefly through the offer of private subsidized plans in state-based marketplaces and through the expansion of Medicaid in many states to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.
The overwhelming reaction that I'm receiving is that the president talked about security in so many different ways, and he totally ignored the gun violence epidemic in our country, she told reporters after the address, Roll Call's Katherine Tully-McManus reports.
End catch-and-release. Anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed from the country. (This was still happening as of 2018, although the administration announced its official end in 2019, including implementing policies that led among other things to separating families.)
Facebook is in the early stages of figuring out how it can make accurate vaccination information available to its users. In the meantime, Facebook sees factually accurate counter-speech by users as a possible safeguard, Taylor writes.
The discounts come in the form of back-ended rebates in many cases that don't directly benefit the patient, the commissioner, who announced his resignation this week, said at an event hosted by the Hill. The patients who are spending the money and using the drugs and who are sick and out of pocket don't see the rebates directly … The rebates are used to lower the price for everyone within a plan, so they're benefiting patients in the end, but they're not benefiting the patient who's sick and out of pocket.
9:33 a.m.: The hearing is underway
-- A growing number of Republican senators are pointing to Trump's threat to invoke executive privilege as an excuse to vote against even trying to call witnesses, CNN reports: GOP senators are privately and publicly raising concerns that issuing subpoenas -- to top officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton and for documents blocked by the White House -- will only serve to drag out the proceedings. Plus, many say there's little appetite for such a time-consuming fight, given that legal battles may ultimately not be successful and could force the courts to rule on hugely consequential constitutional issues about the separation of powers between the branches of government.
— House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reportedly bluntly criticized Trump's plan to dole out $500 million in funding for childhood cancer research, saying it's not nearly enough.
Sanders: Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) issued a statement praising the decision.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the budget shows Republicans want to make Medicare wither on the vine. House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said it's unbelievable that the Trump budget calls for … $850 billion cuts to Medicare.
—Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), one of three senators Trump had named as working on an Obamacare replacement bill, appeared to toss the onus for a replacement bill back onto the White House.
The House passed an $8.3 billion package, as the U.S. death toll reached 11.
I'll say he's crazy, Keishawn added.
-- Over three hours on Saturday, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) continued to distance himself from Trump. After barely winning reelection in his suburban San Diego district because of backlash against Trump, he declared in his opening statement at a community meeting: I do not work for the executive branch. I investigated the Obama administration. I also investigated the Bush administration. Later, he said: I'm going to be with Trump sometimes, against him sometimes. Tony Perry, who was in Oceanside for us, notes that no one asked Issa about local issues, not even about a recent deployment of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton to Syria: That suggests that the electorate is primed to turn the 2018 election into a referendum on Trump.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a markup on legislation to combat the opioid crisis.
Then there's the Environmental Protection Agency, now run by a climate denier who made his career suing to stop environmental regulations from being enforced. One of Congress's first acts this year was to undo an Obama administration rule limiting the amount of coal ash that could be dumped in streams. If you live in the wrong area and you're fond of clean water? You're on your own. That's just a small part of the comprehensive assault on environmental and climate change regulation we're going to see.
But while individual public health experts, including Fauci and former CDC director Tom Frieden, are calling for an upgrade in masking, the federal government has not made it an official recommendation. The CDC continues to recommend that people avoid surgical masks and other face coverings meant for health-care workers.
These price levers are harder for the U.S. government to come by because of the point outlined earlier: Our health insurance system is a lot more fragmented. Only about one-third of Americans are on some form of government-sponsored insurance. And the U.S. government has traditionally played a much smaller role in regulating private industry overall.

Gallup polling has also shown that the public is at odds with Trump over the border wall and strongly favors allowing beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to remain in the United States and have a path to citizenship.
It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world … listening to the stupid s‑‑‑ we have to deal with in this country, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase, said in an unguarded moment last week. Dimon was quick to add, reflexively, that it wasn't a Republican or a Democratic issue, but he knows better than that. Republicans were handed a golden opportunity to govern and they have blown it. This one is on them.
So Sanders certainly has the most accurate sound bite. But it's lacking important context, making it misleading.
The White House has resumed regular coronavirus press briefings.
If you think Obama focusing on health care during the recession was a misalignment of priorities, that is nothing compared to opening America's borders and shutting down enforcement during an economically ravaging pandemic, Miller said in an interview. From a purely political standpoint, this is a recipe for Democrats to have an historic drubbing in the midterms if we can make it even as big an issue or bigger than Obamacare.
It appeals on a political basis to people who hear this slogan and, without understanding the financial aspects of this, say, 'Yeah, that,'  Antos said.
There is no guarantee that Medicaid expansion — a goal that eluded Northam's Democratic predecessor, Terry McAuliffe — will happen.
And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.
The problem we're having, Mr. Speaker, is — well — elections have consequences, Davis said.
Biden: I'm ready to lead this country because I think it's important we restore the soul of this nation. This president has ripped it out.
She also pressed him about the June 2018 memo he wrote to Justice Department officials criticizing what he believed was Mueller's legal theory of how the president may have obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017.
Trump has also used the coronavirus task force briefings to showcase his administration's efforts to combat drug cartels in Central America, to call for new tax deductions for corporations and to push for nationwide voter-ID laws. He has also called for a $2 trillion infrastructure package.
Ryan and Price spent Wednesday morning talking directly with skeptics of the House approach. Several members said they met directly with Price to discuss the administration's position on key elements like the refundable tax credits and the fate of the ACA's Medicaid expansion.
Tanden is a loyal and, yes, sometimes combative Democrat, but she cares far more about policy than politics. And she knows and admires Republicans who feel the same way.
It is not a large amount but would not go unnoticed by seniors on fixed incomes, Chris writes. It would also give Democrats an opening to slam Trump as insensitive to the elderly in places like Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin — states that Trump must win to regain the White House.

Witnesses described seeing a woman shooting a gun in the courtyard as others ran for their lives. … San Francisco General Hospital spokesman Brent Andrew said a 36-year-old man was in critical condition, while two women were being treated for injuries. One of the women was in critical condition, while the other was in fair condition ...
All the other senators officially seeking the Democratic presidential nomination — Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and, most recently, Sanders of Vermont — have co-sponsored Medicare-for-all as envisioned in a bill introduced by Sanders in 2017. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, also a 2020 contender, has signed on to a similar bill in the House.
As for congressional Republicans, they're publicly admitting they've pretty much moved on from Obamacare and any effort to improve, weaken or otherwise change it.
(On Friday, the Democrat-led states who are defending the ACA in that lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to consider the case during its current term, hoping to get a final ruling on the law this year.)
Some Republicans want to move on so that Congress can focus on pressing deadlines in the late summer and early autumn, including a vote to increase the federal borrowing limit that could come as early as mid-July. Republicans have also suggested that they want to begin negotiations with Democrats on a long-term spending bill before Sept. 30, when the fiscal year ends, and take up tax reform, another sweeping GOP legislative goal.
What we need is to expand coverage so that people can have a choice for a public option, and that's a start, all right? she told a questioner at the town hall. You could do it many ways, but you could also do it with Medicaid, something I don't think we're talking about enough as a potential solution.
At Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Montgomery County, Erika Dickstein of Bethesda said she voted for Van Hollen. She said she hated voting against a woman but thought Van Hollen had been effective in the House.
Now he's President, and he needs support beyond the Breitbart cheering section that will excuse anything … Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump's approval rating at 39 percent. No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn't show more respect for the truth most Americans may conclude he's a fake President.
The administration has branded the initiative Healthy Adult Opportunity, billing it as a way for states to run Medicaid as they see fit and ensure the program prioritizes care for the most vulnerable, such as children, pregnant women or the disabled.
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said the House should move quickly on passing its bill. I'm not going to tell them what to do, but I am going to say that if they don't move pretty quickly, we ought to see what we can do in the United States Senate, Grassley said.

Herring often said OAN's purpose was to give viewers the news they needed to make educated choices. But he increasingly directed the newsroom to cover stories that reflected his personal views, employees said. For example, producers said, Herring ordered that OAN minimize coverage of Pope Francis's U.S. visit in 2015 because the pope had urged comprehensive action against climate change.
Whatever bug had been circulating in the GOP — whether it was TDS or an attack of conscience — seemed to have mostly cleared up by the time the impeachment trial rolled around. McCarthy backtracked by expanding the list of those who bear responsibility for Jan. 6 to everyone across this country. McConnell voted against holding an impeachment trial in the Senate on the basis that it was unconstitutional since Trump was no longer president.
It would be troubling if any president did a quid pro quo with tax dollars, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said on Oct. 23 after then-acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified, but so far we don't have evidence that's happened.
Trump, during the 2016 campaign, promised voters that he wouldn't touch Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid if he became president, effectively undermining Ryan's long-held goals. Since taking office, Trump has agreed to try to cut spending on Medicaid and Social Security disability, but even those efforts have failed in a divided Congress.
O'Rourke and Booker break into Spanish: Besides Booker, two Democratic candidates spoke Spanish, a way to signal their understanding of, and sympathy for, immigrants at a moment when passions on immigration have been inflamed.

Victim mentality is not cool. I don't know why people like being oppressed. … 'We're oppressed! Four-hundred years of slavery! Jim Crow!' By the way, none of you guys lived through [that]. … Your grandparents did, and it's embarrassing that you utilize their history. You're not living through anything right now.
Majorities of Americans support expanding tax credits to make health plans on the ACA marketplace more affordable.
At least he was saying things that were resonating with people, she said. For example, bringing jobs to the U.S., bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Stop being interventionist.
For legions of former administration officials who found themselves in Dingell's crosshairs during his 59 years in the House, however, he will always be most closely associated with vigorous oversight of the executive branch.
-- Prime Minister Theresa May conceded that she now must ask E.U. leaders to delay Brexit for three months — because the Parliament has failed to pass her unloved deal for departure. William Booth and Michael Birnbaum report: Standing in Parliament on Wednesday, May blamed lawmakers for the impasse, acknowledging that the House of Commons has twice rejected the withdrawal agreement that May spent two years negotiating with her European counterparts. May said she would seek a short extension, just three months until June 30. If the delay were longer, Britain as a member of the European Union would have to participate in elections for the European parliament. Also, a longer delay, May warned, would provide 'endless hours and days of this House carrying on, contemplating its navel on Europe.'
The only Democratic-led state that has not expanded its Medi­caid program is Virginia, where Gov. Terry McAuliffe has been unable to overcome the resistance of the GOP-controlled legislature.
-- Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards writes in her new memoir that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump offered the organization increased federal funding if it stopped providing abortions. She writes in Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead, If it wasn't crystal clear before, it was now. Jared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win. … In their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers. It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women's rights for more money. (People)
In many of these places, it is hard for people at risk of contracting HIV to find the medication critical to protecting them from the virus and ending the 38-year-old epidemic. The CDC estimates that the decline in HIV infections has stalled because effective prevention and treatment are not reaching those who could most benefit.
It does Sanders no good to protest that his zero-co-pay, free-dental, free-vision, free-everything plan beats even the most generous union deal. Indeed, it's the only conceivable version of health insurance guaranteed to beat every existing one. So what if it bears little resemblance to insurance systems abroad upon which Sanders supposedly modeled it?
How many of you all are parents like me? So if you're a parent and you're looking up saying what, college costs what a year? You know, we're looking at what, if you have two kids, you're looking at half a million dollars in tuition for many of these schools. And parents feel like they have no choice but to pay. So then what does the government do? The government says we'll give you loans. So you're up to $1.6 trillion dollars in student loan debt and counting. And the underemployment rate for recent college graduates is 40 to 44 percent.
But the lower courts have kept the Affordable Care Act in place as appeals continue, and a practical effect of the Supreme Court's action is that it will stay that way at least through the November elections. Democrats have made health care and defense of Obamacare a key point in the campaign.
We should've taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn't have ISIS. And we would have had wealth.

I would like you to be prepared to discuss how DOJ recusal and conflict of interest policies can be effective if nominees like you, or appointees like (acting attorney general Matthew) Whitaker fail to disclose anonymous payments, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote in a letter to Barr last week.
Gallup has released some new polling today that reminds us of the degree to which the American public sides with Democrats on this issue:
Last June, the House passed a significant expansion to the ACA. They knew it wouldn't go anywhere under President Trump, but the measure laid down a marker for the direction Democratic leaders would like to move on the issue in the future.
OOF: The World Trade Organization is meeting this week to consider suspending coronavirus vaccine patents.
He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
Trump — who relished his ability on the campaign trail to capture the public imagination and use his bully pulpit — more frequently plays the role of partisan cheerleader or frustrated onlooker from the White House. Executive actions, foreign policy flare-ups and the probes into Russian election interference have commanded much more of his time.
Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.
These 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.
Sanders, one of a growing number of Democratic candidates for president, was the first to introduce a Medicare-for-all bill, back in 2017. Many now-presidential contenders, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have signed onto the legislation.
Under the arrangement, Merck will dedicate two facilities in the United States to Johnson & Johnson's shots, Laurie and Chris write. One will provide 'fill-finish' services, the last stage of the production process during which the vaccine substance is placed in vials and packaged for distribution. The other will make the vaccine itself, and has the potential to vastly increase supply, perhaps even doubling what Johnson & Johnson could make on its own.
Barr vowed Tuesday that he would not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong — not by the media, or Congress, or, critically, the president.
We need a politics that's about decency, a politics that brings back dignity. That's what Joe Biden has been practicing his entire life, Buttigieg said at an event ahead of Biden's rally.
She has slipped dramatically in polls since last year, and hasn't matched others in small-donor fundraising, one indication of enthusiasm. And the Native American story just won't go away. During this interview with CNN's David Axelrod, Warren explains why she listed her ethnicity on her bar application:
It's a great question and very important — health care, he said. And I think it's probably the thing that I'm most disappointed that I haven't been able to say what a good job we've done. I haven't been able to sell what a great job we've done.
At the heart of the problem is the stark divide between liberal Democratic primary voters and white working-class swing voters when it comes to the security issues around immigration.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't —- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
The board of the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday ousted president Jim DeMint after days of turmoil and internal debate, blaming him for management and communication problems that have roiled the venerable conservative think tank.
Listen to the podcast to hear Metzl talk more fully about what happened in each state and the role race played there. And listen to what he has to say about white-identity politics, President Trump's role in driving it and what can be done to push against it. White America has not often had to define itself because it's the invisible norm or the control group, but right now, if you don't agree with the model of whiteness that President Trump is articulating it's incumbent to articulate a different model of whiteness, Metzl said. For him, that means taking a step back to create a better formulation that's more horizontal and distributive that works better for everybody, including white Americans.
As the vote-counting effort intensifies, Trump, who has said he supports the bill but it needs more negotiation, is trying to build consensus both in public and behind the scenes. On Thursday, he called Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), one of the five GOP holdouts, to speak with him about his proposed changes, according to White House officials and a Trump ally with knowledge of the conversation.

POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES: Trump's budget might be dead on arrival, per most Hill sources who texted me about it, but the president's proposal to slash Medicare has political implications ahead of 2020.
Big business was a stabilizing force, a moderating influence in Washington, said Steve Odland, president of the Committee on Economic Development and a former chief executive of Office Depot and Auto Zone. They were the adults in the room.
Abortion rights groups say the decision sets a dangerous precedent at a time when the idea of granting legal rights to a fetus has gained traction in state legislatures as well as in courts.
The lawsuit, filed by the state attorney general Letitia James, is one of the very few in a wave of opioid litigation across the country that name the Sacklers, the New York Times's Roni Caryn Rabin reports. It targets eight family members: Richard, Jonathan, Mortimer, Kathe, David, Beverly and Theresa Sackler, as well as Ilene Sackler Lefcourt.
The work requirements are controversial enough without adding the money for association-style health plans. But Republicans appear to be be complementing President Trump's move to allow the expansion of insurance coverage with fewer rules as the administration inches away from regulations laid out under the Affordable Care Act.
Now Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) are leading an effort to reintroduce legislation that would eliminate the rules. The lawmakers urge Biden to support the bill, citing his previous statements in support of medication-assisted treatment.

Yang, a 44-year-old start-up veteran who had never run for anything until becoming a presidential candidate, has attracted a sizable online following, one that alternately thrills and baffles him. This month, he said that more than 65,000 people had donated to his campaign, which guarantees him a spot in the first primary debate — something that can't yet be said for more-established politicians such as former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper or Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the decision on whether to charge for coronavirus testing will be made by the states. People without insurance can receive care at community health centers at a reduced cost or free, the spokesperson said.
Even if the Senate measure does pass the upper chamber, it will still have to pass muster with the more conservative House before any legislation could be enacted.
Adam's ordinarily not that stupid, but when you tell the jury, the Senate, on one day that they're corrupt, and then you tell the American people they cannot be trusted to pick the commander in chief, that's just a wildly stupid trial strategy, former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told Bret Baier.
Rudy Giuliani: No, I MEANT to hold this press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping.
Is there anywhere else I can get work?
Certainly it complicated things, Toomey said.
To the contrary, as the latest Quinnipiac poll shows, American voters say 55 - 32 percent they would prefer to improve rather than replace the health care system in the U.S. No listed group prefers replacing the health care system. That includes 60 percent of Democrats. A public option gets support from 61 percent of Democrats and 51 percent overall. (While putting everyone in Medicare gets even higher support from Democrats and more than 40 percent of all voters' support, poll after poll shows support nose-dives when it is explained that all private insurance would disappear.)
During a lunch with reporters on Friday hosted by Winning for Women, a GOP group dedicated to promoting female candidates and politicians, Ernst said GOP upsets in the Hawkeye State last year — Democratic challengers Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer unseated then-Reps. David Young (R-Iowa) and Rod Blum (R-Iowa) in November — were the result of voters concerned about the GOP push to eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions by rolling back the Affordable Care Act. Young and Blum were forced to defend their 2017 votes to repeal and replace Obamacare.
It's gotta go, Pete Buttigieg said in a Q&A with liberal blogger Greg Sargent that published yesterday morning.
CRUZ: So I'd like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008? It wasn't for business. And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president?
Along with the travel shows, Wealth TV aired a few short newscasts. My father is a news junkie, and we saw that the 30-minute newscasts we had on Wealth TV were actually generating an audience, Charles said. We looked at MSNBC and Fox and I kept thinking that Rachel Maddow and Bill O'Reilly had the same format — one person spending an hour beating three or four subjects to death. CNN was moving in the same direction, away from hard news. There was a lane for us to hit the news down the center and lean right.
Children younger than 6 had a higher uninsured rate in 2018 than children 6 to 18 in seven states: Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wyoming.
Less than a day in 2018–2019
After some predictable boasting and chest-thumping, Trump laid out what he wants: an end to Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon, in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. But that happens to be precisely what Obama had already achieved, with the comprehensive and highly effective nuclear deal that Trump pulled the United States out of.
— First in The Health 202: A coalition of health-care industry groups called Partnership for America's Health Care Future is sending a letter to congressional leaders urging them to quash that bill and any other Medicare-for-All-like efforts.
Another fault line is what to do with Medicaid, the government's health program for low-income Americans that was expanded to 11 million people as part of Obamacare.
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
KASICH: I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don't know how many in Michigan now. In these townhalls people come in and they're very emotional meetings. And, you know what they really want to know? If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?
Murphy sent a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last week about the state's intention to start its own exchange. He said he wants to shift the federal exchange user fee to the state in order to fund the effort, as the Asbury Park Press's Michael L. Diamond reports.
At least 380,000 other federal workers are furloughed.
The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the minimum wage hike couldn't be part of the package, under the rules for passing a bill by reconciliation, which allows for passage by a majority threshold, rather than a 60-vote one. Some Democrats who opposed its inclusion suggested it was ill-timed or too rapidly phased in, given that businesses are hurting during the slow recovery from the pandemic, but others argued it didn't belong in the relief package regardless of whether they supported it.
According to the latest estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services, the resulting jumble is likely to have an unpredictable and messy effect on the insurance marketplace, jeopardizing the health coverage of the 20 million people who have gained it under the Affordable Care Act.
Reid got in trouble for praising Obama as a light-skinned African American with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one. He described diminutive Senate colleague Chris Coons (D-Del.) as my pet. He described Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) as a snake oil salesman. He likened opponents of Obamacare to defenders of slavery.
The hearing is on a break until 12:15 p.m.
By the time voting neared, Cruz's field operation was ready to go. I'm convinced it's why he won in Iowa, simply by figuring out who to target and then getting them to the caucuses. His long-term bet that he'd fare better with more religious and more conservative voters was a good one; even in Indiana on Tuesday he won among those who attend church more than once a week and among the very conservative voters, according to preliminary exit polls reported by CNN.
Her daughter interjected. Talk about his immigration, she said.
-- Half a dozen Democrats campaigned in Iowa this weekend: Kamala Harris, who drew huge crowds, and everyone else. Hickenlooper, Tulsi Gabbard, Julián Castro and Bill de Blasio all drew audiences numbering in the double digits. Cleve R. Woodson Jr. and Chelsea Janes report: At one point, Harris, Castro and Hickenlooper were at the same event, a Saturday night soup dinner in Ames. Castro entered quietly from the back and dutifully went up to tables, shook hands and introduced himself. When people noticed Harris had arrived, attendees and TV cameras gravitated toward her, blocking the room's central aisle.
5) Keep Trump distracted and off balance, to minimize the damage he can do. It is often argued that Trump throws out chum about trivial matters to distract the press from covering more damaging stories. But I'm going to suggest an alternate possibility: Trump's cause is also harmed by trivial, petty and burlesque distractions.
-- A new study found D.C. has the greatest intensity of gentrification of any city in the country. According to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, about 40 percent of the city's lower-income neighborhoods experienced gentrification between 2000 and 2013. The group's study also found that, during those years, more than 20,000 of the District's African American residents — the most of any city — were displaced from their neighborhoods.

The broad but uneven repercussions of the opioid epidemic emerge through the data, they write. Texas, Nebraska and Iowa, for example, have remarkably low rates of hospital admissions. So do California and Florida. It's unclear if, when and to what extent the epidemic will surge into places relatively quiet so far, at least compared to hard-hit states in New England and Appalachia.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton challenged Bernie Sanders's stance on gun control during a campaign event in Amers, Iowa on Jan. 12. (Reuters)
Speaking Friday morning to the leading association of medical-device makers (the Advanced Medical Technology Association, known as AdvaMed), Price said he was adamantly opposed to the tax while in Congress, according to sources in the room. The tax doesn't make sense and hurts innovation, Price told attendees. The House bill overhauling Obamacare would repeal nearly all of its taxes, including the medical-device tax, but Senate Republicans have been toying with the idea of retaining some of them -- making the industry nervous that its most-hated part of the ACA won't get erased after all.
-- The White House announced yesterday it would slap $50 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese electronics, aerospace and machinery products. From David J. Lynch: Trump's latest protectionist move threatens to upend global supply chains for corporations such as Apple and Dell, raise prices for American consumers who have grown accustomed to inexpensive electronics and aggravate tensions between the world's two largest economies. … [I]f China responds to this latest tariff action on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it could damage more than one-third of total U.S. exports to China and Hong Kong, [a former Obama White House economist said].
But former council members said previous administrations allowed members to serve full terms before appointing replacements. It is important to have a rolling, transitioning body that crosses administrations that really has a set of diverse outlooks on the epidemic, Sullivan said.
George T. Conway III, conservative lawyer and husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, is a frequent Trump critic. Here's some background. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services didn't respond to questions about its interaction with state marketplaces. But obsevers say the Trump administration doesn't appear to be doing much to bolster the marketplaces.
For more than seven decades, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield has served consumers in the individual market and throughout that time our commitment remained the same: to provide access to affordable, quality healthcare, the company's statement said. As the individual marketplace continues to evolve, Anthem will continue to advocate solutions that will stabilize the market to allow us to return to a more robust presence in the future.
In all, the group spent $20 million on electoral and policy work during that cycle, officials said.
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who backed previous lawsuits seeking to deem the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, said he still supported eliminating the law.
And as Republicans warm to the issue of family leave, a growing group of Democrats — particularly those seeking their party's presidential nomination in 2020 — are also pushing paid leave as a top priority. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and several House Democrats yesterday reintroduced their FAMILY Act, which would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and has become Democrats' template for how the government could guarantee the benefit not just for new parents but also for those who are ill or providing care to a family member.
Ryan made clear, though, that he gets the magnitude of the undertaking. Noting that the House bill caps Medicaid's growth, he boasted: This is the most historic entitlement reform we have ever had!
-- The Juice: When longtime friends and associates of [Trump] want to reach him, they don't go directly to the White House. Instead, they call the woman who's been the gatekeeper at Trump Tower for a quarter century: Rhona Graff. Politico's Tara Palmeri reports: Since Trump took office in January, Graff has become a conduit for those who want to quietly offer advice, make personnel suggestions or get on the president's calendar when he's at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Some of the calls are just a matter of habit for people who have dealt with Graff for decades — but some see her as a way to get around White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and others surrounding Trump in Washington. Roger Stone … described Graff as a favored point of contact for 'anyone who thinks the system in Washington will block their access.' The list includes investor Ken Langone and Hank Greenberg, the chairman & CEO of CV Starr whose assistant recently went to Graff about trying to set up a lunch with Trump … If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona, said New York grocery billionaire John Catsimatidis.
-- The White House stumbled in its initial public response to Soleimani's killing. David Nakamura and Josh Dawsey report: Trump and his top advisers have refused to provide details of what prompted the decision to strike and offered conflicting accounts over whether Soleimani was coordinating imminent attacks on U.S. facilities in the Middle East. The lack of clear information continued late Tuesday in Washington, after Iran said it retaliated for Soleimani's death with missile attacks on military bases in Iraq. The White House announced Trump would make no public remarks in response Tuesday night, nor would any other senior administration officials. Hours later, Trump tweeted that he would address the nation Wednesday morning. … Previously, Trump had caused an international uproar after threatening to attack dozens of Iranian cultural sites — only to retreat Tuesday following statements from his defense secretary and other officials dismissing such actions as illegal.
OPERATOR: And next we'll got to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera with CNBC.
OUCH: The embattled Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts attorney general over the company's role in the opioid crisis. In a motion delivered to AG Maura Healey, lawyers for the family say the suit contains misleading and inflammatory allegations, our Post colleagues Katie Zezima and Lenny Bernstein report.
He inherited the city's stop-and-frisk policy from his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, but it was the Bloomberg administration that ramped up the practice by New York police. Stop-and-frisk actions increased nearly 600 percent in Bloomberg's first 10 years as mayor, reaching a high point of about 686,000 in 2011.
While this change is a step in the right direction, all of us in the health care community must do more to fix the problem of high out-of-pocket costs for Americans living with chronic conditions, the company's chief executive, David A. Ricks, said in a statement. We hope our announcement is a catalyst for positive change across the U.S. health care system.
--HHS is poised to get a boss. Today's probably going to be a very good day for Alex Azar, Trump's nominee to lead HHS. Six Democrats joined with Republicans yesterday on a procedural vote to start considering Azar on the floor, setting up a likely confirmation vote today around 2:15p.m.. The former Eli Lilly executive would replace former HHS Secretary Tom Price, who resigned last fall under fire for his repeated flights on private charter planes at taxpayer expense. Azar's nomination has been considerably less controversial than Price's, and sources at HHS tell us they believe he'll bring better management to the agency.
From Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation:
Trump's plan is likely to face questions from the right, after years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health-care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans.
Most elected officials first run for office for the right reasons: They want to make big policy changes. But every big change has a cost, and if you aren't willing to level with people about those costs — or anything else — don't be surprised when they don't trust you to make the change. You might just find that leveling with your constituents and getting to do big things is more rewarding than spewing a guaranteed applause line at a rally.
Today, we're lunching with McCaul. Here is the rest of our conversation beyond his comments on domestic terrorism. The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Ardern said details on gun law changes will be announced in the next 10 days, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Support from Wagner and Hanger is especially significant because they are two of the Senate's six budget conferees. Together with the two Democratic conferees, they have the power to muscle a pro-expansion budget out of a conference committee and onto the Senate floor.
He thinks that that's the one area where we've fallen short and he wants to see us address it, said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). He made that very clear.
After the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.
But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate [sic]. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, Is he intelligent?
End Common Core. In Trump's first three years, no serious action has been taken on this promise. (He ordered only a review of the federal government's education-related regulations to assess whether they unlawfully interfere with state and local decision-making.) As of Dec. 30, 39 states are implementing Common Core or a revised version of it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In-person campaign events are just one way of taking an electorate's temperature. But they are heady for candidates, who often come away with feedback that contradicts conventional assumptions about the primary. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney, the first Democrat to declare his candidacy, has been absent from many national conversations but has plugged away with small town halls where he argues that a centrist could actually be in the best position to deliver for all Democrats.
No revelation about Russia or Trump's alleged criminality and/or unethical behavior moved them, either. They knew he was a swindler, a jerk and a provocateur, but he was their swindler, jerk and provocateur. And if he was too cozy with Russia or got help to win an election, why he was just outwitting the professional diplomats. Besides, what did it matter to them (his Fox News-saturated base) if Russia ran amok? It wasn't like the Russians threatened their families.
Cut the budget by 20 percent by simply negotiating better prices or renegotiating existing deals. (See above.)
Key stat: In the last 80 years, there were only 10 days in which the Dow was up more than today, Charlie Bilello of Compound Capital Advisors In the last 80 years, there were only 10 days in which the Dow was up more than today, Charlie Bilello of Compound Capital Advisors wrote on Twitter.
The key: In a bid to stop superdelegates from wielding too much power, DNC rules were changed to prevent them from voting on the first ballot in the event no candidate has a majority going into the convention. However, superdelegates can vote on the second ballot and could then have significant sway over who wins.
[The agency] didn't have the time to think about the outliers, said a senior IRS official familiar with the agency's technology operation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. You've got two filing years. You've got divorced people. You've got people who've changed bank accounts. They simply couldn't account for every single scenario.
All that said, permanently removing the option would rightly be seen as an anti-Trump move. Coming off the longest shutdown, and one spurred by the president, Republicans would be making their unhappiness with the results of Trump's strategy pretty clear. It would be a tough needle to thread.
Second, try as he might, Cruz is not getting rid of Kasich before the convention, but he should start using Kasich as emblematic of Washington, insiders who won't spell out their plans (e.g., Where are Kasich's numbers for a balanced budget?). When push comes to shove, Kasich has shown he is willing to keep spending (e.g., expanding Obamacare/Medicaid). Cruz is getting squeezed by Trump's radical populism on one side and Kasich's moderate mush on the other. The key to his success is reclaiming a bold, but sane, agenda that speaks to voters' frustration with government.
The suit, first brought by Planned Parenthood in January 2016, was in response to the release of the heavily edited videos produced in 2015 by the Center for Medical Progress, which secretly taped Planned Parenthood officials talking about the sale of fetal tissue, CNN's Ariane de Vogue and Devan Cole report. The videos sparked a political firestorm, with Republican lawmakers accusing Planned Parenthood of profiting from the sale and and spurring repeated efforts in Congress and states to block funding for the organization. Planned Parenthood officials have maintained that the group does not profit from its sale of tissue donations to medical research and uses any money received to cover its costs.
He has lowered expectations about what Kim might agree to this week: In private discussions with Korea experts, Mr. Pompeo has conceded that he would be lucky if the North agreed to dismantle 60 percent of what the United States has demanded. But he said even that would be more than any other administration has achieved.
The Democrats want to abolish ICE, more or less, Schultz said on CNN. I have nothing against the Democratic Party. I just don't feel represented. In fact, just one declared candidate (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand) has called for abolishing ICE; others have called for restructuring it to deprioritize the deportation of undocumented immigrants and to focus on criminals.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, China has been willing to take draconian measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus, even at enormous inconvenience to its population. In the early days of lockdowns, health officials sometimes sealed apartment buildings to keep people from leaving. Millions were rounded up for overnight flash-testing drives, with people forming lines in the streets in darkness, Eva writes.
Pompeo privately lashed out against Pence after the vice president criticized European allies for trying to save the Iran deal during a crucial meeting on the issue: Aides said he complained Mr. Pence had undermined diplomacy — which one European official said included near-agreement about imposing new sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile tests — and prompted fresh headlines about trans-Atlantic tensions. But publicly, Mr. Pompeo never voiced his anger, keeping relations with the White House stable.
Traditional health care has provided care in a provider-centric, facility-centric manner, Helton said. What we're doing here is we're providing that care in a very intentional, proactive manner to the patient either before they need it or right as they need it. You're moving the focus from provider or facility truly to the individual patient, which is a really big deal.
Make no mistake about it: Trump's budget is a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate, said in a Monday tweet that highlighted Medicare cuts.
RUBIO: This is not a game.
-- Green Book won best picture at the Oscars, while Bohemian Rhapsody took home four awards, the most of any film. Avi Selk reports: The 91st Academy Awards eliminated its hosting duties, divided its trophies, and ultimately divided its audience — awarding best picture to 'Green Book,' which critics had alternately praised for its lighthearted depiction of a black pianist and his Italian American driver's unlikely friendship in the 1960s, or condemned for shortchanging the violent bigotry of that era to focus on a heroic white character. ... Spike Lee scored his long-in-the-making first Oscar win while three nonwhite actors — Rami Malek, Regina King and Mahershala Ali — won major acting awards. Alfonso Cuarón's directing win for Netflix's 'Roma' made it five out of six years that Mexican filmmakers won best director. And largely, the academy's attempts to reform itself after the #MeToo crisis of 2017 were at least partially realized as women — many of them first-time nominees — dominated the acceptance speeches.

Despite the attacks, the ACA has become increasingly entrenched in the American health-care system.
She adds researchers have failed for a decade to reproduce the results of the Berlin case, in part because these transplants are rare and only performed when there's a clinical reason, like cancer, to do them. It's also rare to find the needed donors who are genetic matches and carry two copies of the disabled CCR5 gene.
Trump added that he'll again propose paid family leave in his budget, an idea he spent considerable time on in last year's State of the Union address. I am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child, he said.
And we -- it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam. Now, you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq. And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya. I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations. The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home. That's what we need to do with our military foreign policy.
As administration of the vaccine bottlenecks across the country, the pressure is on to get the shots in as many arms as quickly as possible.
Additionally, his rulings on behalf of those who challenged the Obamacare mandate that employee insurance coverage provide all approved contraceptives seemed instructive. He noted that would require the objecting businesses to underwrite payments for drugs or devices that can have the effect of destroying a fertilized human egg.
For us to pass difficult things, we need Donald Trump to be fully engaged and to be pushing this with individual members and senators in their states, said Doug Heye, a former senior House Republican aide.
The number of confirmed infections continues to rise but the rate of growth is slowing. ... More than a dozen ambulances are lined up alongside the Diamond Princess in Yokohama as medical staff evacuate passengers and crew confirmed as carrying the virus, after 65 more people on board the cruise ship tested positive. China is bracing for the return of some 160 million migrant workers to their cities of employment as the country's economy sputters back to life after an extended holiday vacation following the outbreak.
Republican electoral dynamics fuel conservative opposition
Two more women have since reported being similarly blinded after being treated by U.S. Stem Cell.
Kreidler, a former Democratic congressman and state legislator, sees things differently. He feels the administration is taking steps to further destabilize the marketplaces – including the one he presides over – by seeming to ignore pleas from him and other insurance regulators. To top it off, Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill are working to overhaul big parts of the ACA, casting a huge shadow of uncertainty over the marketplaces and further driving out insurers.
The ACA ultimately was passed on a partisan vote, crippling it from the start because Republicans had no incentive or inclination to ever help fix it, Glenn writes. That is now often cited as justification for repealing the law in a strictly partisan manner.
This week's trip to the City of Brotherly Love was meant to create harmony between the Senate, the House and the president, getting them on the same page on top policy priorities, the pacing of major legislative initiatives and the parliamentary procedures that will be needed to pass the bills.
Long before he submitted the memo, Barr had discussions about potentially serving as Trump's lawyer in the investigation, though he declined. His interactions with the White House have sparked calls from some Democrats that he should recuse himself from Mueller's probe.
The traditional advocacy groups, which have been the dominant representatives of veterans since World War II, view Concerned Veterans for America as an interloper driven by the views of its wealthy backers, not average veterans.
3. The White House doesn't sound like it's going to twist arms
Troy Flint, a spokesperson for the California School Boards Association, told the San Francisco Chronicle that declining community transmission and increased availability of vaccines for educators have had a bigger impact on reopenings than any legislation.
It goes all the way back to a rally Trump held in McCain's home state of Arizona in August shortly after the vote and just a month after McCain announced he had brain cancer.
When Cotton said, I do support repealing Obamacare, he set off a mix of cheers and boos. He added: I have no doubt that some Arkansans benefited from Obamacare. Many more were hurt by Obamacare.
These two phenomena — the Southern realignment and the human propensity to bond with groups — bring us to Klein's central conclusion about the centrality of race for Trump voters and Republicans who believe their white identity is under threat.

-- 13 deaths were attributed to the rioting. Two black teenagers who died in separate fires were never identified. Two other black men — 15-year-old Thomas Stacy Williams and 20-year-old Ernest McIntyre — were shot to death by police. Most of the nine other deaths were attributed to the widespread fires that broke out. (Michael E. Ruane)
Ban foreign lobbyists from raising money for American elections. (This was never passed. Trump also at times welcomed foreign help in his reelection campaign, including from Ukraine and China.)
Now, the administration has finalized the revised payment that will compensate for the loss of the CSR payments. An administrative order was quietly posted on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website on Friday announcing that the federal government will pay $422,206,235 to New York and $46,276,090 to Minnesota for the first three quarters of 2018.
These subsidy adjustments would be temporary, for 2021 and 2022.
We even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. It worked beautifully. Cleveland's coming back. The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.
It's too early to say the U.S. is turning the corner on the coronavirus pandemic, but there are some positive signs. The total number of people who have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine is now greater that the total number of reported infections.
This polling, which comes from Kaiser's February tracking poll and was broken down at my request, shows that 42 percent of Trump voters, and 51 percent of people who approve of Trump, say Medicaid is somewhat or very important to them and their families. More to the point, only 24 percent of Trump voters and 20 percent of people who approve of Trump want to decrease spending on Medicaid, while majorities of both want to keep it the same and many more want to increase it. (A recent Quinnipiac poll also found that 54 percent of Republicans oppose cutting Medicaid.)
Key excerpt: In politics somebody has to lose, but invariably everybody thinks they can win. And you probably can't win unless you believe that you will win — except in the Trump campaign. The leitmotif for Trump about his own campaign was how crappy it was and how everybody involved in it was a loser. He was equally convinced that rival Hillary Clinton's people were brilliant winners — They've got the best and we've got the worst, he frequently said. Time spent with Trump on the campaign plane was often an epic dissing experience: Everybody around him was an idiot.
If the United States truly wants to resolve its fentanyl abuse problem, it needs to strengthen its domestic work, Liu said. Some people link drug consumption with freedom, individuality and liberation.

I have seen it happen, Biden said, citing deals he made to pass emergency funding during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as well as an agreement he struck to end a standoff over federal spending in 2011, when tea party Republicans were threatening to shut the government or default on the national debt.
Republicans have the added pressure of putting themselves under the gun and coming up with a replacement rather quickly. That huge challenge has already led to plenty of fits and starts and disagreements over precisely how to accomplish this massive task.
-- Most importantly of all, Neil Gorsuch is poised to secure a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. Bannon said the president has chosen his appointees with the deconstruction of the administrative state in mind. Nowhere is that more obvious than on the high court.
But we've already seen some movement toward mitigating the impacts of the shutdown. Congress has passed a bill assuring back pay for all federal workers once the shutdown ends. Practically speaking, though, that means all the work that would have been performed by those employees will now be lost productivity, as the government will have to pay people for work they didn't do. Last time, when back pay was awarded after the shutdown concluded, this cost the government an estimated $2 billion.

The work is part of a provocative and growing body of research that documents how polypharmacy — the use of multiple prescription drugs at the same time — has risen in the United States, Carolyn writes. The number of Americans taking at least five prescription drugs at the same time rose sharply between 1999 and 2012, and the elderly are particularly at risk for dangerous interactions between drugs.
Health 202: What do you think of HHS Secretary Alex Azar's moves on prescription drug prices?
Now, Trump and his allies haven't made additional progress in expanding coverage to more Americans — a marked success of the health-care law that has nonetheless stalled in recent years. And the effects of the administration's new policies haven't yet been fully borne out. But so far, the administration may not have moved the needle significantly backward.
They've made numerous subtle changes, such as expanding the availability of junk insurance plans that look like a good deal until you get sick and realize the plans don't cover necessary care. They cut funds for marketing campaigns that alert people about open enrollment periods. They added (probably illegal) Medicaid work requirements and announced a plan to convert part of Medicaid into block grants.
While Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood.
The hang-ups: Republicans need Democrats and/or conservative House lawmakers to pass a spending bill, which means any one of these factions of Congress could decide to leverage their votes for a policy issue that is a non-starter for the other side.
Shalala: They're going to have hearings. I don't know where to go because many people believe the people who have very good health insurance ought to be able to keep it because they have better health insurance than Medicare currently has.
RUBIO: And the Second Amendment -- when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don't follow gun laws. They're criminals. By definition, they ignore the law.

Ryan also took a jab at Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who famously stymied the Senate bill with a thumb-down gesture. What we tried to do was do it all in the House bill with repeal and replace, Ryan said. Like I said, we passed it. And that bill — one guy in the Senate did this instead of that, and that went down. That would have been the biggest entitlement reform bill ever passed by Congress.
They argue the use of automatic, default enrollment into insurance plans could help mitigate the damage. An automatic enrollment program can improve participation by creating options that require little or no premium payment and that require very little effort from the consumer—apart from providing consent, perhaps through failing to opt out, they write.
Expecting voters who didn't care about or, worse, cheered his xenophobia, misogyny, know-nothingism and cruelty were not going to throw up their hands when he demonstrated his xenophobia, misogyny, know-nothingism and cruelty. So long as Trump railed at their favorite targets -- mainstream media, immigrants, government workers, zealous prosecutors and Democrats -- they were content.

They deeply resent the political process and politicians of all stripes, Sen. Michael F. Bennet, a centrist Democrat from Colorado, said of the dwindling number of chief executives who come to see him.

-- Another of Flynn's former associates, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, is trying to clear his name in the Russia probes. Buzzfeed News' Borzou Daragahi reports: Alptekin said the work Flynn did for him — for which he was paid $530,000, and included research into Erdoğan's nemesis, the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen — had nothing to do with the Turkish government, and challenged anyone to prove it did. 'I do have ties to those in power, but I'm not a member of the inner circle,' he said. But Alptekin's story has raised eyebrows in Washington, where many have been left wondering where he got the money to pay Flynn — and why a relatively obscure businessman in Turkey had hired the former general to dig up dirt on one of Erdoğan's enemies.
I think those special counsel regulations should stay in place for the duration of this investigation, and we can do a post mortem then, but I have no reason to think they're not working, Barr said.
One other important note about O'Malley: He tipped the scales to Sanders during a pitched fight between the senator from Vermont and Clinton over Wall Street reform. O'Malley chimed in by bashing Clinton as a defender of the same old, same old when it came to bank behavior — doing Sanders a major favor in the process.
The federal aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 amounted to $120 billion, though Louisiana's share of that amounts to $76 billion. Hurricane Maria was Puerto Rico's worst natural disaster in nearly a century, and the government there was already grappling with near insolvency.
We as humans tend not to be very smart at assessing risk. We see doing something as more risky than not doing anything, said Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and member of an external committee of vaccine advisers to the Food and Drug Administration. But the risk of adverse reaction is so small. People have a higher chance of getting hurt driving to the clinic for a shot than from the shot itself.
But I would get the best people, people that I'd be comfortable with. And we will do the right thing.
— And here are a few more good reads:
Congressional Republicans and President Trump repealed the individual mandate in their tax overhaul that passed last year. But the requirement to purchase coverage doesn't end until 2019. The additional exemptions would apply to the current year, meaning they could be cited by filers preparing their 2018 taxes next year.
He added: They come up — 'When is your next town hall?' And believe me, it's not to give positive input.
Sanders's remaining in the race should serve several salutary purposes for the party and the country. First, seeing him lose overwhelmingly week after week will dispel the notion that the Democratic Party has moved left, or that he is in a dominant position to negotiate with the overwhelming winner. It's not clear why the Biden camp should give Sanders anything.
Pass on the president's annual salary of $400,000.
In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
It is the [Justice] Department's job to promote and enforce the rule of law, not to look the other way, McSwain said at a news conference. Normalizing the use of deadly drugs like heroin and fentanyl is not the answer to solving the opioid epidemic.

* AND REPUBLICANS FEAR HAVING ZERO ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Axios' Jonathan Swan reports on the gloom settling in among Republicans as they realize that total control could result in nine months of failure:
Azar explicitly writes that the definition of success for Americans and for President Trump will be lower list prices — not flat net prices or smaller and fewer list price increases. The inclusion suggests the administration is pushing back on pharmaceutical companies that have so far simply stalled price hikes, wrote Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis:
Democrats have devoted a significant amount of their time to questioning Barr on whether he will make Mueller's eventual report public. Though Barr has broadly committed to making transparency a goal, he has stopped short promising to release whatever document Mueller produces in full.

— Want to keep track of proposed Obamacare premiums for 2019? The Kaiser Family Foundation has released a handy online tracker showing data from nine major cities in eight states plus D.C. The tracker includes preliminary premium information for the lowest-cost bronze plan and benchmark silver plan, which is used to determine the size of premium subsidies.
As the Group of 20 summit got underway, the president's attention was clearly divided as he took time between bilateral meetings with India President Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to watch a few minutes of the second night of the first Democratic primary debate on a television set at the conference center.
Almost proving McConnell's point, two hours after the interview, Trump held an hour-long news conference to announce his new Labor secretary nominee. He veered into a tirade against the media and other controversial statements. Because it happened while McConnell was hosting a GOP luncheon, he declined later in the day to comment on the Trump news conference.
The FDA has said that toxic elements are present in the environment and enter the food supply through soil, water or air; they cannot be completely removed. But some lawmakers want are calling for more-rigorous regulation.

What he did is political suicide for the Republican Party, Donald Trump said in an interview recently dug up by Mother Jones.
OAN has only four correspondents of its own, based mainly in Washington. Earlier this month, in 16 consecutive stories, those reporters interviewed only conservative lawmakers and experts — a sharp contrast from Fox and MSNBC, which, despite their overt political leanings, routinely include the other side in their reports.

I think it's pretty safe to say this is not a period steeped in bipartisanship yet, he said.
Trump does have reason be wary of McCain. If there is a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, McCain is still the face of its anti-Trump wing, even from home in Arizona.
The provisions to raise money for the ACA did not go into effect until 2013, three years after the law's passage. The CBO's report is based on data from 2014 and does not include tax data since then. (The CBO report, which tracks American income inequality broadly, says there was not available relevant data for the years since.)
Good that McConnell is a constitutionalist, first and foremost. In the battle of free speech vs. regulation under the guise of campaign finance reform — which pitted McConnell against the late senator John McCain — the 2003 case McConnell v. Federal Election Commission laid the groundwork for the eventual triumph of speech in the landmark 2010 Citizens United decision. An advocate for Kentucky since he arrived in the Senate in 1985, McConnell has been a Reagan hawk on defense spending, and he rallied support for President George W. Bush's surge strategy in Iraq. He lined up GOP support for the 2008 financial rescue package when the tea party was raging against it. McConnell hasn't always won; he failed to stop Obamacare, for instance. But he also returned to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, hated by constitutionalists. He kept open the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. He also averted the fiscal cliff and other crises by wrestling three major spending deals with then-Vice President Joe Biden.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We don't need nice.
The American Enterprise Institute holds a discussion on Reconnecting Health Care Policy with Economics: Finding and Fixing Distortive Incentives on Thursday.
Mike Pence broke his silence to allege that the election was marked by significant voting irregularities. In an op-ed for the Daily Signal, Pence writes that, Many of the most troubling voting irregularities took place in states that set aside laws enacted by state legislatures in favor of sweeping changes ordered by governors, secretaries of state, and courts, adding that Democrats have chosen to sweep those valid concerns and reforms aside and to push forward a brazen attempt to nationalize elections in blatant disregard of the U.S. Constitution. HR 1, he says, would increase opportunities for election fraud, trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections, and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters.
Political control R Reagan R Senate D House Why it happened Reagan and House Democrats disagreed on several issues that weren't resolved before a shutdown took effect. How it was resolved Democrats got a promise of a vote on welfare expansion but caved on most of their wishes, and Republicans offered a concession on the sale of the public-owned railway.
— States could also create lists of drugs that are covered by Medicaid plans — meaning they could exclude some drugs.
I am focusing on stopping the Democrats' 'Medicare-for-none' scheme, he told Politico's Burgess Everett.
Fauci: Yeah, lots of luck. (Dan Helming, Trenton, N.J.)
Biden signed executive orders last month directing government agencies to re-examine Trump era health-care policies, including waivers that let states change the Medicaid program.
So I'm a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pledged to remain focused on health care, but Democrats threatened to slow business down in an effort to force the appointment of a special prosecutor to take up the FBI-led investigation into Russia's meddling in last year's election. The Democrats' power to do so appeared limited to short-term delays, however.
I don't know that they'll go to waste, Adalja said.
Their fundamental economic model isn't going to change because of some tariffs, Buttigieg said, speaking of China.
In other words: Now that Republicans are finally in a position to make good on their promise to repeal Obamacare, they don't have a plan to do it. Senate Republicans are just throwing a plan at the wall to see what sticks.
Sackler's support of the plan was not previously made public, but ProPublica obtained a sealed court document of a 2015 deposition given by Sackler part of a Kentucky lawsuit against Purdue. In a statement, the company criticized the intentional leak of the deposition but also acknowledged it made a determination to avoid emphasizing OxyContin as a powerful cancer pain drug, because of a concern that non-cancer patients would be reluctant to take a cancer drug, David writes.
President Trump has delivered and will continue to on the issues of health care, border security, and trade, she said. To suggest otherwise is to deny the facts. We will be running on the president's successes on these issues and a myriad of others.
For example, the FDA has started prioritizing applications for generics where there's just one competitor on the market. In June, Gottlieb instructed the FDA to publish and regularly update a list of approved drugs that are no longer protected by patents or exclusivity periods and have no generic competition – in other words, drugs that could be highly attractive to a generic developer.
For its part, CVA — which had refrained from publicly calling for Shulkin's firing — commended his departure.
Someone who got their insurance from an employer – and that's about half of Americans under 65 (155 million) – presumably would not be affected, though the CBO did project that under the initial version of the AHCA 7 million fewer people would be covered by employers than under current law by 2026.
Tax reform and judicial appointments are central pillars of Trump's record that were enabled by McConnell. Now impeachment will offer the senator a fresh, high-profile chance to showcase his value to the president — and to Trump's supporters.
4. Give up and say they tried
Alexander notably signed on to a question that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) asked the House Democrats' impeachment managers late Thursday night. The question included the premise that even Bolton's testimony wouldn't change the impeachment calculus and that therefore, for this and other reasons, his testimony would add nothing to this case.
Whenever health-care laws are changed, there are unknown and unintended consequences. The current system does not take into account a person's health status when assessing premiums. But, as a Brookings Institution analysis suggested, under the AHCA's provisions, healthy people might have an incentive to join plans based on health status. That would leave sicker people in the community rated plans, which in turn would face higher premiums. Over time, that could make the community rating meaningless. (Update: The CBO in its revised report on the AHCA said this was quite possible for states representing about one-sixth of the U.S. population. We explored that in detail in this article.)
Enter the comprehensive reform proposal drafted by a group of U.S. and Canadian physicians and drug policy experts (led by me and Joel Lexchin of Toronto), published May 17 in the British Medical Journal. Our proposal outlines a pharmaceutical vision that, unlike Trump's, would both reduce costs and improve health.
They have health care right now, he said of Democrats, according to a pool report. We have to take that away from them. We have to protect and cannot run away from a thing called preexisting conditions.
TRUMP: You haven't employed in your life one person.
In his new memoir to be released later this month, the Arizona Republican offers a harsh assessment of Trump's leadership and says he feels less constrained to share his thoughts because he is not seeking reelection. Writing that the president has declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones, McCain adds that Trump's appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values. According to NBC News, McCain's 2008 campaign rival, former president Barack Obama, will eulogize him, and McCain doesn't even want Trump in the building.
Republicans came back and said: 'We can't include a straight repeal of the mandate, but can we just dial the penalty for violating the mandate down to zero?'  Reynolds explains. And the parliamentarian said that was okay.
The story of U.S. drug costs is a hugely complicated one and its villain shifts depending on which part of the drug supply chain is telling the tale. When pharmaceutical executives had their turn at the Senate Finance Committee in February, they characterized the PBMs as the bad guys, complaining that these third-party negotiators don't pass drug discounts along to consumers but pocket them instead.
AHH: In another radio interview, Azar praised the bipartisan drug pricing legislation from Wyden and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
Obamacare has put far too many able-bodied adults on the Medicaid rolls, leaving many disabled and vulnerable Americans at the back of the line, Pence said.
The House had a difficult time passing its own measure after a roller-coaster attempt, with the first version being pulled before reaching the floor after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) determined he did not have the votes. House Republicans went back to the drawing board and passed their own measure — which would more quickly kill Medicaid expansion and provide less-generous federal subsidies — on May 4.
But the effort to nudge the Senate's health-care bill to the right could alienate moderates and complicate leaders' push to keep the GOP conference united for a vote in which only two members can defect.
It really will not be attractive from the standpoint of sharply lower premiums or costs, Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told me.
Abortion opponents said Handel's victory is a mark against Planned Parenthood, which had vociferously opposed her. Handel was famously forced out of the Susan G. Komen Foundation back in 2012, after she had advised the breast cancer charity to cut ties with the women's health and abortion provider.
On its Facebook page, the Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity posted a photo of Pence by a remark he made at a National Governors Association meeting in July 2017.
— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
Despite the committee's effort to accommodate HHS' legitimate interests, the department has missed mutually-agreed deadlines, produced meager and incomplete sets of information (much of which is available publicly) and taken a posture of nonchalance with respect to the committee's requests, wrote Gowdy, who announced this week he won't seek reelection.
Most important, however, were the court's decisions concerning education and desegregation. In the early 1970s, a consensus was quickly forming among law professors and lower courts that the Constitution's equal protection clause required equitable funding across rich and poor school districts in a state. When parents and students from a poor, heavily Mexican American district challenged Texas's school finance system, a federal district court ordered the state to equalize funding.
Months into the global vaccine rollout, the pace remains staggeringly unequal, with wealthy countries leaving poorer ones in the dust. And they aren't competing in a vacuum: The success of the former has come very much at the expense of the latter, Adam Taylor reports.
It's not difficult to see how such things can quickly go wrong. Former congressman Randy Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.) and superlobbyist Jack Abramoff went to jail because of earmark-related bribes. Then there was the infamous Bridge to Nowhere, a project to connect the tiny Alaskan city of Ketchikan, population about 8,000, to a nearby airport that earned an earmark for $223 million in 2005 and was finally scrapped 10 years later.
Impose a minimum sentence of five years in federal prison for any violent felon who commits a crime using a gun, with no chance for parole or early release. (See above.)
I don't share a lot of his philosophy, but he understands, as someone who has been in the administration, the importance of the rule of law and compliance, Heitkamp said. I believe I can work with him in the future, especially on Indian health.
The other candidates, because of the system we have, think that winning one of those first early states will propel them into a world where they can then raise money and then go to the big states, he said. They don't have any choice, I suppose. They don't have the money. They have to show they are viable to get the money to be viable.
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by law in 1946 to provide presidents with objective economic advice. Naturally, as an arm of the White House, the analyses produced under each administration tend provide economic justification for a president's policies. But they are supposed to be grounded in facts.
-- Senate Democrats ramped up opposition Monday to the emerging bill with a series of mostly symbolic moves, including speeches that went late into last night. At one point early Monday evening, more than a dozen Democratic senators sat at their desks on the Senate floor and took turns standing and asking for committee hearings on the bill and for the text to be released for greater scrutiny, Sean Sullivan reports.
Stop AT&T from buying Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. Federal antitrust regulators would have to review and approve that type of merger. (Trump's Justice Department attempted to block the merger, but failed.)
It's not a good place to be, she wrote in her reply to The Post's query. 62 years old and without any health- care coverage.
Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, withdrew from the Title X family planning program after the Trump administration approved stricter rules.
What we're trying to do is get some sound action and truly reduce drug prices, Cummings told me.
Trying again for Obamacare repeal is the last thing most Capitol Hill Republicans want to do. Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell signaled to Trump he wants no part of it, telling Politico he looks forward to seeing what the president is proposing and what he can work out with the speaker.
In a brief filed in a Texas federal court and an accompanying letter to House and Senate leaders of both parties, the Justice Department said it mostly agrees with the 20 Republican-led states bringing the suit. These states are pointing to a major 2012 case where the Supreme Court upheld the ACA's constitutionality by saying the law's penalty for being uninsured fell under the government's power to tax.
The 44-year-old computer programmer and father of two was forced to turn to the federal marketplace, where he said he discovered that the cheapest plan for his family cost $900 a month and carried a $14,000 deductible. Given his family's $71,000 salary — a sum he and his wife earn working four jobs — he opted to go without health insurance.
Climate change is the great existential crisis we face today. Civilization itself depends upon reliable climate patterns. There are droughts and floods, but when those aberrations become the new norm civilization cannot thrive, farmlands cannot grow crops, cities have no water supply or are drowned by too much of it. Humanity is resilient, but we need to face reality. For the past four years President Trump and the Republicans have pushed a policy of denial. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris must restore reason, science and devotion to facts so we can survive this looming crisis.
Each of these 2020 candidates are straining to make the economy appear worse. In doing so, they are following the example of President Trump, who in his campaign for the presidency repeatedly used to make a similar claim about people having to hold more than one job, such as saying in September 2016: Many people, because of Obamacare and for other reasons, are holding two jobs.
Van Hollen will face Republican Kathy Szeliga, a state delegate who represents parts of Baltimore and Harford counties, in November. Szeliga won in a large GOP field on Tuesday, but she faces an uphill battle in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 2 to 1.
Arguing the cuts will threaten access to care for many low-income and vulnerable patients, the hospitals say they'll continue pursuing the lawsuit. But the judge insisted the associations' comments on the proposed rule weren't enough to give them standing to sue, saying they'll have to cite specific reimbursement claims in order for a lawsuit to proceed.
We have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove with the defense, Murkowski told an Alaska radio station late last month, adding that she was disturbed by McConnell's coziness with the administration on impeachment.
Barr noted the memo's analysis was narrow in scope, and he made clear that while he was skeptical about Mueller's theory of obstruction — at least as it had been described publicly — he did not believe it was impossible to accuse a president of obstructing justice.
The federal government already requires international travelers to be tested before they board flights to the United States — a mandate that drew praise from many in the aviation industry, our colleagues write. But requiring tests for domestic travelers raises a different set of challenges for the administration.
From the publisher of the Federalist:
I am not for open borders, he said in a recent appearance in Iowa. I do think that there are places where physical barriers along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border makes sense.
• Revoke Trump's plan to quit the World Health Organization.
Everybody I know in the Senate — everybody — is in favor of maintaining coverage for preexisting conditions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters. There is no difference in opinion about that whatsoever.
When Trump's voters finally get hit, then they may finally abandon him. (His support among key groups such as suburban men and white, non-college educated men dropped significantly.) We'd like to think all Americans care about one another, want to point to the president as a role model for their kids and fret when bad policies hurt the most vulnerable. Many Americans do operate that way -- just not Trump's hardcore base. This is a zero-sum ground -- immigrants or them, elevation of Christianity or its eradication, white nationalism or white victimhood.

That same disagreement would almost certainly derail one of three bills Democrats are teeing up for consideration at tomorrow's hearing. The measure, sponsored by Reps. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.), would give states money to either set up reinsurance programs to boost insurers with sicker patients or reduce out-of-pocket costs for poorer enrollees.

Some GOP lawmakers and strategists worry about rolling out a plan that has no chance of passage in the current Congress and that Democrats could pick to pieces during a long campaign. Many also have little appetite to return to the debate over repealing Obamacare.
Those drugs could potentially include insulin — whose price rose about 300 percent from 2002 to 2013 — as well as drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and cardiovascular conditions.
But Faircloth, a retiree, has growing reservations about the president's character, his environmental policies and his incessant tweeting. She was especially appalled when Trump intervened to prevent the military from disciplining Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes. I think I've gotten to the point where I need to step outside the box, she said.
I think that there was nothing that could be added to the bill that the Freedom Caucus would ever vote yes on, Poe told CNN on Monday. I got the opinion that there's some members of the Freedom Caucus, they would vote no against the Ten Commandments if they came up for a vote.
Perriello has capitalized on national Democrats' anxiety about reclaiming relevance and defying President Trump. He has drawn most of his money from outside Virginia, including a massive stake from billionaire George Soros, and picked up endorsements from the leaders of the wing that believes the party must be more populist and progressive — notably Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
The quickest, fastest way to do it is to build on Obamacare, Biden said. Urgency matters. There's people right now facing what I faced. … I am against any Democrat who wants to take down Obamacare.
TRUMP: I will. Don't worry about it, Marco. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it little Marco, I will.
For people with diabetes, insulin can be as essential as air, said Steve Miller, Cigna's chief clinical officer. We need to ensure these individuals feel secure in their ability to afford every fill so they don't miss one dose.
For the first half of the 20th century, Milwaukee was a bastion of socialism, so much so that aspiring leaders elsewhere verbified the Wisconsin city, running on platforms of Milwaukeeizing their own hometowns.
Nassar, 54, is serving an effective life sentence in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting nine girls and women in Michigan, as well as to federal child pornography crimes, Will and Cindy write. The settlement will pay $425 million to the 332 girls and women who have come forward to date, averaging about $1.28 million per victim. Michigan State will set aside an additional $75 million in a trust fund for any victims who come forward in the future.
It is because of our employees that Cigna continues to deliver on our mission to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of those we serve, Cigna CEO David Cordani said in a statement. Reinvesting a portion of savings from tax reform in our employees is a reinvestment in our mission.

Many of these changes have largely flown under the political radar. But the prospect of a public health crisis has drawn more attention to the holes in our health-care system — including those that may have predated President Trump but have widened under his leadership.
Late on Wednesday, he took to Twitter again to try to clarify that he would never purposefully support the Democratic efforts.
As some ambulance services go out of business, others from neighboring counties will have to cover those areas, he added. To cut costs, some may keep fewer ambulances in the field. Both scenarios would result in longer wait times. Rural areas, which already struggle with wait times and coverage, could be especially hit hard.
It's a symbiotic relationship. On the day the impeachment trial opened, the Roberts Court rejected a plea by Democrats to expedite its consideration of the latest legal attempt by Republicans to kill Obamacare. The court sided with Republicans who opposed an immediate Supreme Court review because the GOP feared the ruling could hurt it if the decision came before the 2020 election.
The House Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on economic opportunity holds a hearing on resources to address veteran hunger on Thursday.
But not everyone who turns down a vaccine is a hardcore anti-vaxxer, Frieden cautions. He says that there is a movable middle of people. They aren't going to be camping out overnight to get an early vaccine, but they may be convincible if costs and other barriers are low. Frieden says it's crucial to keep a door open for those people, for instance, seeing whether they might be willing to schedule a shot three weeks from now instead of immediately.
-- The Justice Department formally asked a federal judge to waive the limit on how long the government can detain immigrant families together. NBC News's Pete Williams explains: Since 1997, an order from a federal district judge in California has set limits on how long children can be detained by immigration authorities. Originally intended to protect only unaccompanied minors, it was amended in 2015 to cover children held with their parents. Under the order, children must generally be moved to an approved facility for minors within 20 days. As long as that limit remains in force, Justice Department lawyers said, the government must either separate the child from the parents or release the family members while they wait for their immigration hearing. But release is not a desirable option, the government said, because many families fail to show up for their hearings and simply remain in the country illegally.

That recent history suggests that it's not inconceivable that the 2016 election might, again, turn into a battle of party bases. That seems especially likely because the two presumptive nominees are broadly disliked by the other party -- and the general election campaign has barely begun.
OOF: In the push to implement Medicaid work requirements in several states, the Trump administration has so far failed to enforce federal rules meant to protect patients, the Los Angeles Times's Noam N. Levey reports.
In many ways, Paul looks even more spineless than his colleagues. There was no cost in this case to him sticking to his guns. First, the committee vote did not matter in terms of getting Pompeo confirmed: A committee vote against recommendation might look bad for the White House, but Pompeo would still have gotten a vote of the full Senate. With Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) already on record as supporting the CIA director, Pompeo had the votes needed even without Paul's support.
Lee and Cruz, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), another member of the working group, have been in touch over the past month with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), according to a House GOP aide.
While HHS said it believed anti-discrimination provisions should apply only to male or female as determined by biology, LGBT activists argued the rules could be used to deny care to transgender patients. The Trump rules have been blocked in federal court, but activists are pressuring HHS to start reversing them quickly.
Washington is just one of about 15 states where many residents will have only one individual market plan – or none at all -- to choose from in 2018. In Ohio, more than 10,000 residents across 18 counties may have no insurance options. About 67,000 customers in 25 western Missouri counties are facing the consequences of no marketplace insurers next year, barring a potential entrance by the Centene.
While the Federalist Society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. Ever since the founding symposium at Yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. The group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders Charles and David Koch.

As I wrote in this Health 202, paid family leave is an issue ripe for partisan cooperation because it's extremely popular among the public. But at least so far, Democrats have blasted the GOP plans as insufficient while Republicans accuse Democrats of promising benefits that cost too much.
The success of Ryan's ideas — and their gradual transformation into Republican orthodoxy — is a remarkable story in its own right. It began in 2008, with a congressman urging his colleagues to cut taxes big and grab two political live wires at once.
Trump's electoral college margin was relatively narrow by historical standards. He ranks 46th out 58 elections. A switch of about 40,000 votes in three states would have swung the election to Clinton.
Mr. Trump, your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, decimate American workers. However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas. So, which is it?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
In order for people to stay connected to something on a TV screen, they need consistent reinforcement that the story is developing, that there's new information, he said. The chyrons help do that. The urgency of live TV is one of the remaining core strengths of broadcasting.
In a meeting with Democratic leaders — one he chose to televise — he willingly accepted responsibility for the shutdown.
Technically, by the way, it's two provisions: Guaranteed issue, which means insurance companies must sell insurance to anyone who wants to buy it, and community rating, which means that people who buy similar insurance and are the same age pay similar prices. The two together made insurance affordable for people with, say, cancer, though before passage of the ACA, even minor health problems could have led an insurance company to deny coverage.
-- Journalist Ronan Farrow, who has reported on the Enquirer's efforts to aid the Trump campaign by killing stories about his alleged mistresses, said he received a similar threat. Allyson Chiu reports: In a tweet Thursday night, Farrow wrote that he and the unnamed journalist 'fielded similar 'stop digging or we'll ruin you' blackmail efforts from AMI.' … Farrow added that he 'did not engage as I don't cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.' … In response to Farrow, former Associated Press editor Ted Bridis tweeted, 'We were warned explicitly by insiders that AMI had hired private investigators to dig into backgrounds of @AP journalists looking into the tabloid's efforts on behalf of Trump.'
Operation Warp Speed leader will take a reduced role in Biden's administration.
Expand the economy 4 percent a year. In 2017, the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent, well short of Trump's promised target. In 2018, the GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, still far short of Trump's 4 percent goal. For 2019, analysts estimate the GDP grew about 2.2 or 2.3 percent. Unless something dramatic happens in 2020 — the consensus is that annual growth will be 1.9 percent — Trump will never meet his goal, and so this is a promise broken. He never even achieved this goal on a quarterly basis.
Republicans see the potentially crowded Democratic primary as a sign of weakness for Bryce. Democrats interpret it as a sign of strength that many in their party see an opportunity to flip Ryan's seat in November. House Democrats' campaign arm here in Washington has Bryce on its red to blue program as a promising candidate to flip a Republican seat.
The last few months have seen a trickle of news on insurers exiting markets or requesting big rate increases, with more announcements expected as deadlines approach in other states. Republicans have pointed to insurer exits or massive rate increases as evidence that the Affordable Care Act is dead. Democrats, meanwhile, have blamed Republicans for refusing to provide companies the regulatory clarity they need to continue providing insurance to millions of Americans.

TRUMP: ... again, there will be a lot of advertising. It's the only thing that might save him. But I doubt it.
They are an unlikely pair — Northam, quiet and understated, and Stanley, the Senate's charismatic class clown. One sits to the left of center, the other to the right. Yet both have sunny personalities, a love for silly pranks and independent streaks.
Border security? Many in Congress are threatening not to pay for Trump's wall. Lawmakers and local officials are threatening pushback on the sanctuary cities executive order. And, of course, the travel ban has the administration tied up in litigation and, according to polls, is very unpopular. Maybe Trump will admit net immigration is now flowing to Mexico and declare victory in the effort to stop the nonexistent flood of illegals.
The new rules are likely to spark court battles, just like the administration's previous guidance allowing states to incorporate work or volunteering requirements into their Medicaid programs.
The president recently delivered the biggest blow to Planned Parenthood in three decades when he implemented the Protect Life Rule, which prohibits Title X family-planning funds from going to any clinic that performs on-site abortions. Planned Parenthood announced last year that it would leave the Title X program, barring a court victory.
The Biden administration told The Post that it would pursue the idea of donating excess vaccine doses once there is sufficient supply in the United States, potentially by working through Covax. But the administration provided little detail on these plans.

-- Local leaders and residents of Nogales, Ariz., are expressing opposition to the razor wire repeatedly applied to the border fence separating the town from Mexico. Eli Rosenberg reports: The town's city council passed a resolution unanimously on Wednesday to formally condemn the wire, and demand that it be taken down over safety concerns. Residents and business owners have told local reporters that it makes the town feel like a war zone — an inquisition, one said — and worry about the effect on its life and commerce downtown. Local newspaper columnists have panned it; a letter writer, Allen Zale, who said he served with the Army, said it reminded him of his time stationed in Berlin.
And in Iowa, the last remaining insurer is threatening to pull out, potentially causing the state's entire individual marketplace to collapse.
What's next? Ex-Republican officials disillusioned with the GOP's direction have started to discuss an anti-Trump third party, Reuters's Tim Reid scooped last night. A Zoom call Friday, co-hosted by Evan McMullin, included over 120 former GOP lawmakers, officials, ambassadors, and strategists to discuss a platform of principled conservatism.
She was more involved in Biden's campaign and headed up his HHS transition team. That could put her in a better spot to immediately start working with civil servants within CMS.
Paul Ryan was the hope of the GOP, but he wilted when his leadership was needed most. Instead of checking Trump, he helped normalize him. Now, metastasized Trumpism in the base and broad American opposition to it are forcing him out. Other leaders should learn from this, tweeted Evan McMullin, the independent who ran against Trump in 2016.

I plan to get into it and see exactly what the horror stories are, where the problems and potential abuses are and also whether [former] Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions's guidelines are providing sufficient protection, Barr told Lee. At the same time, I think it is a valuable tool in law enforcement.
The message to pro-life conservatives was clear: They were the black sheep of the Republican coalition. Their presence was tolerated because their votes were needed. But while Republican presidential candidates couldn't win the nomination without declaring themselves pro-life, the GOP establishment not-so-secretly loathed pro-lifers. The prevailing attitude was: There they go again, making people uncomfortable by talking about abortion.

In Miami on Thursday afternoon, Obama cited Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and the creation of Medicare drug benefits, as he said, No major social innovation in America has ever worked smoothly at the start.
A group of 17 Democratic-led states that have won standing in the case also filed a brief last night arguing for the ACA's preservation. The Texas lawsuit is based on a dubious legal claim with the sole goal of stripping Americans of their healthcare, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. The Trump administration won't defend the law of the land and 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions like asthma and cancer. Shame on the administration for gambling with the healthcare coverage of 20 million Americans.
As a growing number of senators have publicly doubted a health-care bill can pass, some Senate Republican aides and associates are already privately discussing how the GOP would craft its midterm campaign message if it fails to pass a health-care bill, suggesting they could tell voters they need to build a bigger majority to finally undo the ACA.
Before the trial officially began Thursday afternoon, dozens of senators from both parties entered a secure facility in the Senate basement to view a classified document provided by Jennifer Williams, a national security adviser to Vice President Pence. … The document had been previously submitted to the House Intelligence Committee. Some senators spent only a few minutes in the facility; others stayed for the better part of an hour. Several Democrats emerged to say they didn't understand why the document had been classified. 'I don't believe it's being withheld from the public for national security reasons. It may be withheld for political security reasons,' said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).
As a senator, Biden had a hand in adopting mandatory background checks for gun sales, which exist to this day, and a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, which expired in 2004. The gun rights lobby, despite recent turmoil in its ranks, remains a potent political force.
Members were armed with loads of data to throw at the executives. Here are a few of the committee's most shocking findings, which lawmakers referred to repeatedly:
December: Flynn pleads guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump signs a tax reform bill into law.
Feb. 25. During a GOP presidential primary debate, Trump declared: I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better, but preexisting conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep preexisting conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it. … Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.
I am sympathetic with Harris's plan for what amounts to a negative income tax that would put an income floor under all Americans — I recently proposed something similar myself. But to make such an idea affordable and attract conservative supporters of universal basic income would also require cutting back on existing support programs, particularly those that involve large bureaucracies and high compliance costs and demean low-income recipients. Unwilling to challenge liberal interest groups, Harris rejected that approach out of hand.
Biden's 2020 election victory drew cheers from migrants stranded in squalid, freezing refugee camps in Mexico, and some rushed across a bridge in the border city of El Paso while chanting his name. Unlike Trump — whose tough talk of an immigration crackdown led to record-low border crossings in his first months in office — Biden has arrived as the numbers are rising.
The tell was Trump's false and slanderous claim that the missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.
But spending would increase if the lowest half of prices were increased to the median market price and the top quarter of prices declined to the 75th percentile.
OOF: Massachusetts has joined a growing list of states and local governments suing Purdue Pharma, the maker of opioid painkiller OxyContin. Massachusetts is the first state to personally name the company's executives in the suit, the Associated Press's Allanna Durkin Richer reports. The complaint specifies 16 current and former executives and board members, including members of the Sackler family who own the company, and chief executive Craig Landau.
I have the utmost respect for Bob and his distinguished record of public service, Barr wrote, adding that he considered Mueller a friend. When he was named special counsel, I said that his selection was 'good news' and that, knowing him, I had confidence he would handle the matter properly. I still have that confidence today.
These are some of history's most prolific presidential losers:
But the ideological disagreement over how to revise the ACA continued among Republicans.
We have some hard questions we want to ask him, and we don't understand why he wouldn't want to sit down with his constituents when there's this much concern, she said.
Azar said in a letter to Congress that the government would work with the private sector to ensure that the vaccine is affordable.
George said in an interview with The Washington Post that his tweeting helps him avoid screaming at his wife about her boss. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day, he said. Frankly, it's so I don't end up screaming at her about it.
-- A former Indian Health Service pediatrician was sentenced to five lifetime prison terms for sexually abusing boys. From the WSJ: Stanley Patrick Weber, 71, groomed and abused Native American boys as young as about 9 years old on reservations in Montana and South Dakota between 1995 and 2011, according to court documents. His supervisors in the federal government buried their own suspicions about his conduct, tried to silence others who raised concerns, and transferred the doctor from one reservation to another after managers concluded he might have molested his patients …Weber was convicted in South Dakota in September of abusing four of his patients at the IHS's Pine Ridge hospital and his government housing unit there.

AHH: Two different measures aiming to repeal Idaho's voter-approved Medicaid expansion failed in a state House committee.
As the third decade of the 21st century opens, the United States finds itself in a paradoxical situation: The economy is booming, unemployment is historically low, the nation is not involved in any major wars, and the international situation is (for the moment) reasonably stable. Yet voters do not feel stable or happy: On the right, many believe that the country they knew is being taken away from them by immigrants and shadowy elites, while for the left, democracy itself is being challenged by a Republican Party that has turned into a cult of personality. In 2016, America elected a president whose personal characteristics — narcissism, ignorance and barely disguised racism — should have immediately disqualified him. Yet Donald Trump became president and remains an object of adulation for at least a third of the country.
Many forces are at play in why the marketplace situation improved this year, making it less clear how much can be directly attributed to the two-year-old administration. Critics have also charged HHS with taking actions that could result in higher premiums, such as advancing short-term and association health plans that will likely lure some healthy enrollees away from the marketplaces.
But both measures came at a steep cost, contributing mightily to a mushrooming deficit that the Congressional Budget Office projected this week will reach $1 trillion in 2020 and exceed that mark in perpetuity. Ryan has sounded the alarm about the nation's deficit and debt for years but leaves the situation worse than he found it, despite proposing budgets over the years that slashed spending and transformed Medicare into a voucher program for younger Americans.
Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.
Trump is fond of saying that the easiest thing for Republicans to do would be to let Obamacare fall under its own weight. And there's some truth to that.
David Montgomery is a staff writer for the magazine.
Ryan also expressed some wishful thinking about his hopes of reforming entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, although that's politically challenging for Congress to do because it involves cutting government spending:
Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.
It's an insanity plea. As in, everyone appalled by Trump's behavior must be insane.
He's had some very thoughtful, meaningful ideas on how to address that that would certainly be accepted by conservatives, if that's the direction the Senate decides to go, Meadows said.
Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he discussed options for individual tax credits and a possible expansion of the existing system of health savings accounts that allow individuals to set aside untaxed income for health care.

One image showed Jeffrey Anesin, a ward chairman in the city's working-class neighborhood of Troy Hill, posing in a Trump hat with the caption 2020 Trump Train!
Repealing taxes is popular, but Corker warned that doing so sets up a perpetual trap for Republicans. If you repeal the taxes on the front end and you end up with, say, a Medicaid expansion, or even if it winds up being refundable tax credits, you're still expending dollars, he said. And if you repeal all the sources of income on the front end, then ― Corker paused to emphasize the absurdity of the position ― it's difficult to me to see how you ever get to a place where you actually fund what you're expending. And then you've self-created the doc-fix scenario, where each year it just keeps getting extended, you're piling up the deficits, because I don't see Republicans voting for a tax increase. That's why to me it's important that this happen simultaneously, Corker said. I don't see a scenario where people are pushing to insure less people. You gotta have money to pay for that.
Out of the eight states approved to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, not one is set up with plans to track the effect of the change, including whether beneficiaries find jobs or see health improvements. And nine of the 17 states that have sought federal permission to implement Medicaid work mandates have been allowed by the Trump administration to proceed with their applications despite failing to calculate the number of people who could lose coverage, according to a review of state and federal Medicaid records, Noam writes.

But I said, Don't hit Iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.

-- The administration has dubbed this to be Tech Week, which kicked off with a meeting between Trump and several of the industry's top CEOs. AP's Catherine Lucey and Josh Boak report: Apple CEO Tim Cook and Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, were among those attending an afternoon of working groups on issues like technology infrastructure, cybersecurity and visas for foreign workers. Trump has spoken out against illegal immigration and signed an executive order banning travelers from six Muslim-majority countries, a source of tension with technology firms. 'We're working very diligently with everybody, including Congress, on immigration so that you can get the people you want in your companies,' the president said. The administration drew a mix of flattery and policy requests from the assembled technology leaders and university officials.

Many of those outbreaks originated after unvaccinated individuals traveled to Europe, the Philippines and Israel, where the infection is more common, and returned to the United States after contracting the illness, Lena writes. And the outbreaks have also sparked an increase in activity among anti-vaccine activists. In Rockland County, N.Y., where officials banned unvaccinated children from public spaces amid its growing outbreak, anti-vaccination activists compared the public health measures to the Nazi persecution of Jews.
Indeed. It goes without saying that many leaders on the right have dropped the ball. Too few conservatives were sounding the alarm this summer when Trump began his warpath. Too few conservatives — including the GOP campaigns — took any significant action at all over the past many months. And too few on the right have been willing over the past many years to recognize the legitimate frustrations of millions of Americans, manifested in the palpable populist anger that is fueling Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), and attempt to channel those frustrations to productive and helpful ends.
Forbes magazine pegs Bloomberg as the world's ninth-richest person, with an estimated net worth of $55.5 billion, and he's set no cap for how much he's willing to spend in the 2020 race. For example, he will spend $10 million, pocket change for him, to air a 60-second spot during the Super Bowl. After Bloomberg's campaign announced this yesterday, the Trump campaign let it be known that it too will spend that amount to run a commercial early in the game, the most-watched television event of the year.

In 2017, Sanders wrote in the New York Times that, to win in 2018, Democrats should run on an agenda that was unapologetically far to the left. Led by then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), they did exactly the opposite. When the dust settled on Democrats' landslide victory, Sanders's political organization could not claim a single flipped seat in the House, while the moderate New Democrat Coalition claimed 31 of the net 40 red-to-blue wins.
Biden sees the U.S. at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges.

— Three prominent health-policy experts say Obamacare enrollment should be more automatic in order to help bring more people into the ACA marketplaces now that the individual mandate has been repealed. Because additional Americans are now likely to go without coverage, policymakers need to enact replacement policies to limit instability in the marketplaces, Stan Dorn, James Capretta and Lanhee Chen write in Health Affairs.
Democrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance.
The acrimony between the administration and House Democrats was on display Thursday in the House Judiciary Committee, which voted along party lines to empower Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) to subpoena acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker for his testimony should he not show up for a planned hearing Friday — or appear but not answer questions from lawmakers. Whitaker responded that he would not come Friday without assurances that he won't be subpoenaed. In turn, Nadler said in a letter Thursday evening that his committee would not subpoena him as long as Whitaker appears on Friday and is 'prepared to respond to questions from our Members.' Nadler tweeted shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday that Whitaker will appear before the committee at 9:30 a.m. Friday.
The request includes $1.25 billion in new funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the ability to transfer an additional $535 million set aside to fight Ebola and use it for the coronavirus response instead, Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Lena Sun report. The request reflects the fast-evolving nature of the crisis confronting the administration, which until recently had insisted that no additional funds were necessary. But Democrats immediately slammed the request as too small, with House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) calling it 'woefully insufficient to protect Americans' and criticizing the administration for trying to 'raid' money from other public health accounts.

Trump said he would drain the swamp, even as his personal lawyer sold access to the president for hundreds of thousands of dollars. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)
--Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the conservatives whose vote is in doubt, posted a video to Facebook yesterday saying he was frustrated with the process thus far. Lee said he's received numerous calls from constituents asking questions like when the health-care bill will be released to the public and why it isn't already public:
— A new poll out this morning from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans believe the recent wave of abortion restrictions that have passed at the state level aim to make access to abortion more difficult.
— Seven former FDA commissioners, nearly every one who has run the agency in the recent past, wrote in two newly published papers the FDA should become independent, Stat's Ike Swetlitz reports.
While Sen. Wagner's plan may be well-intentioned, it is neither well-conceived nor well- ­designed, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) and other GOP Senate leaders said in a joint statement Friday. Giving some Virginians what would amount to a $20-per-month tax credit provides negligible assistance when people are dealing with multi-thousand-dollar deductibles and outrageous monthly premiums.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the president provoked the insurrection. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump bears responsibility for the attack. Ten Republicans in the House voted to impeach Trump over it, and there was talk of asymptomatic cases in the ranks — Republicans who wanted Trump punished but weren't saying so out loud for fear of reprisal.
Bringing negotiation to Part B drugs is such a potent way to bring down prices that PhRMA is already protesting the idea, he said in an address at the American Enterprise Institute. This is really on their list of worst nightmares.
When the GOP's proposed overhaul of the nation's health-care laws was near death in the House in March, President Trump rallied 10,000 supporters in downtown Nashville and reassured his party's base.
This advice resonates with what I had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. And so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of Union Station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from Houston, Boston and Los Angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. Let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, Olowski says. That's not the Federalist Society's job. The Federalist Society's job is to put these ideas out there. And of course, as James Madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.
Trump's first year in office has shown us Democrats in lockstep opposition to his controversial nominees and to Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cut taxes for the wealthy. That apparent unity masks a steadily widening internal divide. Looking at the figure below, you can see that the Senate's ideological span is the widest in a generation.
What a crisis can do is change the political landscape so certain kinds of actions suddenly become possible and others become dangerous. That lawsuit was always a political disaster for Republicans, as much as they sorely want to see the ACA stabbed through the heart. It would now be even worse, but they can't drop it without admitting that they were wrong in the first place.
Despite its simplicity, the proposal never got serious consideration, Davis told The Washington Post on Sunday night. The problem is that it takes away the ability of one side to blackmail the other side. That's why it never goes anywhere.

Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during administration changes, Hayes said in the statement. The Obama administration dismissed the George W. Bush administration appointees to PACHA in order to bring in new voices. All PACHA members are eligible to apply to serve on the new council that will be convened in 2018.
It was not immediately clear if Wright has an attorney. She will be arraigned on Monday.
It totally eviscerates any integrity to their already pretty flimsy attack, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. This assault on Medicare lays bare the real Republican agenda, which is to destroy the health-care safety net. They have no shred of intellectual underpinning or integrity to their attack on Democrats if they make this kind of proposal.
The FDA also said it's almost halfway through an enforcement discretion period after warning the industry broadly in 2017 that it had three years to comply with its rules. So far, however, the agency says it's seen just modest progress by the industry to do so.
The measure is supported by health and youth advocacy groups but is likely to face opposition by tobacco and vaping industry groups, he adds. It could also face hurdles in a state where the tobacco industry has had a lot of influence.
Hickenlooper, Sanders spar on socialism: One of the sharpest dividing lines among the candidates surfaced early in the evening. Hickenlooper, an outspoken critic of the leftward drift of parts of the Democratic Party, warned that Democrats could be doomed if the GOP is able to define them all as socialists.

It's frustrating that these clinics are still operating, and surprising that authorities aren't moving faster — even now, Albini said. It was more than two years after his initial complaint to the FDA before a warning letter was sent to the company. Gottlieb said after he became FDA commissioner in 2017, he met with agency officials who put regulating stem cell clinics at the top of the list of priorities.
Republicans have held control of the Senate since 2014, but they won't hold it forever. It's possible that Democrats will take control of the Senate as soon as this November.

-- All quiet on White House front Tuesday night? At the White House, where the president assembled his relatively skeletal war Cabinet after nightfall, there was a vacuum of information. Officials were tight-lipped and bleary-eyed. The press secretary did not answer questions, only briefly ducking out of her office a bit before 9 p.m. to head home for the evening. A presidential address was considered but not delivered. Trump's Twitter feed, often a pulsating applause meter during live events, at first stayed frozen in time, report Phil Rucker, Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey. For a few hours, at least, with the United States at the dangerous precipice of a hot war with Iran, there was an outward appearance of calm at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. — or at least quiet.

Vice President Pence, who could break a 50-5o tied vote on health care should he need to, attended Tuesday's regularly scheduled policy luncheon, as he often does. But even as Pence represented President Trump at the crucial gathering, some Republicans have doubted the president's focus on the debate — which is another complicating factor on top of the many others.

Those Obamacare subsidies might have become less generous over time, but households would still be able to benefit from them as long as they were able to put up their share of the premium. By contrast, the limitations on funding for Medicaid could force states to cut the rolls to save money, leaving some consumers without any affordable options.

Even when those wins are uncertain or unlikely, members persist. We have to get something out of this, said Rep. Marlin A.

Peter Ben Embarek, a food safety expert and head of the mission, said that the most likely scenario is that a virus moved from a bat to an intermediate host to humans. He expressed skepticism about theories that the virus jumped directly from bats to humans or escaped from a lab but said everything was on the table.
But how and where the money is spent will make a big difference. As much spending as possible should go toward ensuring that the economy, when functioning normally, produces better outcomes for left-behind workers and communities. This will not happen naturally, as we can see from the recent experience of the recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The economy recovered, albeit very slowly, but the economic gap between dynamic large metropolitan areas and the rest of the country — particularly rural and small-town America — widened. Democrats did very well indeed in the former in 2020 but managed only very modest progress, and sometimes none at all, in the latter.
This is a fantasy, worthy of Four Pinocchios. Trump is obsessed with how he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and so he keeps making this claim even though there is no evidence to support it.
Filing down an escalator and onto the platform at Washington's Union Station, House and Senate Republicans smiled and largely avoided questions from the assembled members of the news media waiting to board their own trains. At one point, the words stepping on his own message could be plainly heard as a half-dozen Republicans filed past.
Sure, my he'd-rather-play-offense-than-defense explanation sounds simplistic. But that doesn't make it wrong. Simple explanations are often the right explanations, even though they seem unsophisticated.
In the case of the Fed, nominating Moore not only lets Trump dominate the news, but it could also be causing Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell, a frequent Trump target, to reach for heartburn meds.

There is no question that the American left and Washington Democrats are obsessed with their incandescent hatred of Trump, but that in no way excuses his own actions, said Michael Steel, the former spokesman for Republican Speaker of the House John A. Boehner. Saying the left hates Trump isn't a logical response to, 'Why won't you convict him for inciting a mob to attack the Capitol?'

A federal judge ordered attorneys for 9/11 victims to detail threats allegedly made against potential witnesses in a lawsuit targeting Saudi Arabia. The victims' attorneys have argued they need to protect the identities of potential witnesses, pointing to the murder of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi as an example of the kind of danger faced by those who speak out against the regime in Riyadh, Shayna Jacobs reports.
Andrew Yang: Well, it's gone up for a host of reasons. And a lot of that has been illegal immigration across the border. And so we need to enforce our borders in a real way. It's one of the reasons, one of the multitude of reasons why Americans have given up on government is because they feel like we have policies on the books, but then those policies aren't actually enacted in real life. This to me is one of the actual responsibilities of government is to say, Look, we can actually deliver on enforcing a southern border that lives up to its name like as an actual border. If we were to do that, then I believe the confidence level in the American people would increase immeasurably about immigration.

Democrats immediately seized on the administration's filing, calling it the latest attempt by Republicans to strip health insurance from Americans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday also unveiled Democratic plans for further bolstering the ACA.
Also mentioned was a recent rule change enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services exempting religious employers who objected to an Obama-era requirement that they cover employees' contraceptives. That is being challenged by several states.

The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better, the president tweeted on Tuesday morning. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!
Both parties — and especially the Republican Party — are increasingly driven by the more partisan segments of their membership. Indeed, three months after the 2013 shutdown, a Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that Republican voters supported the Tea Party at the same rate after the shutdown as before it, signaling that even as a majority of Americans disapproved of the Republican tactics that led to the shutdown, the core GOP constituency continued to show largely unwavering support for the party's most anti-tax politicians.

Candidates polling above 1 percent in three polls will get a shot at the stage. Those polls can be in primary states or nationally. At the moment, there's not much difference between the front-runners in either sort of poll.
There are 420,000 federal employees deemed essential, who are expected to come to work; essential government employees are those performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.
-- Has Trump's isolationist mentality hindered the U.S. government's response? When a group of business leaders in Davos last week asked about the coronavirus crisis, the president suggested the matter was a world away from the United States, CNN reports: Some of the assembled chief executives asked how Trump planned to confront the Wuhan coronavirus, which threatened to affect their global supply chains and spread into some of the world's most populous urban centers. Trump shrugged off their concerns, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
OOF: Lawmakers may have been exposed to the coronavirus during the Capitol lockdown, according to the Office of Attending Physician.
Trump says there are 76,000 illegal immigrants, but almost 53,000 of the total are family units, unaccompanied children or inadmissibles who present themselves at the border seeking asylum. It's a different situation from that of the mostly single men who tried to cross the border in large numbers in the early 2000s. Under Trump, the Customs and Border Protection agency has been releasing a combined total, but the inadmissibles — who numbered 9,653 in February — are not part of the apprehensions. Inadmissibles include individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.
Still, as negotiations began, Republicans were optimistic that conservative senators had already climbed down from the GOP's repeal-or-nothing positions of the Obama years, opening a tight path to victory.
Institute a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave office. (Trump signed an executive order, but it included significant caveats, including restricting officials from lobbying their former agency and leaving a relatively narrow definition of lobbying. He then rescinded that order, doing so overnight in the final hours of his presidency.)

In the short term, the aid Congress has already authorized must be pushed out with far greater urgency. As of now, it could take up to five months for some Americans to get their one-time relief checks. Independent contractors and the self-employed faced delays in applying for help under the program for small businesses. For the rest, rules were issued only at the last minute, and some borrowers fear banks are favoring existing customers.
After July, the number rose quickly.
That leads us to the other difference between his success in 2020 and his mediocre showing in 2018. Last year, Trump was also on the ballot, meaning a lot more Trump-loyal voters came to the polls. That helped him overperform polling in his own race but also aided his party down-ticket. In 2018, his endorsements were much less successful and, one analysis suggested, may at times even have served to disadvantage Republicans.

At an event in Trump's hotel in Las Vegas, he offers Romney that endorsement. The timing was important: The Nevada primary was looming, and Newt Gingrich had surged in national polling. The endorsement itself probably didn't make much of a difference, though: Romney won the state by 29 points over Gingrich.
There's no question that the American people need relief from Obamacare.... The big question is what we're going to do about it and why we have to act so quickly that we necessarily have to be voting on it next week, he continued.

Under Democrats' legislation, the IRS would send the payments to parents based on their income tax returns, marital status and child custodial status from the previous year. Singles who earned $75,000 or less the prior year and couples earning under $150,000 in the prior year would qualify for the benefit in full.
A similar approach is under consideration in the Senate. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who is working toward a compromise to protect the roughly 700,000 Ohioans with Medicaid coverage ­under the ACA, said he is open to either a temporary extension or another way to subsidize their health insurance. It's necessary to figure out how to provide coverage, and that's going to cost money, he said Thursday.
If I win, fine. If I don't, fine. But here's what you're going to get from me. You're going to get somebody that tells you exactly what I believe. And to everybody in this room, it's okay to be mad. It's okay to be upset.

The second, less politically conventional meaning of America Can Do Better is that we can be better Americans, present a better version of ourselves to the world. Said slightly different, the idea here is that we are better than Trump. Most voters, even some Trump voters, think he makes the country look obnoxious, racist, selfish and ignorant. Here's the invitation to restore some justified pride in America. We're not talking about Trump's empty braggadocio, but rather the gratification one derives from seeing one's own country stand up for the oppressed, treat immigrants (including refugees) generously, be a model democracy for the world, govern itself rationally with decorum, lift people from poverty and show a multi-ethnic, multi-racial democracy can function and prosper.

But the billionaire is making a calculated effort to cast himself as a health-care reformer in a race that has been characterized by vigorous debate over how to bring universal coverage to Americans.
Lots of economists have rejected Summers' inflation worries. As for the second argument, it's essentially a claim about political capital, an idea we really ought to do away with completely. It presumes that a president comes into office with a finite amount of capital he can spend, and passing one important bill reduces his ability to pass other important bills.
The message was, 'If you help this president achieve the greatest victory of his presidency, don't come running back to us for help,'  one official recalled. They were very direct, very forceful.
For the second time in eight months, Oregon Republicans walked out of the capitol, denying the Democratic supermajority a chance to pass a bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions. By absconding, the 11 GOP lawmakers prevented the quorum necessary to vote on the legislation and forced Democrats to adjourn for the day, Reis Thebault reports. It was the same tactic Republican lawmakers employed in June, when they fled to Idaho to avoid a vote on an earlier version of the same cap-and-trade bill, prompting Oregon's governor to call in state troopers to track them down and return them to the statehouse.

-- The crowded Democratic primary in Maryland's 6th Congressional District is pitting a female state representative against a self-funded business tycoon. From Paul Schwartzman: As a woman and an immigrant, state Del. Aruna Miller personifies the Democratic candidates dominating the 2018 midterm elections as she seeks to succeed Rep. John Delaney in Maryland and help her party retain the seat. But her chief rival in the race, businessman David Trone, is spending more than $10 million of his own money on his campaign, an amount that threatens to overwhelm any advantage Miller hoped to glean from endorsements from Emily's List and a trove of state lawmakers.

The Sarah Silverman Podcast shies away from celebrity guests, preferring to have the host interact with the listeners who leave voice mails. Some, she simply answers. Others, she has followed up on.
The truth of how all this would work is — shockingly — more nuanced than either side is charging. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.

In his address, Trump was plain-spoken and direct, a deliberate contrast to the poetic oratory of his predecessor. Four years ago, Obama delivered a soaring ode to modern liberalism, from climate change to social transformation. In advocating for same-sex marriage, he became the first president to utter the word gay in an inaugural address.
They are hellbent on dramatically increasing defense spending — but won't vote to authorize current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
-- Bernie hired David Sirota, one of his most notoriously aggressive online supporters to be a senior adviser and speechwriter. Since December, Sirota had been writing criticisms of Sanders's Democratic opponents on Twitter and in columns published in the Guardian without disclosing that he unofficially worked for the senator, the Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere reports: Sirota's hiring as a senior adviser and speechwriter was announced by the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning after The Atlantic contacted the campaign and inquired about the undisclosed role Sirota held while attacking other Democrats. Before the announcement, he deleted critical thousands of problematic tweets.

Green reassured the court that he could multitask given that another surgeon was helping him, but the judge was unconvinced. I don't think that's appropriate, Sacramento Superior Court Commissioner Gary Link said. The judge then asked the court clerk to come up with a different date for the trial.
Sheila Kelly, 56, a fundraiser for a nonprofit organization who lives in Exeter, is torn among Klobuchar, Buttigieg and possibly entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Outside Klobuchar's town hall, she said she's searched around online to research who might be strongest against Trump. She volunteered that she really dislikes when the term electability gets thrown around by pundits. I don't like where that leads, she said.
After Peter wrote in December about public health officials' failed response to the crisis, federal officials launched an audit of the city's opioid grant spending and Mayor Muriel E.

Can't know what they are, and then each time we check,
Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) has been shopping around a 200-page bill he introduced a few weeks ago that would revise the ACA but would also clamp down on hospital consolidation and mergers. Westerman's communications director Rebekah Hoshiko sent out a plea last week to a listserv of GOP staff to have their bosses consider signing on.
Even some members who won their seats partially on promises to repeal the ACA are blinking, citing changes to the proposed replacement that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to patients with preexisting conditions if their state got permission from the federal government.
Senate Republicans cannot afford widespread internal dissent. GOP leaders are hoping to use special budget rules to pass repeal by a simple majority vote, and even so, they can lose no more than two of 52 Republican senators.
I suspect that, right now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — a patient politician if ever there was one — is telling his troops not to worry. After all, a little more than a decade ago we faced an economic crisis, and though Democrats passed a large stimulus bill in 2009, the next year, Republicans took over the House and managed to hamstring the recovery by demanding austerity policies, all without paying much of a political price.
And National Geographic remembered Koko the gorilla:
nobody will be worse off financially under the House bill. Success, he said, means more people covered than are covered right now, and at an average cost that is less. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said yesterday thatunder the House bill. Success, he said, means more people covered than are covered right now, and at an average cost that is less.
And some mental-health professionals have stated they don't agree with Lee and others who worry about Trump's mental fitness. Dr. Allan Frances, a former chair of the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Duke University who helped revise the manual identifying mental illnesses, disagrees that Trump is ill. Confusing Trump's behavior with mental illness unfairly stigmatizes those who are truly mentally ill, underestimates his considerable cunning, and misdirects our efforts at future harm reduction. And the three most frequent armchair diagnoses made for Trump — narcissistic personality disorder, delusional disorder, and dementia — are all badly misinformed, Frances wrote for STAT in September.
Turnover, staff infighting and abrupt firings have been a trademark of the Trump administration since its earliest days, and that dynamic has not changed in the midst of the pandemic.
An overweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied about his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he personally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject.

A couple of generations ago, the entrepreneurship that would have occurred in a community would have been things like a flower shop, a hardware store, a toy store. Now, none of those businesses make any sense because the Internet has taken those costs down and the opportunities away.
OOF: The CDC is dramatically cutting back its epidemic prevention activities in 39 out of 49 countries because money is running out, government officials said yesterday. Four years ago, in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Congress approved a one-time, five-year emergency package to train frontline workers and strengthen laboratory and emergency-response systems. But in September 2019, CDC will run out of the $600 million it was awarded, and the Trump administration has not budgeted additional resources, Lena reports.
OUCH: A highly contagious variant of the coronavirus is expected to spread in the United States.
Trump now goes into the 2020 election strengthened and emboldened — the first president in U.S. history to carry an impeachment acquittal into a general election. For three years, Democrats threw everything they had at Trump. They accused him of bribery, extortion, campaign finance violations, obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress, abuse of power, conspiracy and even treason. Three years later, he's still standing — and thanks to impeachment, he may still be standing after the dust settles in November.
During our conversation at the Marriott Marquis, I noted that Democrats lost the House in 2010 after they passed the Affordable Care Act and that several congressmen lost their seats specifically because they walked the plank to vote for cap-and-trade system during the same Congress. Timing is everything — in comedy and politics, he said.
But that kind of effort wouldn't get far in the Senate. Republican lawmakers aren't even on board with more moderate proposals to provide Americans with a single government plan known as a public option alongside private insurance offerings (although such an idea is relatively popular with voters).

I don't believe public money should be spent on abortion, Mr. Hanna told the Post-Standard in Syracuse, N.Y., in 2012. But the idea that Planned Parenthood should not be funded? I mean, they provide about 20 percent of the female population with all of their health care. And they do it at a fraction of what the cost would be if someone showed up at a hospital emergency room.
Opposition to our current immigration system does not necessarily have to stem from xenophobia and racism: Polls from Gallup and Pew show that more than 60 percent of Americans have positive views of immigration but more than 50 percent worry that so much of it is illegal. High culture today is produced in liberal agglomerations like New York, Los Angeles and London, and it has created a kind of intellectual snobbery that is bitterly resented by people who don't like being dismissed as ignorant racists.
Nonetheless, Robert Herring has repeatedly shaped the news on OAN. During the campaign, for example, he banned stories about polls that showed anyone other than Trump in the lead, according to emails and interviews with OAN journalists.

However, the allotments would be less rigid than block grants, which have been advocated for years by many conservatives and decried by liberals for their potential to reduce spending over time, prompting states to cut benefits or eligibility, or both. (Block grants might still emerge from Congress as an alternative that states could choose.)

Then there was her response in mid-January after the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office determined the White House violated the law when it withheld nearly $400 million in assistance to Ukraine … Ernst dismissed the GAO findings as 'moot' because the White House did eventually provide the aid to Ukraine. … The message from the junior senator seems to be: It's OK to break the law as long as you later abide by it.

-- Politico Magazine, Lessons From the Fake News Pandemic of 1942, by Joshua Zeitz: Long before the advent of conservative radio, cable news and the internet—and two generations before an especially dim bulb shot up Comet Pizza in Northwest D.C. … 'fake news' pervaded the American South. It wasn't the first time that Americans consumed and spread conspiratorial rumors, but it was the first time that such rumors travelled so widely and targeted a prominent member of the first family. And it's also the historical example that echoes today's disinformation pandemic most closely. The example of 1942 also carries a warning. Many regions of the country were rife with rumor … but the South—with its weak political, civil society and educational institutions—was particularly susceptible to disinformation. Looking back from a distance, most Americans today would probably agree that the peculiar condition of the South in 1942 is not one that we wish to replicate seventy-five years later. But is our civil society today strong enough to resist?
Through the crucible of racial division, a global pandemic and massive economic hardship, 2020 has, paradoxically, presented the nation with a generational opportunity to finally achieve our country. We should begin with a presidential-level commission that will chronicle the tragedy of America's racial history with unvarnished clarity. Biden should embrace such a charge not because it will be easy, but because it is precisely the kind of difficult decision that bold leadership requires. The second part of the commission's charge should be policy remedies that will provide justice for Black Americans disproportionately scarred by poverty, punishment and the covid pandemic in our lifetime. Reconciliation, the part that too many Americans want to begin with, will come only after public expressions of truth and policy commitments to justice. A national Racial Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission would go a long way toward healing not only our racial divisions but restoring America's political soul. Peniel E.

The reality, as the Senate's Republican caucus came to understand, is something quite different: You can't lower health-care costs or extend coverage for some people without raising the taxes or premiums of everyone else. It's a zero-sum game.
-- Actress Annabella Sciorra, who played Gloria in The Sopranos, testified that Harvey Weinstein raped her more than 25 years ago. Shayna Jacobs reports: 'I was punching him. I was kicking him. I was just trying to get him away from me, and he took my hands and put them over my head,' Sciorra told the jury in Weinstein's sexual assault trial, her eyes welling up with tears and her voice breaking. … Weinstein, who had been watching her from the defense table, turned his gaze away from his accuser as she emotionally detailed the encounter. … In her five hours of testimony, she described freezing after the attack, adding that 'It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake.' She said she had no romantic interest in Weinstein. The film producer arrived at her Manhattan apartment uninvited one night.

Republicans' embrace of unemployment benefits marks a departure from the Obama years.

-- The Trump administration will create additional new hurdles for pregnant foreign women seeking U.S. tourist visas. The administration said it's trying to crack down on what it calls birth tourism, trying to reduce what conservatives call anchor babies, by instructing consular officers to assess whether women requesting tourist visas are hoping to give birth on U.S. soil, which would effectively grant their children American citizenship. Starting today, the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor visas to women hoping to travel to the country with the stated purpose of having a child. Foggy Bottom said consular officers cannot require pregnancy tests to make the determination but wouldn't rule out a woman's physical appearance when making the decision, per Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti.

He went to [Virginia Military Institute] in Lexington after graduating from James Blair High School in Williamsburg and has been a state senator since 1992. On one page of the yearbook, a student poses in blackface, surrounded by others in costumes at a party. Another page features a photo of two men in blackface holding a football. The N-word is used at least once, and a student listed as being from Bangkok, Thailand, is referred to with anti-Chinese and anti-Japanese slurs.

Barack Obama rolls into office with Mitt Romney's health care policy, with John McCain's climate policy, with Bill Clinton's tax policy, and George H.W. Bush's foreign policy. He's all these things not because the technocrats in his administration think they're the best possible policies, but because [White House adviser] David Axelrod and company say they poll well.
Maybe in this super-tribal atmosphere in which we find ourselves, the speaker just couldn't do it, Cleaver said. I don't know.
And the CMS position isn't the only top health-care slot Biden has yet to fill. He hasn't yet named a nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, or nominees for more than a dozen other key posts at HHS.
The TSA froze hiring and overtime pay as the spring travel season nears.
WALLACE: For -- for half a century, as you all know, Detroit was the symbol of America's industrial might: 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this city. At last count, there are now fewer than 30,000 manufacturing jobs here, and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent, twice the national average.
Other changes, aimed at Americans who have lost jobs because of the pandemic, would be just for the current year, anticipating that the economy might improve if the coronavirus fades after 2021.
Chelsea Clinton has had a modest presence around Philadelphia this week, having given birth to her second child with husband, Marc Mezvinsky, just a month ago. As always, her appearances are carefully managed. She talks slowly and deliberately about how becoming a mother has created a sense of urgency for her about the choices in this campaign. She refers to my mom frequently, implores people to vote and talks openly about pumping her milk for breast-feeding her newborn. Reporters can't get near her to ask a question.
The president's party will look for a real candidate in this race, with early speculation focused on former lieutenant governor John Sanchez and former Albuquerque mayor Rich Berry. But Democrats have a deeper bench, starting with Attorney General Hector Balderas, who lost a 2012 primary for the state's other Senate seat and has since become the state's strongest-performing Democrat statewide.
The Clintons have always been protective of Chelsea — to the point where many people didn't think they had a child when he first ran for president in 1992. When polling showed as much, a People magazine cover featuring the trio quickly appeared.
Did President Trump sink the re-election effort of South Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Sanford?:
TRUMP: I gave many people their money back. RUBIO: Then why don't you tonight say you're going to give the money back to everybody who wants...
During the debate last year about repealing and replacing the ACA, Republicans on Capitol Hill argued passionately about scrapping the health-coverage requirements. That repeal effort stalled, but CMS in October proposed a massive, 365-page rule suggesting an array of changes to how individual and small business plans are run.
Moreover, if we were to construct a value-weighted index of health insurance stocks, we estimate that these five companies would have 93 percent of the overall value. About 49 percent would just be one company – United Health.
Today, Grassley is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the panel that would be responsible for drafting a new health-care law, and he has shown little enthusiasm for Trump's call for congressional Republicans to produce a replacement for the ACA.
I think that having him in office has kind of emboldened racists in a way that has not been explicit since, like, the '60s, he said.
Yet the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that a straight minimum wage increase can't pass via the reconciliation process — the only way to pass a bill with a simple majority vote — the details of which are incomprehensible, or endlessly maddening, or both.
Neither did he endear himself to members of the anti-Washington tea party insurgency, whom he characterized as soapbox grandstanders. He cited a move in 2011 to cut off federal financing for NPR for its perceived liberal bias.
Environmentalists are shamelessly trying to impugn Ryan's character by flinging political mud. The bottom line is that Ryan's military and public service record is unbelievably laudable. He was a lieutenant commander of SEAL Team 6, awarded two Bronze Stars for combat, and four Meritorious Service Medals.
-- A Ukrainian passenger jet with more than 170 people on board crashed in Iran shortly after takeoff from the Tehran airport, killing all aboard. Isabelle Khurshudyan, Erin Cunningham and Sarah Dadouch report: In the aftermath of the crash, Ukraine has banned all flights from Iranian air space, a move also taken by several other countries in light of the rising tensions between Iran and U.S. forces in the region. The Boeing 737 likely crashed due to technical difficulties, Iranian state media quoted Ali Kahshani, a senior public relations official at the airport, as saying. Ukraine's embassy in Iran at first concurred, issuing a statement ruling out terrorism, but then took it down without explanation. A later statement from the embassy said that a commission is investigating the causes of the crash, and that 'any statements about the causes of the accident before the decision of the Commission are not official.' ...
While announcing his presidential bid in June 2015, Trump said he would save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. He added that it was not fair to make cuts to programs that people had been paying into for many years, and that he would save them by making us rich again and cutting waste, fraud and abuse.
Ike eventually wound up expanding Social Security eligibility. Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history, the president mused in a letter to his brother about the risks of taking away benefits that people have become accustomed to.
This is hardly the only option between sabotage and single-payer. For example, Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) have proposed a public-option plan that would make more incremental improvements to Obamacare. The point is that those advocating change can be both humane and practical.
The week-old Biden White House acknowledged Wednesday that most Americans will need to wait months to get vaccinated, as top officials launched regular briefings on their coronavirus response by seeking to illustrate their fidelity to science and transparency, Amy Goldstein and Lena H. Sun report.
She tells him: You're my president!
The resolution is largely symbolic, as the Republican-led Senate is not expected to advance the measure. Once again, House Republicans have shown that they are full accomplices in President Trump's campaign to destroy protections for people with preexisting conditions and take away Americans' health care, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement after the vote.
OOF: Some nonprofit hospitals are looking to patients for donations, using software and interactions with patients to determine potential large donors, Kaiser Health News's Phil Galewitz reports.
But it might not be enough: Poll results put Netanyahu's right-wing bloc two seats shy of achieving that governing majority in the 120-seat parliament, or Knesset, and breaking a year-long impasse in Israeli politics, our colleagues write. The prime minister's corruption trial is also schedule to start later this month.
Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores in malls, reducing the most common job in our economy, which is retail clerk. And the average retail clerk is a 39-year-old woman making between $8 and $12 an hour.
We had earlier spotlighted Harris's use of this spiel. She appeared to drop it from her stump speech the day after our fact check, but in recent weeks it has returned.
Kass, a medical worker who is running for the legislature with the backing of her district's retiring incumbent, subsequently expressed regret over her posts. The following month, the other committee members in the district endorsed her by a wide margin — at a meeting where a local Democratic officeholder sported a red Make American Great Again hat.
Direct the treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. This was a promise broken at first — and then suddenly kept. On April 12, 2017, Trump announced he would not label China a currency manipulator — something he had pledged to do on his first day in office. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China was not currently manipulating its currency, though that was already apparent during the election season. But then, on Aug. 5, 2019, he tweeted that China was manipulating its currency after the yuan fell below seven to the dollar, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs. The Treasury Department applied the largely symbolic label a few hours later. (This week, Trump dropped the designation ahead of a trade-deal signing, but we will note this as a promise kept.)
Trump signed a measure on Dec. 20 that raised the federal minimum age to buy tobacco products. The effort was spearheaded by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), in part to curb a spike in youth vaping.
— After trace amounts of asbestos were found in Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, the Food and Drug Administration is considering testing for the carcinogen in talc products, Reuters reports. Johnson & Johnson maintains its products are asbestos-free.
Like most of the bills passed by Energy and Commerce, the measures don't make any big, sweeping changes – or deliver big new funding — to the U.S. health-care system, which has come under heavy criticism for failing to deliver science-backed, medication-assisted treatment to far too many people struggling with addiction.
Another flash point is coming this winter: raising the debt ceiling, which sets the upper limit on federal borrowing. Without increasing the limit, the federal government — which must issue new bonds to cover its obligations — would likely default on its debt. Would either party refuse to provide necessary votes to raise the ceiling until their other legislative demands were met? Republicans tested the ceiling more than once during the Obama administration. It's unlikely but who can be sure?
If a daughter, sister or perfect stranger was raped, battered or needed help no one would ask or care what her ethnicity, national origin or orientation was before we came to her aid — nor should the Violence Against Women Act, Mr. Hanna said in a statement.
Proponents have said this would lower premiums for healthy individuals, but critics have argued that it would dramatically drive up costs for those who are seriously ill. Proponents also noted that states can choose to leave current mandates in place.

And enhancing Obamacare subsidies — a key part of how the Affordable Care Act made marketplace coverage more affordable for low-income Americans — could persuade more people to buy plans on HealthCare.gov, just as it opens for a special pandemic-related enrollment period starting Monday.
For renters, the Cares Act in most cases forbids landlords from evicting tenants for 120 days on properties secured by government-backed mortgages (though renters' credit scores could get dinged if their landlord reports them for non-payment). But that leaves 40 million renters without protection. Some municipalities, including Los Angeles, have passed laws temporarily banning evictions. Others, and some nonprofits, have launched rental assistance funds for residents struggling to make payments.
The Urban Institute calculates that the plan would help those currently struggling to afford insurance — and cover about 16 million additional people. Nearly half of those still left uncovered would be undocumented immigrants ineligible for the program.
The United States could also strengthen diplomatic bridges with other countries by giving them vaccine doses.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and others said in a letter yesterday that they'd look into whether Juul is violating regulations and promises made to the FDA ahead of Altria's purchase of a 35 percent stake in the e-cigarette company, CNBC's Angelica LaVito reports.
By extending the grandmothered plan policy, we are following through on our commitment to protect those left behind by Obamacare, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement.
Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, There's a lot of different timelines floating around.
We as a Republican Party have to get this passed, otherwise next term's midterm elections would not be a pretty sight, he said. When a good bill finally hits the floor would they really vote against it?
I have no problem with the approach of reforming the sentencing structure and I will faithfully enforce that law, Barr said.
Obama's shadow looms large in the minds of black voters in other ways that don't necessarily help Biden. David Swinton, the former president of Benedict College in Columbia, a historically black liberal arts college, said he and his wife already cast their ballots early for Sanders. We cannot be concerned about all the pundits who say he can't win, said Swinton. Let's not worry about that. Let's vote for what we feel in our heart, rather than who might win. Remember, nobody thought Barack Obama could win. And he did.
And I don't think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. They are interested in solutions, not slogans. It's easy to say, make things better, make things great. You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.
Obviously, Republicans argue that cutting taxes on everybody — including the highest earners — will unleash spectacular economic growth, lifting everyone's fortunes. Ryan argued that in his interview with Harwood. But this has frustrated some reform conservatives, who point out that the Republican Party still remains trapped in a 1980s fiscal worldview even as Trump is moving into the vacuum this has left behind by more directly addressing the economic concerns that struggling GOP voters are experiencing amid globalization and technological change. (Trump is pulling a scam here, since his actual policies aren't in sync with his rhetoric.)
When President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech.
Trump's move does seem to hand Democrats a potent issue against Republicans in House and Senate races in 2020. What about that? Well, those elections are more than a year and a half away. That's a lot longer than Trump's attention span or time horizon.
Once you establish that, based on an actuarial determination, that ratio wouldn't change, Rounds said.
The ways in which the court drove inequality were wide-ranging. In 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, it held for the first time that money is First Amendment-protected speech and struck down limits on spending in political campaigns. That began the dismantling of campaign finance laws, clearing the way for wealthy Americans, and then corporations, to use unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. In labor law, the court turned against unions — a trend that reached its nadir in 2018 with Janus v. AFSCME, which held that government unions cannot require nonmembers to pay fees for being represented in collective bargaining.
Last week, former president Barack Obama released a video message to supporters highlighting the upcoming 10-year anniversary of the ACA, saying that Republicans are still seeking ways rip away the care that millions of Americans rely on.
While Trump argues action is needed immediately to stem the influx of families at the border and, particularly, the number who then seek asylum in the United States., Americans haven't been entirely convinced of that urgency. A Post-ABC poll released in January found only a quarter of respondents reported believing situation with illegal immigration at the border was a crisis, with about half calling it a serious problem. A January Quinnipiac poll found that 54 percent of the country said there was a security crisis at the border, a result driven by broad support of the idea with Republicans.

Instead, he published what he said were emails from Enquirer executives to a lawyer representing de Becker. In one, top Enquirer editor Dylan Howard appears to suggest that the tabloid would publish a series of photos of Bezos and of Sanchez, some of them salacious, if AMI's terms weren't met. 'I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering,' Howard wrote, going on to say that the Enquirer had a 'below the belt selfie' of Bezos, among other shots. Howard added, 'It would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail — and quickly.' … Bezos's public letter seems to suggest that federal agents should investigate whether AMI may have violated the terms of its non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors in Manhattan over its role in the 2016 hush money payments to women who said they had extramarital affairs with Trump.
The law also sought to save money for seniors by filling in Medicare's drug coverage gap.
If Trump fails to secure the nomination, it is looking more and more likely that the nominee will be Cruz. The prospect of Cruz's nomination is a different matter than Trump's: It does not risk shattering the party of Lincoln, or destroying the party's best self. But it would hide that best self, placing it in storage until it would be dusted off again at some point in the (hopefully near) future, after Cruz loses the general election by a wide margin.
Trump is being very misleading here. His administration has continually tried to eliminate or reduce funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes that started under the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million a year under Obama. Trump's 2018 budget request would have zeroed out all funding — the administration wanted responsibility for funding local environmental efforts and programs to state and local entities — and his 2020 budget would have cut it by 90 percent. Notwithstanding Trump's proposed cuts, Congress appropriated nearly $300 million in 2019.
The deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the tea party, Bennet said, because it extended tax cuts put in place under President George W. Bush.
The symbolic measure and vote is another move to pressure Republicans on health care as the GOP scrambles to come up with a viable replacement plan for the ACA, Dan writes.
The new budget plan also calls for the creation of a high-risk insurance pool, a move meant to control the cost of plans for individuals and small businesses.
Read a selection of Krauthammer's writing, including this rumination from 2009 on being a columnist: Longevity for a columnist is a simple proposition: Once you start, you don't stop. You do it until you die or can no longer put a sentence together. It has always been my intention to die at my desk, although my most cherished ambition is to outlive the estate tax . . . To be doing every day what you enjoy doing is rare. Rarer still is to be doing what you were meant to do, particularly if you got there by sheer serendipity.

And sometimes, the standoff offers elected officials in Washington leverage, their only chance to demonstrate unyielding commitment to a particular cause and maybe even to score a win, however small.
By this summer, Republicans had hoped to wrap up health care, because that's when they need to start planning for next year's budget, which is due Oct. 1. They had hoped to use that budget process to pass tax reform — again under a budget rule that lets them duck Democrats' wrath.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Neidorff built up Centene by covering poor, disabled and pregnant individuals in state Medicaid programs, Zachary Tracer reports. The company has used many of the skills and strategies developed in that program in its ACA plans, including limiting where its members can get care to hospitals and doctors willing to accept lower reimbursement rates...The scrutiny of the company's provider networks could limit its expansion plans or reduce profits.
But many states, particularly those run by Democrats, won't pursue block grants. The most likely states to jump at the opportunity would be the 10 or so that have also pursued work requirements. And no states could make children, pregnant women with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, parents that fit certain income thresholds, and those with disabilities subject to the new requirements or funding restrictions under a block grant approach.
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is scheduled to host a guest lecture on the health risks of incarceration on Friday.
From an editor for Bloomberg News:
Pricey for sure, but he and his wife have concluded that it's cheaper than buying health insurance.
The CareFirst announcement is a worrisome sign for insurers facing deep uncertainties about the political and regulatory environment next year. When large premium increases were approved for 2017, many health policy specialists and supporters of the Affordable Care Act argued those were a one-time correction because companies had priced their products too low when they entered the nascent marketplace. A recent report by S&P Global said the ACA market was not in a death spiral and said that Blue Cross Blue Shield plans broadly had done markedly better in 2016 than previous years. The CareFirst rate request, which is not final, suggests that despite evidence the market is stabilizing, insurers in some areas are struggling and the flux around the future of health care is taking its toll.
And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
Unlike what we've seen this election cycle, such an effort might channel some of the anxiety that voters understandably feel about the present and the future into positive and productive directions. Such an effort might soften some of the harder edges of the electorate. Such an effort might make conservatism appealing to more Americans.
The company called the allegations blatantly false, after the 2017 warning letter. It has also pushed back on the FDA's lawsuit, per William and Laurie:
But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.
Mrs. Trump has a 12-year-old son, Barron, and has expressed her interest in children through numerous visits to hospitals and schools, the AP writes. She recently turned the Blue Room at the White House into a mock classroom and invited middle school students to share their hopes and dreams with her.
As a member of President Trump's defense team at the impeachment trial, Dershowitz used some variation of even if 10 separate times during his presentation to senators on Monday night. The emeritus professor at Harvard Law School – who has also defended clients like Jeffrey Epstein, Mike Tyson and Michael Milken – used that even if construction as he advanced provocative legal theories that are outside the mainstream of constitutional jurisprudence. Most notably, Dershowitz argued that it would not constitute abuse of power even if the House impeachment managers proved that Trump directly conditioned the delivery of military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for Volodymyr Zelensky on Kiev authorities announcing an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Dershowitz did this while dismissing the forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton, in which he reportedly writes that Trump told him of just such a linkage.
I'm just wondering if you can look ahead to the first few days, the first week and tell us what -- what to expect. I think you had said previously that he would sign some executive orders, executive actions on Friday. And in an interview that he recently did over the last few days, he said that he would get to work on things like that Monday. So can you just clarify that?
Throwing good money after bad, and so on
Klobuchar also gave an impassioned defense of people coming to this country. They are America, she said. We need their ideas.
Chyrons began to evolve as real-time fact-checks during Trump's 2016 campaign speeches — but more recently as a means to lift a rhetorical eyebrow over some questionable presidential statement or dramatic development. Trump himself reportedly pays close attention to the bottom-of-the-screen banners, watching them on a muted TV during meetings and reacting angrily when they trumpet another presidential scandal, outrage or faux pas.
Harris pressed the nominee, Under what scenario would you imagine that you would not follow the recommendation of the career ethics officials?
Merck's chief executive Ken Frazier said he'll be one of the pharmaceutical leaders who will testify at a hearing set for Feb. 26, Reuters reports. A spokesman for the committee did not say which other company had agreed to testify. AbbVie Inc, AstraZeneca Plc , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and Sanofi SA are the other companies invited.
Under questioning from Graham, Barr offered more insight into why he wrote a memo critical of what he thought Mueller's theory was on how the president obstructed justice, and with whom he spoke about it.
The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on drug pricing on Feb. 26.
What I would look for is . . . what's the burden on law-abiding people, and is it proportionate to whatever benefit in terms of safety and effectiveness will be conferred? Barr told Cornyn. As I said just a moment ago, let's get down to the real problem we're confronting, which is keeping these weapons out of the hands of people who are mentally ill.
Toward the end of last fall's campaign, Herring grew more open about his political leanings. He tweeted a pro-Trump logo promoting OAN's Encore online service, which streamed Trump's speeches on demand. Producers said Herring repeatedly urged against running stories critical of Russia. (Herring's online streaming company, KlowdTV, features a package offering just Herring's own channels and RT. Another package adds Glenn Beck's The Blaze and Newsmax.)
The budget would cut spending at HHS by 9 percent. Medicaid would receive nearly $920 billion less than otherwise anticipated by 2030. Meanwhile, a health reform vision allowance would lower spending on Obamacare by $844 billion over the decade. The budget request would also trim funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 16 percent. The president's health priorities – wiping out HIV transmission in the U.S. and battling the opioid crisis – would receive $716 million and $5 billion respectively. (Joel Achenbach, Laurie McGinley, Amy Goldstein and Ben Guarino)
After tweeting at Democrats, Trump then raised the debates, unprompted, during his meeting with Merkel.
Wolff also writes that Reince Priebus — the chairman of the Republican National Committee who later became the chief of staff — was alarmed how often during the transition Trump offered people jobs on the spot, including many he had never met before.
Romney joins other candidates in declining to participate in Trump's debate. Unlike Jon Huntsman — who tells Fox News that he was not going to kiss [Trump's] ring, and I'm not going to kiss any other part of his anatomy — Romney was polite.
The Trump administration is on board with an effort to, at a minimum, defang the agency by replacing its director with a committee that could mire it in the same kind of paralysis we see at agencies such as the Federal Election Commission. If your bank or your credit card company cheats you? You're on your own.
OOF: USA Gymnastics chief executive Kerry Perry told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee yesterday she was appalled and sickened by the despicable crimes of Larry Nassar and apologized to his hundreds of victims, breaking nearly six months of silence on the issue, The Post's Liz Clarke reports.
OUCH: GoFundMe said it would remove campaigns raising money to promote vaccine misinformation from its platform, the latest social media company to crack down on the spread of anti-vaccine information online.

And at a rally in South Carolina on Monday: [H]e campaigned on repealing and replace, we had all the votes, and perhaps he was grandstanding, who knows what he was doing? But you know what? He said, 'No, no.' Everybody said, 'What the hell happened?' He's been campaigning for eight years — repeal and replace. And he didn't do that.

Andrew Yang: Sure. So none of you had heard of me eight, 10 months ago, I'd imagine. And I'm sitting here having outperformed half a dozen sitting senators, governors, members of Congress. And so you have to ask yourself, how did that happen? And it happened because I'm laser-focused on the real problems that Americans see around us every day, many of which led directly to Donald Trump being elected. Right now, I'm fifth in the polls, rising, fastest-growing candidate or campaign in the race.
Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat still might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
Quite frankly, I'm willing to spend more money right now, he said. It's a very different thing in an emergency.
Moving ahead, Trump said that lowering drug prices is central to reducing health-care costs nationally — and that he will make it a priority as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Trump said that part of his approach would be public pressure just like on the airplane, a nod to his tweets about Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet, which Trump said was too costly.
The Senate bill would also provide funding in 2018 and 2019 for extra Obamacare subsidies to insurers to cover the cost-sharing discounts they're required to give the lowest-income patients. Insurers have been deeply concerned over whether the subsidies will continue, as the Trump administration has refused to say whether it will keep funding them in the long run.
• Kill the Keystone XL pipeline, the TC Energy Corp. project proposed to ferry 830,000 barrels of crude daily from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska.
Another possible outcome: If the pool of money is used to pay insurance companies for the difference in costs for patients with preexisting conditions, there may be little incentive for companies to keep their prices low; the difference would be made up by U.S. taxpayers.
The government already has more than sufficient statutory and investigative power to address white supremacist violence, including over 50 domestic terrorism-related statutes and a plethora of hate crimes, if it chooses to use them, Waheed said.
They aren't likely to create any major holdups as the relief measure moves through the House and the Senate over the next few weeks. Democrats are using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the need to get any GOP votes, since reconciliation bills require just a simple majority in the Senate.
-- Whitaker's hearing probably will be one of his final appearances as acting attorney general, Devlin Barrett and Karoun Demirjian note: The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Thursday to advance the nomination of William P. Barr to serve as attorney general, and the full Senate is expected to vote on confirmation next week.
Slavitt, who has become an outspoken critic of HHS under Trump, isn't totally pooh-poohing the idea, but he is a bit more skeptical. He listed some concerns with shifting the drug coverage, one being that 25 percent of Medicare recipients don't have a Part D plan -- but they still need access to medicines.
While the radical left has sweeping proposals for a total government takeover of the health system that will hurt seniors and eliminate private insurance for 180 million Americans, the Trump administration is working on real solutions that will provide Americans with the options and control they want and the affordability they need, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.
While most legal scholars think it is unlikely the Supreme Court will strike down the ACA should it ultimately hear the case, the lawsuit and the Trump administration's response frustrates many state leaders who have watched their uninsured rates decline as the ACA has become enmeshed in their systems.
-- The DOJ also charged four members of the Chinese military in connection with the hack of the credit reporting agency Equifax. Barrett and Zapotosky report: In a nine-count indictment filed in federal court in Atlanta, federal prosecutors alleged that four members of the People's Liberation Army hacked into Equifax's systems, stealing the personal data as well as company trade secrets. [Barr] called their efforts 'a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people.' ... The 2017 breach gave hackers access to the personal information, including Social Security numbers and birth dates, of about 145 million people. … Barr said China has a 'voracious appetite' for Americans' personal information, and he pointed to other intrusions that he alleged have been carried out by Beijing's actors in recent years, including hacks disclosed in 2015 of the health insurer Anthem and the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as well as a 2018 hack of the hotel chain Marriott. 'This data has economic value, and these thefts can feed China's development of artificial intelligence tools,' Barr said.
That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell, he added. It was a terrible deal for Americans.
Biden should focus on eliminating any obstacles that would prevent the opportunity for rebuilding, reconnecting and restoring our nation after the pandemic. The vaccine rollout will undoubtedly highlight the major inequalities in our health-care system. Who gets the vaccine first? Who gets tossed a mask?
It's a very small issue in 2026 but, potentially, a very huge issue by 2040, said Marc Goldwein, policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization that advocates reducing the federal deficit.

Lee is also one of the senators pushing a change to current legislation to insist that every state have at least one Obamacare-compliant insurance plan, in exchange for lifting the rules on the others. Short endorsed that change on Sunday, calling it perfectly appropriate, and part of the process of bringing everybody together.
We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. Grow the nation's economy by at least 4 percent per year, although Trump has also suggested he will boost growth to at least 6 percent per year — if not much higher. (Excluding 2020, growth in Trump's initial three years in office was 2.5 percent. That was narrowly above that of Obama.)
It gets harder from here, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation. Increasing subsidies is popular. The public option and lowering the Medicare eligibility age is going to run into buzzsaw opposition from the health-care industry.
There are some plausible reasons for the decline, such as an historically low unemployment rate and Virginia's recent Medicaid expansion. But the declines also come as the country's uninsured rate has started inching back upward – precisely the opposite effect intended by the writers of the ACA.
In other words: Poor people would be forced to pay more and receive less.
We did not pick Bernie last time because he was anybody's uncle, Uygur said. That primary was the most binary choice that anybody's ever had, between the establishment and a progressive. And now, there are lots of choices. If you think you can make a better progressive case than Bernie Sanders, then you should come on tomorrow. I'd argue that Hillary Clinton made a giant mistake by not coming on TYT and telling a progressive audience why they should come out and vote. That made all the difference in the world.
The strategy would allow Republicans who control the House and Senate to put just such a bill on the desk of a new president if their party wins the White House, without having to grind through months of budget process. To succeed, Republicans need the Senate parliamentarian to let them use rules set by a budget resolution into the next Congress.
Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are conflicted over how much to intervene. Some have urged a passive approach, saying it's best to let the marketplaces run their course since Republicans will soon replace the ACA anyway. Trump loves to predict that the law will collapse under its own weight:
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called it ridiculous that President Trump and Azar blame other countries that do have the power to negotiate lower drug prices for the high prices here. He said the U.S. government should be able to approach drugmakers and say it wants the same rates they give to other countries. Kaine said the U.S. government should at least set up a pilot program and try negotiating best prices on a few high-priced drugs.
Nonetheless, were the 2016 election to be held again, Pegues said that she'd probably again skip voting for Clinton.
Harris dodged a question about how Democrats would pay for the programs they're proposing by citing the president.
They accused us of doing nefarious things with this Lev Parnas character, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Sean Hannity. The truth is Adam Schiff and the Democrats have been doing nefarious things with Parnas!
Health insurance typically isn't such a patchwork system in other countries with wealth comparable to the United States. In Canada, Australia and many European nations, the government plays a far greater role in delivering coverage, keeping people's out-of-pocket costs low — and putting a damper along the supply chain on how much private industry can pocket from medications.
For now, the ACA remains intact — but expect the skirmishing over its future to continue.
I voted for him, and he's the one who's doing this, a government employee said to the New York Times about the president's embrace of a shutdown. I thought he was going to do good things. He's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.
— A state judge said a New York county can't block unvaccinated children from public spaces, a ruling that came 10 days after county officials put the controversial ban in place in an effort to address a major measles outbreak there.
If you've been laid off, your benefits usually end when you leave your job, which leaves you with two main options. You can keep your employer's plan for up to three years with a federal program called COBRA, but you have to pay for premiums yourself. (Learn more about COBRA here.)
If you think we are going to beat Donald Trump with all these plans, you are wrong, she said, a tacit swipe at several candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who have offered multiple policy proposals.
I recently sat down with Shalala to get her thoughts on Medicare-for-all, Obamacare, the Trump administration's drug pricing efforts and more. Shalala said she wants to reach universal coverage not with a whole overhaul of the system but through incremental steps, argued that Medicaid might be a better vehicle than Medicare for doing that and expressed optimism there will be bipartisan work to bring down drug costs.
Our proposals for reform are ambitious. But the deep-seated problems in our pharmaceutical system demand a vigorous response, not the paltry half-measures Trump has proposed. Lives are at stake.
In an era of partisan polarization, we tend to focus, appropriately, on conflict between the two major parties. But when polarization is high, even disloyal members of one's own party may face intense vitriol from their party's voters.
We have serious division. I mean, those divisions were on display last year during the campaign. They remain on display, Cotton said at the town hall. He sought to add a bipartisan note: That doesn't mean we don't work together on a case-by-case basis.
-- As deaths from the coronavirus topped 1,000, with more than 100 in a single day, China urged countries that have enacted travel restrictions aimed at curbing the outbreak to restore normal ties for the sake of the global economy. Simon Denyer and Rick Noack report: The comments from China's Foreign Ministry underscored the economic dangers posed by the unprecedented shutdown of much of the world's second-largest economy, as well as the Communist Party's concerns about the outbreak's capacity to fuel domestic instability. Authorities in the virus-hit city of Wuhan have announced fresh restrictions on residents, making millions of people virtual prisoners in their own homes. Two provincial health bosses have been fired as the Communist Party struggles to contain widespread anger over the spread of the virus. …
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has also been looking into the issue. He and other members (including Wagner) met last month with Ivanka Trump to discuss it, and is scheduled to speak on the topic next week at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.
CRUZ: The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America.
3. Trump said lawmakers should pass legislation prohibiting abortion midway through pregnancy.
2. It recently stopped billions of dollars of payments that help insurance companies afford sicker people: The Trump administration last month halted these payments to insurers, which help cover people who have expensive medical services. Like ending the subsidies for lower-income people, this could be disastrous to the insurance marketplace since insurers rely on this money. The Washington Post's Amy Goldstein reports the health insurance industry doesn't want these payments to end.
Republican lawmakers probably figure that there won't be consequences for their decision to jump to conclusions and yet again defend the president. The report is expected to be heavily redacted and may be hard for most people to read. Democrats in the House of Representatives are ready to go to court to try to get the full report, but that could be an uphill battle. Republicans' mind-made-up attitude sounds hypocritical as they criticize House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for still talking about potential Trump-Russia collusion. But who's really paying attention to that?
OPERATOR: And next, we'll go to Scott MacFarlane, NBC.
This is what the new Air Force One will look like:
The SSA would be much more efficient at delivering benefits to non-filers and poor families because parents already register children with the agency at birth, said Matt Bruenig, founder of the People's Policy Project, a left-leaning think tank.
Krauthammer now agrees with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) that the House GOP plan is Obamacare Lite, but he supports it anyway because he believes it is the best conservatives can hope for. I'm willing to admit it. Paul Ryan is not, Krauthammer told Bret Baier on Fox News last week. Get it while you can, and worry about the rest later.
Buttigieg appears to have been the second-choice candidate of Iowans whose first choice in the caucuses failed to meet the threshold qualifying them during the first round of those contests.
There are attacks that absolutely have negative impacts, there are gains that we are making and there are changes that are good for women that would actually be reflected in those numbers, Laguens said.
Investigators believe a former nursing assistant at the hospital gave the elderly veterans, most of whom were not diabetic, multiple, unauthorized injections of insulin that led to their deaths of severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, they write. The deaths, which are being investigated as homicides, are another potential embarrassment for leaders of the sprawling and long-troubled VA system, which President Trump promised to reform. Reverberations from the case have reached the highest levels of the Justice Department.
— Almost a dozen Democratic senators have launched a probe into marketing practices by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, seeking more information about the company and its deal with Marlboro maker Altria.
In Texas, one motion asked a federal judge to postpone a case challenging Obamacare because the lawyers were unable to prepare their opposition at this time due to the lapse in appropriations.
Unable to pass spending bills one by one, party leaders typically combine some or all of the bills into omnibus measures. While lawmakers craft these measures, Congress often adopts stopgap continuing resolutions, just as it did this week. CRs are nothing new; Congress lives on a steady diet of them, averaging five per year over the past two decades. In late 2000 alone, Congress passed 21 very short-term CRs to buy time while lawmakers finalized spending bills for the fiscal year that was already underway.
Wilson did apologize — but it wasn't enough to make people forget.
The breakout star of Barr's confirmation hearings isn't the attorney general nominee — but rather his grandson, Liam.
On Tuesday, Saunders said the decision to part with DeMint was difficult and necessary, adding that it will make Heritage stronger in the short term and the long run.
-- Democrats hope that, if they can block a Senate vote before July 4, the August recess will stifle GOP momentum and make it much harder to get final passage. The New York Times reports: Lawmakers would have just three weeks to pass a Senate bill and work out differences with the House before the planned August recess (assuming a bill passes the Senate). The Trump administration also wants Congress to raise the government's statutory borrowing limit before August, another fight that could collide with the Affordable Care Act repeal.
— House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), the head of the panel's Oversight subcommittee, sent a letter to major insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi calling for an explanation of increasing prices.
Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronnie Hawkins and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Ferriter are on the short list of contenders for the spot, joining Ron Nicol, a top adviser at the Boston Consulting Group (although a White House official said Nicol's chances of getting nominated are low, Peter writes).
TRUMP: ... When they got the information it became an A...
Even among those who approved of Trump's job performance overall in that CNN poll, nearly 3 in 10 opposed the family separation policy.
And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education. I assume you wouldn't cut those things. The entire budget for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, $8 billion.
Yang's basic pitch is simpler than anything offered by other Democratic candidates and has been rattling around think tanks and the TED Talk circuit for years. If elected, Yang would work to create a freedom dividend of $1,000 per month for every American over 18 years old. It would be paid for by consolidating some welfare programs — which programs are TBD — and a small value-added tax on consumer goods. If poorer Americans wanted to stay on their current social welfare programs, they could, or they could get the monthly check.
Wolff says that his book is based on 200 conversations over the past 18 months with Trump, most members of his senior staff, some of whom he talked to dozens of times, and many people with whom they had spoken. Some conversations were on the record, while others were off the record or on deep background, allowing him to relay a disembodied description of events provided by an unnamed witness to them.
But Blahous dismissed the $2 trillion in savings as unrealistic, since it would only occur under assumptions of dramatic reductions in drug prices and administrative costs, as well as the 40 percent drop in provider payments for those receiving private insurance.
Tuesday. The House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation holds a hearing on VA logistics modernization on
Gottlieb said he finds the practice so pernicious because it undermines the U.S. system of market-based drug pricing.
Endorsements aren't a guarantee: Candidates who back other candidates are traditionally viewed as also pledging the support of their delegates, but there's nothing requiring a delegate for a candidate who drops out to support whomever that candidate has endorsed.
Inslee secured investments in clean-energy research, pushed to increase electric vehicle use in the state and co-founded a coalition of 17 governors working to uphold the Paris Agreement on climate-change goals. Energy related greenhouse-gas emissions in Washington declined 3 percent since their pre-recession high in 2007, despite population growth and the nation's fastest economic growth in recent years. Emissions are expected to fall 5.5 percent by the time Inslee's current term ends in 2020 … He's been a strong advocate for private- and public-sector research and advanced product development. That includes championing state support for Boeing's development of cutting-edge, fuel-efficient jetliners.

I watched porn all night because I couldn't believe I could see naked people having sex, Silverman said. Only to find out that it was all on the record.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.
I will say, though, in terms of immigration -- and almost anything else -- there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal. And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did. He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something. In the meantime, what came of it? Nothing. You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.
Fred Hiatt: Also in the world, Abby in Woodstock, N.Y., asked, how would you handle nonstate terrorist groups like ISIS while getting us out of forever wars?
And the tweet served as a warning shot, with battles still to come on issues such as taxes and infrastructure that threaten to further expose Republican fractures, that Trump will not hesitate to apply public pressure on those in his party he views as standing in the way.

In contrast, the survey found incremental improvements in this area among people who bought insurance on their own — even though Democrats have charged the opposite would be true. Forty-two percent of people purchasing individual market coverage were underinsured last year, compared with 44 percent in 2016, before Trump took office.
Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.
He said that his memo was narrow in scope, explaining my thinking on a specific obstruction-of-justice theory under a single statute that I thought, based on media reports, the Special Counsel might be considering.
In today's speech, which is expected to last about 25 minutes, Azar will stress the multiple steps his department has taken to tackle the drug price problem. The secretary is expected to point to a promised initiative to link certain Medicare drug prices to lower prices found in other countries and an earlier proposal requiring drugmakers to display list prices in television ads. HHS proposed the rule on television ads last fall, but has yet to formally propose a regulation on the new drug pricing index.
The first weeks of the Biden presidency show the path Democrats can take: Push forward with the popular and consequential parts of your agenda, don't be distracted by bleating from Republicans, act as though the public is behind you (because it is), and you might find that the Republican opposition machine isn't as potent as it used to be.
Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, a close Trump ally, said recently that the president has kept his 2016 campaign promises except when it comes to illegal immigration and border security.
Several plastic surgeons pleaded with the panel to proceed carefully, saying that implants generally are safe and an important option for women who want breast augmentation or reconstruction after breast cancer surgery, Laurie writes. They said that women's choices should not be curtailed.
Christopher Ruddy, the Newsmax Media chief executive who is a friend of the president, said the lesson learned within the White House is to be more careful moving forward when it comes to trusting Congress and the leadership's whip counts.
The company also said it will try to prevent prescription fraud by requiring e-prescriptions for controlled substances starting in 2020. The new policy announcements follow a recent CDC recommendation. A CDC study found that people who were prescribed at least one day of opioid therapy had a 6% chance of being addicted a year later — but for those prescribed eight or more days of treatment saw that chance spiked to 13.5%, Danielle writes. The CDC also notes that patients who are prescribed higher dosages are more likely to die from an overdose.
I think the president has been using the bully pulpit, Short said. The left clearly has been organized in their communications effort against the bill, and collectively Republicans have not messaged the benefits of the bill effectively.
Drug industry groups panned the idea, as did the Canadian government, which warned of shortages for its 37 million residents if the United States imports its medicines on a large scale.
It's also worth noting what Kavanaugh has said. When he faced allegations of decades-old sexual assaults during his confirmation, he offered a thoroughly political broadside against the Democrats who opposed him. He said they had engaged in a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. He also told them, You sowed the wind for decades to come and I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind — a comment that Schumer's remarks Wednesday appeared to recall.
The president's focus this week and in coming weeks, until it's passed, is on the American Rescue Plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. It's absolutely critical Congress act, and we certainly hope they do that as quickly as possible.
So how about Culinary Workers-Care-for-All? The union couldn't object to that, could it?
But reform talks have stalled in recent years as negotiators get hung up over which deductions and credits to eliminate in order to make up for revenue lost from cutting rates. That's because many of the big-ticket tax benefits — like the state and local sales-tax deductions and the research and development tax credit — also have major constituencies that lawmakers don't want to offend.

The decision is a huge blow to Democrats — and not just because he was one of the few GOP senators open to witnesses. It's also because he is retiring ahead of the 2020 election — a move that would ostensibly have given him more latitude to take a tough vote. He comes from a red state, yes, but he was also a vote Democrats desperately needed.
TRUMP: I don't know exactly what -- when you talk about off the record. First of all, Buzzfeed? They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president. And were they wrong. But a lot of people said that.
BAIER: Gentlemen, the next topic to discuss is terrorism. Senator Rubio, ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook. We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country. You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq...
Don't go wobbly — Mrs. Vogel, stand firm on Medicaid, an editorial in that paper implored Thursday.
As part of a rules package for the new Congress, the party voted to granted itself the authority to intervene in the lawsuit, and scheduled a vote for this week designed to force GOP lawmakers into a political corner: agree to defend a law many members have spent years reviling or appear to oppose popular ACA protections for millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions that many have pledged to uphold, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.
Stone's defense on Monday asked for a sentence of probation, citing his age, 67, and lack of criminal history. They also noted that of seven Mueller defendants who have been sentenced, only one faces more than a six-month term: former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is serving 7½ years. ... Hours before the filing was due Monday, the new head of the D.C. office, interim U.S. attorney Timothy Shea — a former close adviser to Attorney General William P. Barr — had not made a final decision on Stone's sentencing recommendation … Disagreements among prosecutors about sentencing recommendations are not uncommon, especially when it comes to politically sensitive high-profile cases. It would have been unusual, however, for the U.S. attorney's office to endorse a sentence below the guideline range after winning conviction at trial...
— Meanwhile, the company is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy amid potential liabilities in more than 1,600 lawsuits against the manufacturer, alleging it contributed to the opioid crisis.
Justice Clarence Thomas cited himself in arguing to overturn a decision he authored.
-- Chairman and partisan: The dual roles of Devin Nunes raise questions about House investigation, by Greg Miller and Karoun Demirjian: [The House Intelligence Committee chairman] was on his way to an event in Washington late Tuesday when the evening's plans abruptly changed. After taking a brief phone call, [Nunes] swapped cars and slipped away from his staff, congressional officials said. He appears to have used that unaccounted-for stretch of time to review classified intelligence files brought to his attention by sources he has said he will not name. The next morning, Nunes stepped up to a set of microphones in the Capitol complex to declare that he had learned that U.S. spy agencies had 'incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.' Nunes has said he is committed to leading an impartial inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election. But [he has] also at times used his position as chair of the intelligence committee in ways that seem aligned with the interests of the White House.
Good luck getting Trump to clarify what he wants in the replacement! Trump doesn't want to be the guy who kicks millions off coverage, but Republicans won't support anything that doesn't do that.
Over the weekend, President Trump hadn't helped. In an interview on CBS News's Face the Nation Sunday, Trump said the latest bill would beautifully protect those with preexisting medical conditions — which is not fully true.

In other words, these results cannot be applied to all Texas teachers; they only reflect the answers of the people who decided to answer the survey.
-- Twelve years ago, Buttigieg spent the final week before the 2008 caucuses in rural southwest Iowa, trying to turn out voters for Barack Obama in one of the most conservative towns in the state. Holly Bailey spoke with him about what he learned: 'This was a new experience to really talk to people like this,' Buttigieg recalled. 'And what I found was, first of all, you can't assume where somebody is going to be. We were in an area where a lot of people weren't Democrats to begin with, and those who were were more likely to be for [John] Edwards. But they would hear us out when we were talking about Obama. And sometimes, as you do when you go door-to-door, somebody, because you represent a presidential campaign, would just pour out everything that was on their mind, everything they were upset about.
-- It will be a bit warmer today, but prepare for likely rain. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Spring officially arrives this evening, at 5:58 p.m. to be exact. But Mother Nature isn't ready to bust out with the season quite yet, although today is a bit warmer than yesterday. It's been a while since we've seen rain, so perhaps midweek isn't the worst time, with rain likely tonight and tomorrow. Friday and Saturday stay cool with a gusty breeze, before what should be a splendid Sunday.
TRUMP: We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.
The hang-ups: The money. (Always the money.) On disaster relief, it may just be too expensive for a majority of Congress to stomach. Before the holiday, the House approved $81 billion in disaster relief, but Democrats said that was not enough, given places like the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico still do not have power. One Texas congresswoman, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), has said she thinks recovery from Hurricane Harvey alone will cost $150 billion.
That someone was South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson — and now, eight years later, an indignant crowd at a town hall has returned the sentiment.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.
Senate Minority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) said the Senate Republican Caucus was in mourning. Members extended condolences to Chafin's mother, wife, three children, grandchildren and sister, state Supreme Court Justice Teresa M. Chafin.
The president shouldn't use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack, Pelosi tweeted.
Betsy has been endorsed by over 20 former governors, former secretaries of education, Barbara Bush, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and many others. They praised her compassion for children, her impressive record of championing education reform. And she has incredible broad support from local leaders, who worked with her to improve access to education for families in Michigan.
On the trail before last year's midterm elections, Democrats campaigned aggressively on health care, attacking Republicans over their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The dynamic marked a shift from the two previous midterm elections, during which the GOP was the party mainly going on offense on health care, slamming Democrats over the creation of the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
To my fellow Republicans who hope that Trump's departure from office will end this cycle, I would remind them that it started long before he descended the escalator in Trump Tower more than five years ago. And left unconfronted, it will continue long into the future.
I think it's clear the kind of level of racism that exists in the country, Cohen said, and I think he's united certain populations against him that I think is important, for instance the women's movement. But it's at great cost.
A joint statement from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and other patient advocacy groups: The Court's decision today will leave millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions and those who rely on federal tax credits to obtain coverage unsure about their ability to keep or afford comprehensive health care coverage for months to come.
The drug industry hates the idea, since it generally gets paid more for drugs covered under Part B than under Part D. Drug companies have serious concerns this idea would limit patient affordability and access, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America executive vice president Lori Reilly said on Tuesday in the lobbying group's first public remarks about the proposal.
There is no family that Republicans distrust and dislike more than Bill and Hillary Clinton. Their longevity in politics -- and the fact that Bill Clinton managed to win, politically speaking, despite being impeached -- sticks in the craw of lots and lots of GOPers.
The Trump thing was a gamble, apparently based in part on the idea that once Trump faltered -- as was inevitable! -- Cruz could scoop up his followers. In effect, what it allowed Cruz to do was hold onto a base of support that he built in his first Senate race and then expanded during the Hill fights against Obamacare that led to the shutdown. Trump didn't go after him, which likely helped Cruz as his team tried to expand that core of support outward.
The man is just a proponent of change, continues Huling. By calling for Medicaid expansion Warnock is simply asking America to live up to its ideals, he explains. If that is radical, says Huling, then we need more radicals.
-- Bigger picture: The sudden departure of [Bharara] raises uncertainty about the federal government's approach to trying financial crimes and global terrorism cases, even as it isn't likely to change the course of several high-profile investigations, the Wall Street Journal reports on the front page. The Manhattan U.S. attorney has wide jurisdiction in prosecuting financial crimes and other white-collar cases, and prosecutors in that office have been particularly aggressive in charging and arresting people outside the U.S. for federal crimes like terrorism, sanctions violations and cybercrime. The firings don't force pending investigations across the country to be put on hold, as U.S. attorney's offices have career prosecutors who will fill in until new ones are confirmed. In Manhattan, Mr. Bharara's departure is unlikely to have a significant impact on continuing probes, largely because the interim leader of the office, Joon Kim, is a close friend and longtime colleague of Mr. Bharara's.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: Former prisoner of war John McCain on Otto Warmbier's death: Let us state the facts plainly: Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, was murdered by the Kim Jong-un regime. In the final year of his life, he lived the nightmare in which the North Korean people have been trapped for 70 years: forced labor, mass starvation, systematic cruelty, torture and murder ... The United States of America cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers.
Following this meeting, the president will meet -- will hold his second meeting, for those of you who were out at Bedminster, with Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong -- last name is S-O-O-N hyphen S-H-I-O-N-G. Their first meeting, as I noted, was in Bedminster with the president-elect and the vice president-elect.
As for Democratic incumbents and Democratic challengers up in 2020, the choice between nothing and Obamacare-plus will provide the stark contrast they seek to make with Republicans.
Then came the shutdown. The Post reports, While Trump's relationship with much of his base remains strong, two years after his inauguration his ties are fraying with voters . . . who voted in droves for Trump in key pockets throughout the industrial Midwest, flipping previously Democratic states to him in 2016. Now, The shutdown fight, as it has played out over the past month, is further eroding the president's support among voters who like the idea of beefing up border security — but not enough to close the government. Suddenly Trump's destructive tendencies don't seem amusing:
Farmers could turn quickly: Ernst also said that Trump is on the verge of alienating his most loyal supporters over unsettled trade disputes with China, which has imposed crippling tariffs on U.S. soybeans, corn, and wheat along with whopping retaliatory tariffs on ethanol and pork products.
In 2015, Roberts and the court's liberals were joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is now retired, in upholding the law against another challenge. It involved tax subsidies.
As a result, the continued uncertainty makes it difficult for us to offer Individual health plans statewide in Virginia, its statement said, announcing that it will leave the marketplace, where people can buy insurance plans with the help of federal subsidies.
Similar requirements have already been imposed on recipients of welfare and food stamps, though the Obama administration in 2012 gave states more flexibility on welfare's work requirement, Aaron writes. That requirement was initially part of the Clinton administration's welfare reform efforts in the mid-1990s, and it was overwhelmingly popular at the time.
Tax reform is a perennial topic for Republicans who argue that high tax rates, a complicated filing system and antiquated business rules are creating a drag on the economy.
I'm an old man so it won't affect me, but I shudder for youth, he added.
Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-Ore. ) has hinted at his support for scrapping the filibuster entirely but has geared his efforts toward a talking filibuster and other potential options, his spokesperson told Power Up.

-- There are hospitals in every congressional district, and they are mobilizing in a concerted way against Ryan's plan. All of the major hospital groups, including the American Hospital Association and those representing children's hospitals and psychiatric hospitals, came out against the new legislation, USA Today notes this morning.
OOF: House Democrats introduced a resolution on Friday condemning White House support for the lawsuit striking down the ACA, Politico's Dan Diamond reports. A spokesperson for Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), who introduced the measure with support from House leadership, said the party is planning a vote as early as Tuesday.
Van Hollen vastly outspent his rival, $6.3 million to $2.7 million.
But a bloc of 30 conservatives refused to back down and joined all House Democrats to vote against the bill, killing it.

[CBO report could prove pivotal for Senate Republicans' health-care bill]
--A Yale psychiatry professor briefed more than a dozen members of Congress last month on Trump's recent behavior and what it could indicate about his mental health, Politico's Annie Karni reports. Lawmakers concerned about the president's mental state invited Yale University professor Dr. Bandy X. Lee to Capitol Hill for a two-day session attended by all Democrats except for one unidentified Republican senator.
For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.
It's no mystery why the formula changed — Democrats now control both chambers of Congress. When Republicans muscled through a tax bill in 2017 when they controlled both chambers, the law was written to eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes, which disproportionally hurt residents in blue states.
Ahead of his 100th day in office, which he will mark this month, Trump has struggled to build a governing coalition that matches the nontraditional alliance that put him in the Oval Office. And he has turned to making enemies of former partners among Republicans in Congress, even as Democrats keep him at arm's length.
What interests do we have in the Middle East?
A few minutes after 9:30 a.m., Graham gaveled in the hearing and turned the mic over to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), his predecessor as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Some experts suggested that Republicans were trying to conceal the significance of the change. After all, it is just one letter.
Today, Kennedy's grandson, Rep. Joe Kennedy (Mass.), speaks eloquently of a new, more moral version of American capitalism, one that is judged not by how much it produces but how widely it shares it, and how much good it does for how many.
If there's a silver lining for Romney, it's that he hasn't seen quite as much erosion among his home-state Republicans as he has nationally. But even there, he's not in a great position. A poll last month showed 40 percent of Utah Republicans approved of him, while 49 percent disapproved. His overall approval rating was 50 percent, again indicating he was more popular outside his party than in it. (Romney doesn't face reelection until 2024, though.)
But the other guy's there, too. And I don't like him any more than you do, Graham said — in an apparent reference to the fiery persona that came out during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Jo-Ann Armao, associate editorial page editor: So do you ever run into people who say, Hey, you know, we tried to nontraditional like last time with Donald Trump? That didn't work out so well, so I'm a little bit leery about you?
While one theory holds local reporters are more easily dazzled by the White House, in practice they can be just as nettlesome as the regular press corps. After one tense back and forth in 2011 with WFAA-TV of Dallas, an ABC affiliate, Obama warned him: Let me finish my answers the next time we do an interview, all right?
In a statement, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called it good news that at least some Republicans are facing reality and accepting that families don't want any part of Trumpcare.
Barr also said he does not know of any other examples of potential interference in the Mueller probe, although he noted that he is not privy to nonpublic information about the special counsel investigation. And when asked whether Mueller could handle any instances of interference with his probe, Barr responded: He's a Marine.

The plan also calls for about $40 million — half of that federal matching funds — to help people comply, as the state already does for certain welfare recipients.
Yes. Yes, that's what I meant. I'm sorry.
The estimate Trump is citing comes from a Republican-aligned think tank; it's actually $93 trillion, and it factors in things that are not in the resolution, such as building high-speed rail at a scale at which air travel becomes unnecessary.
To unwind policies finalized under the Trump administration, HHS (and other federal agencies) must go through publicly posting the proposed changes and allowing enough time for public comments. This process can take months or even years, depending on how complicated the regulation is.
As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law's insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion.
Northam, who ran as a consensus builder, has signaled he would rather not have to muscle something as consequential as Medicaid expansion through the amendment process. And some Republicans have said they would rather not give Fairfax, a likely contender for governor in 2021, the resume-boosting opportunity to cast the deciding vote on Medicaid expansion, which polls well with voters.

KELLY: OK, no, but -- standby. But, what happened in that case was you counter-sued her. The court threw out your counter-suit, and made you pay almost $800,000 dollars in legal fees of hers, and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University. And, that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder...

Trump claimed credit for the provision, though it was pushed by Democrats who have long criticized his administration for not doing enough to protect the uninsured. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, Trump tweeted on Friday.
So the question is, how do we get into the guts of these tech companies and protect our kids from having their brains changed in ways that are quite negative? If you were to go around saying break up Big Tech, break up Big Tech, that actually does not change the mechanics of the social media app. You have to have a Department of the Attention Economy with very smart people like Tristan who go in and actually say, Look, here are the 20 design decisions you made. You're going to make them all differently. So saying you're going to go around breaking up Big Tech is a pretend solution. It's a 20th-century solution to 21st-century problems. If you home in on the actual problems you're trying to solve, you see you need a different approach. You need a scalpel, not a sledgehammer in many of these cases.
Azar named payment reform as a key goal last year, along with lowering drug prices, combating the opioid epidemic and making health care more affordable. But designing payments so that doctors are rewarded for quality instead of quantity – and persuading them to participate in new methods of payment – is no small task.
In a 240 to 186 vote, the Democratic-led House passed a resolution calling on the Justice Department to halt its new advocacy for abolishing the Affordable Care Act, a move the measure calls 'an unacceptable assault' on Americans' health care, our Post colleague John Wagner writes.
In the end, the 2016 test repeal-replace legislation passed with the individual mandate intact but with a $0 penalty if you don't have health care.
I'll just quote Winston Churchill, he said. Americans will always do the right thing after they've exhausted all the other possibilities.
But for now, McConnell — who can afford to lose up to three votes while retaining a working majority — has the support he needs to call the shots. The political calculus on McConnell's home front offers him little room to compromise, even if he wanted to.
So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
— For the first time, House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare for all, a step that comes as Pelosi has backed the process, as our Post colleague Dave Weigel reports.
A Guardian reporter noted this tweet from one of Bernie Sanders's campaign aides:
Many of the people who are now prominent in the Trump administration attended our conferences, even spoke at our conferences, read our publications, Heartland Institute President Joseph Bast told The Post. I think we're seeing the fruit of a decade of hard work on this issue.
—And here are a few more good reads:
Sometimes, her avoidance of reporters seemed a bit surreal.
The state party changed its caucus rules for 2020 because Sanders supporters felt the old rules were unfair to them. Iowa used to report only the number of delegates each candidate won, rather than the number of supporters each candidate had. Since delegates are doled out geographically, this meant candidates who ran up a lot of support in urban areas and college towns looked less popular than they actually were. Too, a candidate who barely missed the viability threshold was indistinguishable from one who got only 1 percent of the voters — and in a crowded field, that matters.
In a snub, the House and Senate did not send a delegation of lawmakers to the governor's ceremonial office in the Capitol to report that they had adjourned, as is customary. [Ralph] Northam had let them know earlier Sunday that 'he would be ready to receive them,' spokeswoman Ofirah Yheskel said. Northam got a half-hour's notice that they would not be coming. … Just 15 minutes after gaveling out, House Republicans launched a YouTube ad that spliced national coverage of the Democratic scandals with local TV reports on Republican plans for school safety, tax cuts and autism. 'Virginia's choice is clear: chaos and embarrassment,' a female narrator says, 'or leadership and results.'

I do not care for Trump at all, she said. Not a Trump supporter. I don't support what he stands for — especially when it comes to women. He believes that women are beneath him, and me being a woman and a single mom, that's not anything I can support.

The suit was filed the same day thousands gathered at the Staples Center to remember the victims.

-- Two months out of office, Barack Obama is having a post-presidency like no other, by Krissah Thompson and Juliet Eilperin: So far, Obama is ... keeping things low-key, despite clamoring from Democrats for him to do more. ... Obama is delegating political work to associates — notably former attorney general Eric Holder, whom he has tapped to lead the redistricting project that aims to help Democrats redraw legislative maps … [And] his first major speech as a private citizen will come in May, when he will be awarded a [JFK] Profile in Courage Award as part of a celebration of Kennedy's centennial. [But] unlike other former first couples, the Obamas do not necessarily have to take to a podium to make a statement. They know their every public movement is plumbed for meaning … To escape the spotlight, the Obamas have taken multiple vacations since leaving the White House — to Palm Springs, the Caribbean and Hawaii. After meeting with tech executives about his presidential center recently, Obama headed to Oahu, where he golfed with friends and dined at Buzz's Lanikai steakhouse in Kailua. Three days later he jetted off in a Gulfstream G550 to Tetiaroa, a South Pacific island once owned by Marlon Brando. He plans an extended stay there to start writing his White House memoir. … Few believe the Obamas plan to stay in Washington beyond their daughter Sasha's 2019 graduation from Sidwell Friends School.

Last year's gubernatorial race offers a cautionary tale of what happens when a Kentucky politician, even a Republican one, takes the state's conservative voters for granted.
There, Cotton and other Republican senators will have to grapple with forces pulling them in different directions: their own promises to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act; the reality that many of their home states are filled with constituents who have benefited from Obamacare; and the perilous challenge of negotiating with Trump, who has shown a willingness to lash out at unruly Republican lawmakers.
And the law's insurance marketplaces appear more stable than ever before, with enrollment remaining relatively steady between 2019 and 2020. About 8.3 million people signed up in the 38 states that rely on Healthcare.gov, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last month — a dip of less than 2 percent compared with last year.
--Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is striking out on his own to try to sell universal health coverage to the American public. On the evening of Jan. 23, Sanders will host a 90-minute national town hall' online, with no major network behind it, The Post's Dave Weigel reports. Instead, the event will be streamed by the liberal video outlets NowThis, Attn:, and the Young Turks. Sanders said the idea came to him after appearing on CNN-hosted forums on health care and taxes — experiences he'd mostly enjoyed — and hit a wall.
It took three hours and 19 minutes for senior Army officials to approve a request for National Guard troops to be deployed to the Capitol on Jan. 6. Maj. Gen. William Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, said in a Senate hearing it could have made a difference if the Guard had been deployed earlier, Matt Zapotosky, Paul Sonne and Devlin Barrett report. Walker described the Pentagon's restrictions as 'unusual,' noting that he didn't have such limitations last June when the D.C. Guard was tasked with responding to local racial justice protests.

And we'll take our first question from Katherine Skiba with Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau.
Trump did this for two reasons. First, it was clear the pandemic was going to create big problems, and he didn't want to bear responsibility for them. The sentiment was: Let the governors own the lockdowns. We will own the recovery. Second, Republicans have for years denigrated the federal government, arguing that it was incompetent and dysfunctional, that Washington was corrupt and that the private sector could handle everything better. Trump's initial solution to the pandemic was to line up a bunch of private companies and announce that they would quickly set up websites and testing centers to cover the population. Little of that actually happened.
The Bloomberg campaign made a Twitter thread calling out vandalism on different campaign offices, including one in Flint, Mich. It backfired. Consider this from the former secretary of labor:

The suggestions include giving the Social Security Administration, rather than the IRS, responsibility for disbursing the payments. That was the mechanism Romney chose in the child benefit plan he released earlier this month. His plan, unlike Biden's, called for cuts to existing anti-poverty programs to fund the benefit.
While the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the gap between Lamb and Saccone, Democrats ended election night confident that Saccone would not win them by a large enough margin to pull ahead. The National Republican Congressional Committee said it was confident of a Saccone victory after every legal vote is counted.
* GOP GOVERNORS PRESS TRUMP ON REPEAL: CNN reports that governors, including Republicans, are worried about the impact that Obamacare repeal will have on the Medicaid money flowing to their states:
-- The Trump team is asserting an extraordinarily far-reaching view of the presidential prerogative. It fits with a pattern: Trump himself has repeatedly said Article II of the Constitution lets him do whatever he wants. It doesn't, of course.
Several Democratic incumbents, meanwhile, are breathing easier. The Marist-NBC News poll has a bit of good news for Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who has trailed current Gov.

The news conference was ostensibly billed as a chance for Trump to announce his new pick to head the Labor Department — Alexander Acosta, who would be the first Latino in Trump's Cabinet — after Andrew Puzder, his original choice, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid mounting opposition on Capitol Hill. But for one hour and 17 minutes, the president offered the verbal equivalent of the brash and impetuous early morning tweets that have become the alarm clock for much of Washington, taking aim at everything from illegal immigrant violence to the criminal leaks within his intelligence community.

1. Medication-assisted treatment. Medications like methadone and buprenorphine not only reduce withdrawal symptoms but also reduce the risk of relapse and overdose. Medication-assisted therapy saves lives, Lipi writes. Yet of the 23 million Americans with substance use disorders, only 1 in 10 get access to this treatment. This egregious treatment gap is driven by stigma, as well as lack of patient and clinician knowledge, legislative obstacles, and the like.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: We want Trump. We want Trump.
Trump thinks North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un loves him, so Trump gives up leverage that might force North Korea to denuclearize. Trump trusts the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community's, so Trump refuses to secure America's elections and tries to extort Ukraine, a U.S. ally. Trump is obsessed with Barack Obama, so he tries to wreck whatever bears his predecessor's name or is associated with Obama's legacy, despite his own failure to devise a better alternative (e.g., the Iran deal, Obamacare).
Trump's statements about the coronavirus, filled with self-congratulations, inanities, falsehoods and non sequiturs, remind us that he is unable to cope with reality; his sole aim is to elevate himself (although his antics make him look ridiculous). He wants a cruise ship to stay offshore so the number of reported cases in the United States will remain artificially low? That's just nuts, and worse, it is dangerous.

It called for dedicated committee staff members who could examine broad federal needs to address the crisis as well as state and district-specific needs.
In starting with subsidy adjustments, the powerful Ways and Means Committee is essentially saying that, because of the pandemic, the American people are in a world of hurt right now, and they need help right now, said Stan Dorn, a longtime health-policy specialist and senior fellow at Families USA, a liberal consumer health group. Let's take those steps that the vast majority of health-care stakeholders support . . . and at some later point we can revisit these broader philosophical questions, including Biden's campaign plans for a public insurance option and lowering the age at which Americans can join Medicare to 60.
Silverman has spent years justifying her mother's behavior. Even now, she worries that The Bedwetter, rescheduled to open in early 2022, puts too much emphasis on her mother's depression. She knows so much of what made her childhood difficult is also what helped her find her voice onstage.
It could be risky for states to ask for block grants, because that could result in less federal funds. But it would also help states lighten their own spending load. Medicaid currently consumes 16 percent of all state spending, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission.
Sir, I promise you, I will answer your question. I'm laying out first of all the problems, Cruz said. He went on to say that the most pragmatic, the most prudent thing to do is repeal the law and start over. When that is done, he said that competition in the marketplace should be expanded, people should be able to buy health insurance across state lines and that everyone wants people to have insurance coverage.
The FDA listed more than 50 drugs whose manufacturers have withheld or refused to sell samples, and cited 164 inquiries for help obtaining them, KHN's Sydney Lupkin reports. Indeed, a KHN analysis found that 47 of the drugs cost Medicare and Medicaid almost $12 billion in 2016.
I also am no fan of high deductibles, even if the primary care is free. We just saw during this shutdown that most people can't even come up with four hundred dollars.
In sum, a minority of politically focused Americans express violent hostility against either partisan opponents or mavericks in their own party; of the those, the other party is the more common target.
Republicans insist they will replace these things, but it's completely unclear how or with what. And the law of unintended consequences certainly applies here. Democrats are banking on it, in fact.
Barr said he personally would support a federal law that prohibits marijuana everywhere, calling the current patchwork system of state laws untenable and almost like a backdoor nullification of federal law.
What's more, a growing pool of Americans with skimpy health insurance plans is fed by those with employer-sponsored coverage — not people buying plans on their own via the ACA's individual marketplaces, Commonwealth found. That underscores a long-standing trend wherein employers have grappled with rising health-care costs by requiring workers to pay a larger share of their premiums or offering plans with higher deductibles.
KASICH: So now all of a sudden, I'm starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats. I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.
At the White House: Trump will lead a listening session on healthcare before joining Mike Pence and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao for lunch. He will then meet with members of his cabinet and sign an executive order titled Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch. In the evening, Trump will have dinner with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster.
This was a clear sign that President Trump is working in sync with us in the House and Senate and wants to make sure we get this done quickly, said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority whip. We've laid out a lot of specifics, and I think you saw the president embrace and endorse a lot of those key components tonight.
Another significant division is over how to structure tax breaks to encourage individuals to buy insurance plans. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and other House leaders say they favor refundable tax credits, while many conservatives say they prefer less expansive — and expensive — tax deductions.

-- Far-right French presidential candidate Marine LePen, who visited the Kremlin on Friday and whose party has reportedly received financing from Russian banks, said at a rally Sunday that the European Union will disappear if she wins, seeking to fire up her supporters in the final month before the country's election. The European Union will die because the people do not want it anymore ... arrogant and hegemonic empires are destined to perish, Le Pen said to loud cheers and applause. This is exactly what Putin wants, of course. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg Politics composite of French polls show independent candidate Emmanuel Macron holding an edge that is now well within the margin of error -- with 26 percent of the vote compared with 25 percent for Le Pen. Republican Francois Fillon, meanwhile, remains in third place with 17.5 percent. (Reuters)

Biden has run three different times, Lykes said in Columbia. I'm always scared because Donald Trump is a savvy campaigner. You've got to have someone who is on their tippy toes and ready to fight back. I don't think Biden can do that. He has too many gaffes. You can see it in the debates. He's having a hard enough time just against the candidates we have. But Bernie can stand up to Trump like nobody's business.
Reince Priebus froze after the 'Access Hollywood' tape leaked
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM! Trump tweeted on Thursday.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had asked him to deliver a message to furloughed workers — and challenged his assessment, pointing out that the Senate had endorsed plans previously to devote billions to border security on a bipartisan basis, that the president had shot down.
The plan embraces long-standing Republican principles like cutting rates and eliminating deductions while embracing a business consumption tax that is increasingly popular in conservative think-tank circles.
The charges are just one indication of the massive job that awaits Azar at HHS, a sprawling agency at the center of some of the most pressing and controversial issues of the day. It'll be his job to guide the agency through all sorts of new waters, from Medicaid waivers giving states new latitude, to revisions to Medicare payment changes, to Obamacare rule changes – just to name a few.
The former Republican congressman who left the party after endorsing impeachment replied to Graham's new argument against witnesses:
AHH: Yesterday the Senate gave overwhelming approval to a massive bill expanding access for veterans to visit private doctors, sending President Trump a victory that helps cement one of his biggest campaign promises, The Post's Lisa Rein reports. The VA Mission Act, which cleared the Senate by a vote of 92 to 5 and the House by a wide margin last week, is expected to reach the president's desk as soon as Memorial Day.
The Republican was speaking about Obamacare on Monday in Graniteville, near Augusta, when the crowd started chanting: You lie! You lie! You lie!
On Wednesday, the State Department said it was evacuating additional Americans from Guangzhou after initially evacuating the government employee who had reported hearing strange noises in his apartment and was exhibiting symptoms of brain injury, Simon and Carol write. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said investigators were reviewing the case.
In March, 50 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of the ACA, while 39 percent viewed it unfavorably, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That is near the record low of unfavorable views of the health reform law — 37 percent viewed it unfavorably in February.
CRUZ: Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America. And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime. It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer reacted swiftly — but it wasn't to applaud the slower rate increases. Instead, he said the CBO report confirms the Trump-GOP sabotage of our health-care system is causing premiums to rise for millions of Americans — period.
SPICER: I think I answered the question, Alexis, so -- it's been a principle and a commitment of his during the campaign trail and he's going to continue to convey that to members of Congress as we work with Dr. Price and Seema Verma to repeal and replace Obamacare, and replace it with something that's strengthened, more affordable, and provides greater access to both doctors and plans, and instills more competition that ends up with a better healthcare system that all Americans can enjoy.
In the end, she said in an interview, Sanders's greatest contribution may involve demonstrating the importance of what she called inside/outside politics. Sanders and his movement sought to create outside pressure on elected officials, but also encouraged its members to join the electoral fray and win places at the tables of influence. The goal is a change in belief about what is possible and then figuring out how to move things on a tangible level.
In response, the White House armed CVA, Hegseth and other conservative groups with talking points to rebut Shulkin's claims to the media, casting them as lies and providing backup material showing contradictions in his story, according to a document obtained by The Washington Post.
Another poll this month from Saint Anselm College found that 88 percent of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters said they are more likely to support a candidate who advocates for the Green New Deal. That was a higher number than Medicare-for-all, regulating Wall Street, taxing the ultra-wealthy and providing tuition-free college.
A third commercial released by Sanders on Wednesday features audio of Obama praising him in 2016 and footage of the two men walking chummily together along the White House colonnade. Asked about the ad, Sanders acknowledged that he and Obama aren't best friends but added that they talk every now and then. Sanders said he signed off on the commercial to clear up a lot of dishonesty about his relationship with Obama, an apparent reference to news reports that he considered launching a primary challenge against the then-president in 2012.
But this policy pits drugmakers against insurers, who hate the idea of being required to forfeit more of their rebates. They're not at all pleased that CMS is examining such a policy via its request last November for information to gather comments on the idea.
Many conservatives, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), criticized that effort, saying it did not go far enough. The two lawmakers, then candidates for the GOP presidential nomination, eventually voted for the chance to gut the health-care law, but some conservatives are still frustrated that a repeal bill can only go so far because of the budget rule constraints.
The Senate effort is expected to play out as a kind of tug-of-war between moderate and conservative senators, who will have to compromise on some issues for the bill to win enough support to pass. Both factions are represented in the working group, along with Republican committee chairmen and members of GOP leadership.

They're pointing to the dissent as a sign the newest justice would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and side with conservatives in future abortion-rights related cases, our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Michael Scherer report.
Also left intact by the 2015 bill: HHS regulations that created national insurance standards defining the benefits that must be included in ACA health plans, as well as limits on how much insurance companies can vary their pricing of those plans by age, gender or other factors.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist and recently delivered a speech defending the term, responded by citing polls showing him defeating Trump.
The Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it, Whitehouse wrote. Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'  (That quote referred to a poll suggesting Americans liked the idea of restructuring the court.)
Why Kirstjen Nielsen's loyalty to Trump wasn't enough to save her job:
A CNN anchor talked to a Trump voter about the tariffs:
Congressional aides declined to give specific details of any planned changes until lawmakers meet and the committees begin their work. But key lawmakers and aides said the new repeal bill may not differ much from the eight-page 2015 bill.
And the administration could find it even harder to defend these block grants. Christen Linke Young, a health fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me that changes to payment structures aren't among the things the federal government can let states experiment with, under the Social Security Act. Beyond that, the administration may also need to justify to courts why a block grant would further the objectives of the Medicaid program.
In July 2005, a Democratic staff memo says that Barr participated in a panel discussion in which he said: There is nothing wrong with coercive interrogation, applying pain, discomfort and other things that make people talk, so long as it doesn't cross the line and involve the gratuitous barbarity involved in torture. Barr has also said in the past that he supported President George W. Bush's decision to use military tribunals rather than civilian courts to try al-Qaeda members. Democratic committee staffers said they expect him to be asked about this topic.

Sanders and his campaign have stepped up criticism of MSNBC.
Second, the HHS report did not account for the fact that older and less healthy people were now able to afford insurance because of tax subsidies. Indeed, the report fails to mention that about 80 percent of people in the marketplace are not affected by premium increases because their costs are mostly covered by the government.
Over the past decade, Silverman's penchant for shocking, potty-mouthed material has evolved to embrace more of what she calls social politics. She's still not above discussing, in detail, her Internet porn search words. But she also addressed the Democratic National Convention. Her philosophy, onstage and off, is that not everybody is stupid, not only her views are right, and if we listen to those we disagree with instead of rolling our eyes, we might get somewhere. Imagine being as clever as John Oliver without the snark.
General Kelly's former military advisers, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Robert Gates -- Senate consideration of Senator Sessions and -- as attorney general and John Kelly to be Homeland Security secretary are examples of the progress towards the president-elect's banner issue during his campaign; securing the southern border.
In 2013, Cruz seized the Senate floor for 21 hours to launch a full-scale attack against President Obama's health-care reform law, Obamacare. He promised to speak against the law until I am no longer able to stand. When he finally did sit, the government shut down for two weeks, polls showed Americans blamed Republicans for it, and Obamacare stayed funded. At the time, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) called it the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Many Republicans went along with the gambit, but largely because Cruz forced them to toe the line for fear of upsetting the GOP base.
Clearly we want emergency provisions here, Rector said. But it shouldn't be a Trojan horse for permanently transforming the welfare state.
The unilateral actions considered by Sanders's campaign are likely to be fiercely opposed by conservatives and even moderate liberals, they write. Sanders could face criticism for moving to take more power away from the legislative branch amid ever-expanding executive authority, although he has been a vocal proponent of giving Congress more power over the country's wars and military interventions. Many Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Trump for the numerous executive orders he signed in the early part of his presidency.
Ron Klain, the White House Ebola response coordinator under the Obama administration, told Congress on Feb. 5 that it was a misnomer to describe the administration's action as a travel ban. We don't have a travel ban, Klain said. We have a travel Band-Aid right now. First, before it was imposed, 300,000 people came here from China in the previous month. So, the horse is out of the barn.
The decree, issued by Madison County Probate Judge Frank Barger, explicitly states 'Baby Roe' is a person and allows plaintiff Ryan Magers to name the fetus as a co-plaintiff in the suit for 'wrongful death,' our colleagues write. Magers said in court filings that when his then-girlfriend discovered she was pregnant in early 2017, he 'repeatedly pleaded' with her to carry the pregnancy to term and give birth, but she wanted to have an abortion.

At the same time, Trump rejects Ryan's entire style of politics, which uses detailed budget projections to sketch out worries for the future, followed by an appeal for shared sacrifice.
President Trump's health-care actions could have ripple effects throughout the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
Passage of Obamacare has most benefited Americans who lacked coverage before its enactment — about 50 million at the time — and people with workplace-sponsored coverage, whose plans must cover benefits more generously. Insurers in the individual and group markets cover preventive services without charging co-pays and are prohibited from placing annual or lifetime caps on coverage.

Following up on Julie's question, can you elaborate on the president-elect's determination not to impact Medicare, which has been a vow or a commitment he's made publicly since 2015, in the context of the Affordable Care Act?
At about 2:30 Thursday morning, House GOP leaders moved to consider their Zika package, which was part of a larger veterans and military construction spending bill, before adjourning the chamber until July 5. It passed on a 239 to 171 vote.
It will be further undermined when a president who has done all of these things is acquitted and vindicated by a deeply partisan and feckless Senate majority.
-- Lawyers and academics strongly disagreed with Dershowitz, Rachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Ann Marimow report. Frank O. Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor and author of the book 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors,' said Dershowitz's view is out of step with mainstream constitutional scholars and historians. 'In making this argument, Alan is essentially alone, and I mean alone,' Bowman said Tuesday, accusing Republicans of seizing on Dershowitz's argument because it gives them cover not to convict a president in their own party. 'What Dershowitz did yesterday was stand up and be a guy with Harvard attached to his name and spout complete nonsense that's totally unsupported by any scholarship, anywhere.'

Underscoring this point, the sentiment that the country is heading in the wrong direction gets about 57 percent in the RealClearPolitics average while roughly 34 say we are on the right track. Polling for wrong track may stay high in an extremely polarized country since opponents of an incumbent president want to go in the other direction while a segment of the incumbent's base usually think he's deviated from their ideal. In other words, Americans are rarely satisfied with the status quo — which is why everything is perfectly fine campaigns don't do very well.
If you have nothing nice to say, just don't say it at all, really, Lunadetta said. Especially don't take it to social media.

Mathur was part of a joint working group with scholars from the Brookings Institution that released recommendations last September for paid family leave. They endorsed eight weeks of paid parental leave at 70 percent of wages with a maximum benefit of $600 per week, paid for with a modest payroll tax increase.
The court's past half-century of favoring the rich and powerful coincides almost exactly with the period when the richest Americans have left the rest of the nation behind. The World Inequality Report 2018, produced by Thomas Piketty and other economists — the most recent available — identified two chief drivers of economic inequality in the United States: unequal educational opportunity and an increasingly regressive tax system. The modern court has contributed greatly to both.
Romney is asked about Trump's comments.
-- Krauthammer was a devoted baseball fan who loved to chat about the Nationals. So it was fitting that there was a moment of silence at the start of last night's game:
-- Opposition leader Juan Guaidó will meet with regional leaders and Vice President Pence in Colombia today as he pushes for foreign allies to increase pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. Anthony Faiola reports: Guaidó suggested that he would entertain more radical solutions to try to oust Maduro, a reference taken by observers to mean that he may broach the subject of additional moves by the United States, which has already imposed deep sanctions on Venezuela. … Guaidó's comments suggested the opposition's limitations after a plan they had hoped would cause deep fissures in Maduro's military structure instead produced only modest cracks. In the face of Maduro's military blockade of aid, they largely failed to bring in the assistance they had hoped to deliver to the neediest Venezuelans.
As Trump prepares for his first State of the Union address, the state of Clinton country can be summarized in one word: Hostile.
Graham, known for his one-liners, peppered his opening warm-up with several of them, as he outlined his priorities for the next two years, which include a focus on trying to tame the wild West of social media and ethics revision.
I made a commitment to continue getting my own health care at the VA when I was elected to Congress. That's single-payer, and I'll tell you — it's not perfect, he said. So if I'm elected, I'm not going to force you off your private health care plan. I want Medicare, or a more modern version of Medicare, to be available to everybody but I'm not going to force you off your private health-care plan if you like it.
I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
Clinton has jumped around in her career goals. She worked at McKinsey & Co. and later Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund management firm. Then the woman who refused to talk to the media landed a job as a special correspondent for NBC News. Now she works at the Clinton Global Initiative.

Trump's team tried to be subtle in promoting it. Some of the campaign's supporters, though, were more explicit. One declared that they — presumably the party — stole Iowa from Bernie Sanders in 2016 and they're going to try and do it again in 2020. Conservative pundit Erick Erickson was explicit about the utility of the mistakes the Iowa Democratic Party had displayed.
On the other contentious health-care issue that has dominated his attention, the Affordable Care Act, Trump devoted a single sentence. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty, he said, referring to Congress's elimination of the federal fine for people who flout the ACA's requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. That change took effect last month.
Guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the conditions of unemployment insurance employers are required to carry. (The vast majority of workers still don't have such paid leave.)
And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.
That has left backers of Ryan-style change trying to put the best face on a bad situation. Maybe, some say, President Trump could be persuaded to cut a deal — in spite of his campaign promises.
Francis also gave Trump a signed copy of his 2017 peace message whose title is Nonviolence — A Style of Politics for Peace, and a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter on the need to protect the environment from the effects of climate change. Well, I'll be reading them, Trump said.

Reduce the number of people receiving welfare.

Since then, though, the number of Americans receiving government help has vastly expanded.)
I've joked, anyone whose premiums have dropped $2500 as President Obama promised should vote for Hillary Clinton. I'll take everybody else, as some people chuckled. Valde wasn't amused.
Other priorities Azar will oversee include trying to control rampant opioid addiction that is ravaging many U.S. communities, Amy continues. He will be under pressure to find ways to constrain drug prices — a realm in which suspicions of him run high given his years as a top executive of Eli Lilly. In addition, he will be at the vortex of the ongoing political feud over the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law that has spread insurance to millions of Americans and is a main target of the administration and congressional Republicans.
Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term this year, is sounding the alarm and trying to galvanize conservatives. In a tweetstorm overnight, he repeatedly warned of a potential blue wave and asked volunteers and donors to step up:

For instance, the rise in uninsured rates since 2016 — a direct result of the GOP's Obamacare sabotage — takes on new salience. Stories of Americans stuck with big bills for coronavirus testing and hospital stays are likely to discourage people who are uninsured or underinsured from getting screened and treated.
The Democratic National Committee is also running this ad in battleground states:
The Associated Press is already reporting that it's likely many will lose coverage. As for the cost, we will have to wait a week or more for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said he sent letters to 12 major pharmaceutical companies, seeking information and documents about medications and how they're priced. He asked seven drug companies -- AstraZeneca, Teva, Celgene, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, and Mallinckrodt -- for information about just one of their drugs. He asked three others -- Amgen, Pfizer, and Novo Nordisk -- for information about two drugs each and he asked Sanofi and AbbVie to provide information about three drugs each.
Thank you, Mr. Trump. I totally support you. You have my vote.
HHS regularly invites only media it perceives as friendly to phone calls with agency officials; two recent examples were when the agency announced a new religious freedom division and when it issued guidance laying out how states could impose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients.
But it may prove trickier to get moderates on board. Senate leaders are hoping the big draw for them lies in the bill's more generous income-based approach to insurance subsidies, which closely mirror the subsidies offered under Obamacare.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) assured supporters that she can both do her day job and run for president:
More than a dozen senior administration officials have completed more than 100 national television, radio, and podcast interviews, an administration official said, and aides have also done over 30 local television interviews. »
-- Liberals mock Trump as ineffective at their own peril. Yes, it's easy to joke about how Trump said during the campaign that he'd win so much people would get tired of winning. Both of his travel bans have been blocked — for now. An active FBI investigation into his associates is a big gray cloud over the White House. The president himself falsely accused his predecessor of wiretapping him. His first national security adviser registered as a foreign agent after being fired for not being honest about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. His attorney general, at best, misled Congress under oath.
Among them was the administration's expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. The policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the White House, but Trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. Past GOP presidents had limited it to the money the United States gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.
Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened — it's up in the prison area — my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.
The investigation was initially sparked by various complaints alleging VA's Executive Protection Division was being mismanaged, our Post colleagues Katie Mettler and Lisa Rein report, adding the alleged failures detail missteps that went on for years and came to a head under Shulkin.
Ranking committee Democrat Adam Schiff implied that he suspects a White House hand in what he called Nunes's dead-of-night excursion to view classified documents. But to review classified files lawfully, Nunes would likely have needed to do so at a secure facility – and congressional officials said that the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the NSA have all indicated they got no late-night visit from Nunes. Nunes has repeatedly refused to say where he went or whether the documents were provided by the White House, including when confronted by committee members during a closed-door meeting. And Sean Spicer has also refused to rule out a White House role: I don't know where he got the documents from, so I can't say anything more than 'I don't know,' he said during Friday's press briefing.
Or if you need help affording housing? The administration is planning to cut $6 billion from the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. How about if your local police department is mistreating you and your fellow citizens? Sorry, you're on your own: In his first speech as attorney general, Jeff Sessions made clear that the Justice Department will step back from monitoring police departments for abuse. And don't think that workplace protections are going to be vigorously enforced, not under this administration and with this Congress. In fact, Republicans just introduced a bill to allow companies to force their employees to undergo genetic testing. Because why not? While the Trump White House may be in chaos, powerful industries looking for action on their wish lists have been invited right in and granted quick satisfaction.
The backlash that 19 House Republicans braced for after their surprise flip on Medicaid has been milder than many had expected. That's a stunner given that Republicans in Virginia and around the country have used resistance to Obamacare to drive voters to the polls for nearly a decade, including elections just last fall.
The hang-ups: It seems that for every Republican who wants dreamers protected, there is another Republican, such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who sees it as amnesty.
York meant that as an expression of awe, but it's more accurate to read the phrasing as written. There was no real competition, but Trump poured resources in anyway — adding something of an asterisk to the overwhelming support he enjoyed.
-- Retired Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher – who was accused of war crimes but championed by Trump – struck back at the active-duty SEALs who testified against him by highlighting their faces in a video published on social media. From the San Diego Union-Tribune: In a three-minute video posted to his Facebook page and Instagram account … Gallagher, 40, referred to some members of his former platoon as 'cowards' and highlighted names, photos and — for those still on active duty — their duty status and current units, something former SEALs say places those men — and the Navy's mission — in jeopardy. … [A] former SEAL from the platoon said publicizing the faces of active-duty SEALs — including one assigned to the elite Development Group, or SEAL Team 6 — could put the lives of the men and their families in danger. … The video appears to be a trailer for an unspecified future project. Tim Parlatore, one of Gallagher's attorneys, declined to say Monday what that project is or when it will be published.
I know what young people's lives are like because I've run universities. I know how long they are outside of the regular market. So I think if you did that and let people buy into Medicare or Medicaid — because Medicaid is far more comprehensive than Medicare is. I've talked to a lot of people that support Medicare-for-all. I said I wanted to do Medicaid for all. That's a better program. It's got long- term care. And they said, 'Well, we can fix Medicare' . . . very expensive to fix.

Correction: An earlier version said Trump introduced his drug prices blueprint on May 30. It was first unveiled on May 11. An earlier version said Azar had run Eli Lilly. He ran affiliate Lilly USA.
Trump's abrupt Friday-night firing of Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, indicated that the purge of central players in the impeachment process had not been tempered by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Atkinson had alerted Congress about a whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's impeachment over his actions toward Ukraine.
Chyrons also help grab the eyeballs of the many people who watch TV while glancing at a second screen, such as a smartphone, said Marc Greenstein, vice president of design and production for NBC News and MSNBC.
On the other side of the Capitol, the Republican-controlled Senate seemed to stand more firmly than ever against expansion. That forced the upper chamber to cut $420 million from the budget proposed last year by then-governor Terry McAuliffe (D), who included expansion in his plan.

Tensions between the United States and Iran have ratcheted up in recent days, as Iran downed an American drone and Trump imposed sanctions in retaliation, after initially considering a military strike.
It's also true ACA marketplace problems existed before the GOP took power. Premium increases were so large in 2016 that many Democrats were forced to admit that some changes to the ACA were needed.
-- A federal appeals court appeared skeptical of arguments that profits from Trump's D.C. hotel violate the Constitution's emoluments clause. Ann E. Marimow and Jonathan O'Connell report: The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit was reviewing a novel case brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia … One judge, Dennis W. Shedd, suggested the president may actually be driving up business at other local hotels because of people who would be drawn to Washington to protest Trump's policies and would not choose to stay at the president's namesake hotel. Another, Paul V. Niemeyer, noted that the president had already stepped back from day-to-day management of Trump International Hotel.

But when Republicans won unified control of the government in 2016, they were unable to come up with a replacement or muster the votes to repeal the health law. Instead, as more Americans became alarmed at the notion of losing the ACA, its popularity increased.
If you take the Democrats' argument to its logical conclusion, you could be dead and you could still be impeached, Castor said. You could impeach Abraham Lincoln or George Washington or Bill Clinton, anyone. The Senate could be doing this from now until the end of time.

The alternative is right there in front of him. The Culinary Workers plan is indeed a good one, similar in broad outline to Western European plans. Beneficiaries pay no premium but give up some wages (equivalent to extra taxes in single-payer or other universal plans). In return, they get medical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage — with costs controlled through co-pays and other rules.

-- Federal prosecutors said that Trump confidant Roger Stone deserves seven to nine years in prison for lying to Congress in the Russia probe. Spencer Hsu, Ann Marimow and Devlin Barrett report: The sentencing filing came after days of tense debate within the U.S. attorney's office in Washington about the proper prison term for the sixth Trump associate convicted and last person indicted in former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. Front-line prosecutors, some previously with Mueller's team, argued for a sentence on the higher end for Stone than some of their supervisors were comfortable with, according to two people familiar with the discussions. A recommendation on the higher end prevailed, with prosecutors' filings citing federal sentencing guidelines that ratchet up in cases involving obstruction that impedes the administration of justice. ...
For Democrats, the chief objective is ensuring that their questions create an opportunity for House managers to respond to the Trump team's arguments. … But many Democrats also want to use their time to challenge Trump's team on what they believe are a series of misrepresentations — including how much his lawyers knew about Bolton's assertions that Trump held up Ukraine aid to secure an investigation of the Biden family, when they were claiming there was no quid pro quo. … Senators may direct questions at representatives on either side, but they cannot select which manager from the prosecution or lawyer from the defense answers them … But part of the allure of turning the spotlight on lawyers is that neither side has at their disposal the testimony of fact witnesses they believe are central to the case.

More than 200,000 Americans have signed up for Obamacare plans during a special enrollment period.
There are more potential roadblocks ahead. Already, congressional Republicans have balked at his proposed budget, and the White House's insistence on increased spending for the military and a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could imperil a spending bill needed to keep the government running past the end of April.
Forced to make the choice, Biden said he would not resume expelling minors. Since then, the number of minors in federal custody has more than tripled to 7,000, prompting officials to reopen an overflow shelter in Texas to house them — even though the shelter is not state-licensed, as required — until officials can place them with a parent or guardian in the United States.
Under the Affordable Care Act, states can raise those income limits, and the federal government will pick up 90 percent of the cost. The income ceiling would rise to $16,750 a year for a disabled person or able-bodied adult, and $28,700 for a family of three.

In the United States, by contrast, our approach has been to deny the problem, demonize those with whom we disagree and ostracize anyone who dares to compromise. As a result, we now have millions of blue-collar workers who are idle or underemployed, millions of unskilled immigrants who are here illegally, and too few of the skilled immigrants we need. Our physical environment, meanwhile, is subject to an unending series of devastating floods, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather events. The cost, in terms of lost output and economic damage, runs to tens of billions of dollars every year.

— In Indian Country, the shutdown has meant critical funding hasn't arrived to keep health clinics running. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory, the New York Times's Mitch Smith and Julie Turkewitz write. But that means a government shutdown can largely sideline a tribe's basic functions.

The rate filings are a starting point for negotiations, but Burrell noted that the numbers could rise. He said his company had made its filings assuming that the cost-sharing reductions, billions of dollars in federal payments that lower out-of-pocket expenses for about 7 million Americans, would be made. Politicians have not committed to making those payments in 2018, and if those go away, premiums could rise another 10 to 15 percent, Burrell said.

We've got to figure out a way to get everybody covered and we've got to use, in my judgment, existing vehicles to do that. We have these platforms: Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Plan — that's number one.
Many Americans may not have given much thought to what a breathtaking departure this represents, because until now we have had the luxury of never having to think about such things. We have been able to take for granted the quadrennial peaceful transition of power. We watch from a distance when political parties in one foreign country or another take up arms after losing an election. We look, as at something that could never happen here, when a foreign leader sends an opponent to jail or into exile. This can happen in Zimbabwe, we think, or Russia, or Cambodia, but not here. Not in the United States.
The federal appeals court judges voted 8 to 6 to reject a request to rehear the case.
Trade is a big deal in Iowa and we export a lot of our agriculture commodities to other countries, Ernst said, explaining the value of pork has plummeted. We export a lot of pork into other countries but the tariffs are a big issue right now. So China used to buy a lot of pork and the stuff that Americans don't eat.
We're actually going down to see if we can get the Republican health-care bill. Do you know anything about that? Booker asked the cab driver at the start of his livestream.
In the Trump administration, there were apparently no contentious meetings or hand-wringing over the impact on Capitol Hill. He just did it. This fearlessness when it comes to the cause of life is what warms the hearts of Christian conservatives and makes them loyal to the president.
After that happened, a Mason-Dixon poll of Tennessee voters found 49 percent of Democrats approved of him vs. just 36 percent of Republicans. Corker eventually voted for the final package, but he opted not to seek reelection.
Democratic 2020 contenders are split over whether Congress should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president:
Our interest in this proposal is trying to figure out a way to help patients afford their medicines at the pharmacy counter, Lisa Joldersma, PhRMA's senior vice president for policy and research, told reporters.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) unveiled a plan to provide families with at least $3,000 a year for each child.
This ought to be a moment when the GOP is back in its comfort zone. It's not a party built for governing; Republicans no longer have much of a policy agenda, their leaders have become much more skilled at obstruction than at passing laws, and they have an enormous propaganda machine with a talent for creating fear and outrage. The party's specialty is opposition.
At one point, he even tried to get Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, off the D.C. Court of Appeals by recommending he lead the FBI. That would have given McConnell a chance to essentially replace Garland twice on two different powerful courts.
The Internet Archive has a project in which it catalogues the closed captioning from news programs each day, including Fox and Friends. They were kind enough to share with The Post the captioning for every day of Trump's presidency through Thursday. We went through it and isolated each time a speaker mentioned Trump, Hillary Clinton, the Democrats (as a group) or the Republicans and picked out what was being said about each.
Rather, as the first major test of the efficacy of resistance to Trumpism, this episode constitutes an important moment because it shows that broad, determined opposition may be able to prevent Trump from escalating this policy — and other, related immigration and terrorism policies — into something a whole lot worse.
Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Beto O'Rourke, Elizabeth Warren and six other candidates took the stage to introduce themselves to votes in Miami. (The Washington Post)
In a strange way, this really merged our teams — our team in the House with the president's team — even more closely, he said at another point in the call. I think the White House, the president in particular, has a much, much clearer understanding of just the dynamic that we have in the House Republican Conference. And so that, if anything, is very helpful that he really now appreciates the challenges we have of governing and of becoming a governing party.
TRUMP: Well, OK, I never said that.
Grassley's office confirmed Pfizer, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck have agreed to send representatives to appear before the panel at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 26. The two companies that have yet to respond to the summons are AbbVie and AstraZeneca.
But other analysts say that's optimistic and predict growth will be closer to 2.2 percent, as the New York Times reported. After its most recent meeting, on June 13, the Federal Open Market Committee said it expected 2.8 percent GDP growth in 2018, 2.4 percent in 2019, 2 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in the longer run. The FOMC is the Federal Reserve's policymaking arm.
The individual market serves about 18 million people. So where did Harris get the 129 million figure?
The memo, there will be a lot of talk about it, Graham said as he opened Barr's confirmation hearing Tuesday. As there should be.
In an interview, Wehrum [said] he has followed the letter of the law … [He] acknowledges that he has met with two former clients at his old firm — without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. He also weighed in on a policy shift that could have influenced litigation involving DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility represented by his former firm.
The Agriculture Department and many state and local governments have made it easier for residents to get food assistance during the coronavirus crisis. The federal government boosted the amount of money for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program used to be known as food stamps.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is a pretty good guy, it seems, to have for a friend.
This time around, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) will hold enormous sway over whatever can be passed, as the most moderate Democratic senator. He has said he favors improving on Obamacare. But the door is probably closed to passing anything more ambitious, such as a government-backed public option plan. And it's definitely closed to anything resembling Medicare-for-all.
— The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report this morning warning that Medicaid work requirements will have an inadvertent consequence of people being dropped from coverage who are in fact working or who should otherwise be exempt from the requirement.
[FDA Commissioner Scott] Gottlieb's actions on generic approvals have drawn praise from both parties in Congress, Anna reports. But with Democrats having taken control of the House, members who oversee the FDA say they plan to examine a crucial public-health question posed by his efforts: Is the fast-tracking of those approvals coming at the expense of oversight that's supposed to ensure that drugs already on the market are safe and effective?
Complicating matters, leaders must also jump through a series of other procedural hoops, like waiting for an official cost estimate before the health-care bill can come up for a vote. That process typically takes around two weeks, meaning leaders would need to have a final bill in hand soon to get it scored and hold a vote by the end of next month.
The level of dishonesty is out of control, Trump said.
This is our future — our fate — and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.
In 2017, there were nearly 40,000 new HIV diagnoses in the United States, according to the CDC. An estimated 1.1 million people had the virus that causes AIDS, with about 15 percent of them undiagnosed.
That's one reason expansion supporters have been hoping to flip multiple Senate Republicans. One of them — Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (Augusta) — has supported certain forms of expansion for years, though he opposes the hospital tax that the governor and House want to use to fund the state's 10 percent share of the program.
The Buccaneers won the Super Bowl; the Internet won with its memes:
Following a meeting last week between president-elect and the CEOs of Monsanto and Bayer, the CEO of Bayer, which is the company buying Monsanto, committed to $8 billion in new U.S. research and development and investment. And more -- and more important, committed to retain 100 percent of Monsanto's 9,000-plus U.S. workforce and to create at least 3,000 new U.S. high-tech jobs which span from (inaudible) to robotics, to satellite imagery specialist, engineers, data scientists, advanced readers and statisticians.
Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible). And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.
She said the protesters' concerns about people with preexisting conditions losing coverage are unfounded because, surely, Trump would never allow such a terrible thing to happen to people who need help. That's definitely one of the things he's going to make sure they fix, she said, referring to the Senate bill. I'm sure Trump has scratched his head on that one a lot.
But Alexander insists the measure is still on the table. An aide pointed to comments he made before the holiday break, when he told reporters he had every reason to believe the Alexander-Murray stabilization bill — as well as a reinsurance bill championed by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) — would be in the omnibus package.
There are little nips around the edges, but basically the market seems to be doing okay, said Alice Rivlin, the former head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and a health policy expert with Brookings Institution.
Spicer tried to ignore the woman as she followed him around the store, continuing to ask him if he 'feels good' about working for a 'fascist' and about 'lying to the American people.' 'Such a great country that allows you to be here,' Spicer responded. The woman who supposedly recorded the video tweeted the confrontation.
We welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald. And if you don't want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.
It feels like we are still hostages, Morgan told our colleagues. I'm just so happy to be going back to work and to be able to get on with our lives because I need our health insurance to fill these prescriptions. But who knows if this will all happen again in three weeks.
Should the FTC and DOJ allow a merger, Welch and Rooney wrote, it should be conditioned on a hold harmless provision assuring that it will not be paid for by consumers, taxpayers, or employers, but by shareholders: the ones who stand to benefit.
Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), suddenly looking lonely in a party that he has spent decades taunting, groused that this was just the establishment party rallying to the establishment candidate. That should come as news to Buttigieg and O'Rourke, who ran and present themselves as anything but defenders of the status quo. As he rails against corporate Democrats — following a devastating defeat in South Carolina, where the African American, churchgoing electorate would be stunned to find out that they are robber barons — Sanders increasingly looks small, petty and resentful.
At the front of the room, Chao took her seat, introduced her proud father to the panel and withstood a corny joke from her husband, who happens to be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who promised the committee that his wife had great judgment.
Gardner said he spoke with Trump earlier in the day and was confident the president would sign the bill if Congress passed it. I have talked to the president about this bill, Gardner said at a news conference. In previous conversations he talked about the need to solve this conflict. He talked about his support for a states' rights approach during the campaign. Not putting words in the mouth of the White House, but I think this will be an opportunity for us to fulfill what is that federalism approach.
Seven more bills to undo Obama regulations have passed both chambers of Congress and will soon be signed by the president. Among them: Rolling back worker safety regulations to track and reduce workplace injuries and deaths, reducing disclosure requirements for federal contractors and abolishing a rule that restricted certain kinds of hunting, such as trapping and aerial shooting, inside national wildlife refuges in Alaska.
And so Susan Collins had already committed. Lisa Murkowski had already committed.
A 29 percent spending hike in Obamacare subsidies is buried in the stimulus plan.
Many critiques of Trump's handling of the outbreak have focused on competence. As Democrats turn to health care, they are zeroing in on issues such as the Trump administration's decision to allow the sale of cheaper insurance policies that provide less coverage, saying it gave Americans more choice.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is scheduled to speak at an event hosted by The Hill on patient access to innovation on March 6.
It's difficult to see how that thorny relationship suddenly changes to a productive and positive one, like he promised Monday in a town hall meeting with ABC's Good Morning America once he gets a different job.
Others have argued this: Once hospitals are able to view one another's rates, they'll be able to collectively raise prices for everyone. Transparency will make health-care more expensive, not less is what they contend.
My long-standing concerns about the cost of expansion aren't going away, but unfortunately the ACA is here to stay and the Trump administration is the best chance to secure conservative reforms, Cox said. The governor agreed to an Indiana-style model with a strong work requirement instead of straightforward Medicaid expansion.
If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.
The industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S. Hopkins has reported, although he noted many of the hikes were relatively modest amid pressure on the issue.
Ferriter runs a consulting company, the Ferriter Group, and Hawkins is president and chief executive of the Hawkins Group, which provides federal and commercial advisory and consulting services for cybersecurity and information technology.
But on one key bill, Shulkin ended up siding with more moderate lawmakers in the Senate, who did not want to outsource as much VA care to the private sector as the White House was seeking.
Now these states are arguing that the law is no longer constitutional without the penalty, which Congress repealed as part of its tax overhaul. They say that as a result, consumer insurance protections under the law won't be valid either. Yesterday's three-page letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions begins by saying DOJ adopted its position with the approval of the President of the United States. The letter acknowledges that the decision not to defend an existing law deviates from history but contends that it is not unprecedented.
Other tributes poured in from both parties:
Here's another example, from last year:
Some of the targeted measures already in the bill have prompted a backlash, and leaders are navigating between moderate Republicans who want to preserve key aspects of the ACA and conservatives hoping to pare it back even further.
At Harris's questioning, Barr acknowledged most drugs come through ports of entries — not at points along the border, which a wall might block. He also acknowledged he had not visited such a port since he was attorney general decades ago.
But of course the pandemic crisis is not just about vaccines or even containing the coronavirus, but a broader economic crisis spawned by mass unemployment and shuttered businesses. A group of 10 Republican senators acknowledged that when they countered Biden's plan with their own $600 billion proposal, which included $1,000 checks for Americans. So one could reasonably object that this knock against the bill ignores the rest of the problem.
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
Una última razón para tener esperanza: las acciones hablan más que las palabras. Hace cuatro años, Trump se trasladó del Capitolio a la Casa Blanca para firmar una orden ejecutiva que restringía Obamacare y, una semana después, firmó su prohibición para recibir refugiados sirios y viajeros de ciertos países de mayoría musulmana. Biden planeó pasar su primer día deshaciendo esas y otras órdenes, mientras dirigía a su administración a extender la protección financiera ante la crisis pandémica a inquilinos y estudiantes con préstamos.
Negotiate the release of all U.S. prisoners held in Iran before taking office. (Five Americans were released during the campaign, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian; Trump claimed some credit for this.) (Other U.S. prisoners remain in Iran.)
Lt. Aaron Bahamonde, a spokesman for the Newtown Police Department, told The Post the death of 49-year-old Jeremy Richman puts Newtown back into the spotlight again, as our colleague Lindsey Bever writes. We certainly recognize the heartbreak that this is causing, Bahamonde added. It's a difficult situation that we're all dealing with here and it's a sad situation.
But despite loud calls from progressives to end the procedural maneuver they see as preventing major political change, a Power Up review of Democratic senators revealed ending it only has the clear support of roughly 20 percent of the caucus.
TRUMP: ... We'll find out when we have the (INAUDIBLE)...
So I have two questions, please. What's the president-elect's view of the no-shows and how does their absence impact his desire to be president for all Americans? Thank you.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director, said it appears that Cruz's amendment would send all of the young, healthy people who are cheaper to cover into one insurance pool — and leave sicker, older people in a glorified high-risk pool.
-- Billionaire activist Tom Steyer is trying to press House Democrats toward impeaching Trump by delivering the message to lawmakers' home districts. Politico's Laura Barrón-López and Stephanie Murray report: Steyer's first targets are three powerful committee chairmen, Richard Neal (D-Mass.), [Nadler] and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). But the liberal megadonor isn't stopping there: He will soon turn his attention to rank-and-file members seated on the committees that would be involved in impeachment proceedings, including freshmen.
And at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce. (Not even close. Trump got 12 percent, according to exit polls — although that was an improvement on recent Republican candidates.)
From the bench, Gorsuch has dependably advanced the cause. The most distinctive part of his jurisprudence, which helped ensure his spot on every conservative group's shortlist, is his opposition to what's called Chevron deference. In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that judges should generally defer to administrative agencies' interpretations of federal law in cases where the law may be ambiguous and the agency's position seems reasonable. Even Antonin Scalia bought into this standard. But Gorsuch denounces it as a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.
Checking out a number of panels, I was impressed that, true to its claim, the Federalist Society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. People always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong I am, W. Neil Eggleston, former White House counsel for Obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. He cautioned the newly empowered majority on the Supreme Court against overturning landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.
I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion! Biden said, referring to the Kentucky senator, then the minority leader. But, Biden allowed, sometimes dealmaking wasn't enough: Sometimes you can't do that. Sometimes you have to just go out and beat them.
The focus of the inquiry is unclear, though, as it's part of a civil investigation and not a criminal one: The request to Deutsche Bank sought loan applications, mortgages, lines of credit and other financing transactions in connection with the Trump International Hotel in Washington; the Trump National Doral outside Miami; and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, a source told the Times.
At the same time, McConnell is seeking a separate way of winning wary GOP moderates over whom Trump holds little political influence, such as Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska.), who oppose the bill's blockage of federal funding to Planned Parenthood, among other things.
Friday. The 46th annual March for Life rally will be held in Washington on
In a statement, the Drug Policy Alliance's Lindsay LaSalle compared the issue to states legalizing cannabis in favor of the promotion of public health, despite federal drug laws. The federal government initially attempted to interfere with state and local syringe exchange and medical cannabis programs, but hindsight has proved they were on the wrong side of science and history, she said.
The issue is particularly exasperating to James Rizzo, who ran for a committee seat in 2018 because the member for his voting precinct in Pittsburgh's Spring Hill neighborhood was posting pro-Trump content on Facebook. I did not want to be represented, at the most local level, by a Trump supporter, he said.
I don't think that paying hospitals for uncompensated care results with a healthier population, he said, adding that expansion has provided resources for those struggling with addiction and mental illness. Where are they supposed to go?
The chattering class was still chewing Warren's wealth tax when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) announced her presidential ambitions by relaunching a proposal for a $3,000 per person refundable tax credit for working households at or below the median income.
The rules' defenders argue that association plans would not be allowed to discriminate against people based on their health status, so it would be hard for them to draw only healthy customers. But experts worry the rules may allow plans to discriminate heavily based on age and sex. Plans could also find subtle ways of weeding out sick customers, for example by designing benefits packages that do not cover expensive treatments that some customers need.
When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.
The Fix's Callum Borchers lists three takeaways from the book Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff about President Trump's campaign and first year in office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)
I said, They send it back?
The bill — whose text is included in the draft Senate relief package but not in the House version — lets Medicare pay ambulance providers even if the patients aren't transported to a health-care facility. The authority would last as long as the nation is under a public health emergency.
Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.
The New Hampshire Democratic debate will be held Friday.
-- Trump's executive order ending family separations sparked confusion at the border as officials struggled to understand the it. Nick Miroff, Dan Lamothe and Seung Min Kim report: After a senior Customs and Border Protection official told The Washington Post that the agency would freeze criminal referrals for migrant parents who cross illegally with children, Justice Department officials insisted that their 'zero tolerance' policy remained in force and that U.S. attorneys would continue to prosecute those entering the United States unlawfully. … And despite the ongoing outcry over the separation of more than 2,300 migrant children from their parents since May 5, Trump administration officials gave no assurances that the families would be swiftly reunited. …
-- Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is seeking to distinguish himself from Joe Biden as the two pursue many of the same supporters for their likely 2020 bids. Politico's Daniel Strauss and Holly Otterbein report: Brown, kicking off a pre-campaign tour of key presidential voting states last week, made clear that if he gets into the race he intends to run, essentially, as Biden without the baggage. Chris Schwartz, a Black Hawk county supervisor who hosted an event for Brown in Iowa, introduced him by ticking off a list of votes — including opposing NAFTA, opposing the Defense of Marriage Act and voting against authorization of the war in Iraq — that had featured Biden on the other side.
At one point, he insisted he was enjoying himself. I'm not ranting and raving — I love this, he said. I'm having a good time doing this.
Kushner's ambitions are grand: At least to start, the team plans to focus its attention on re-imagining Veterans Affairs; modernizing the technology and data infrastructure of every federal department and agency; remodeling workforce-training programs; and developing 'transformative projects' under the banner of Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan, such as providing broadband Internet service to every American. In some cases, the office could direct that government functions be privatized, or that existing contracts be awarded to new bidders.
— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.
Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said the debate over how to address taxes in the bill is being fairly hotly discussed and litigated among GOP senators. While he stressed that nothing has been finalized, Thune said that the direction I think a lot of our members want to move is to keep some of the Obamacare taxes in place and use the revenue in other parts of the bill.
It's time to incubate new ideas, have those internal debates about the right course of action and do so in a way that allows Democrats to move with relative dispatch if they were to win the White House in the next election, University of Michigan law professor Nick Bagley told me.
Shahid also criticized Pelosi on Twitter for her comments about Ocasio-Cortez, a lawmaker his group helped elect.
The archdiocese issued a statement calling the vaccine morally compromised because it uses cells that were originally derived from tissue from an aborted fetus in the 1970s. The cells are clones and not the original fetal tissue, Religion News Service's Jack Jenkins reports.
RUBIO: ... And, we're not going to do that to our country...
Democrats are vowing to step up outreach efforts to reach non-filers, like the Biden administration has for disbursing the stimulus payments, through nonprofits and other outreach groups. But it is unclear how many families will be able to navigate the new online system.
Jan. 18. Kaiser Health News holds an event on what's in store for health care in 2018 on
As Trump continued to do well, though, Cruz's apparent plan to start peeling away voters from other groups never really gained enough momentum. People dropped out; Cruz gained. The graph above shows how Cruz kept accumulating support. But Trump gained faster.
Andrew Yang: And how much of them were about $1,000 a month?
-- The neighborhood where the attack occurred, Finsbury Park, was considered a hotbed of Islamist extremism. Adam Taylor reports: A relatively deprived immigrant neighborhood in North London, it was the home of the Finsbury Park Mosque — infamous for housing the radical Egyptian cleric known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was later extradited to the United States and found guilty of terrorism charges. But like many of its surrounding neighborhoods, the area has rapidly gentrified in recent years, arguably becoming both more diverse and tolerant at the same time. Kebab shops sit comfortably next to cafes serving flat white espressos. Finsbury Park Mosque has undergone its own dramatic reforms over the previous decade, too, with its extremist edges stripped away.
But in these early states, where impeachment rarely comes up among the questions that candidates are asked, there is no substitute for being there to answer the ones that people do raise. Two precious weeks remain, and the voters who might matter the most have yet to be convinced.
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.
Tenney said Trump's tax cuts had paid for themselves in six months and wondered why no one was covering this story. Maybe because it's totally wrong.
Barr said he was motivated to write the report because he was worried that Mueller might be interpreting a law that forbids the destruction of evidence to obstruct justice to say that any act to influence a proceeding may be a crime if it's done with a bad intent.
KELLY: How flexible are you on this issue?
The previous administration looked very closely at the hardship exemption to make sure it was serving the people who needed the exemption, Peck told me.
-- Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos claimed the National Enquirer attempted to extort him by threatening to publish intimate photos of him unless he dropped an investigation into the tabloid. Paul Farhi, Sarah Ellison and Devlin Barrett report: In an extraordinary post to the online publishing platform Medium, Bezos said the Enquirer and its parent company, American Media Inc., made the threat after he began investigating how the tabloid obtained text messages that revealed his relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, wrote that the Enquirer wanted him to make a false public statement that he and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, 'have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI's coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.' Bezos declined to do so.
Brafford dislikes Trump, but he worries that his party's nonstop attacks on the president hurt politically. That's why he finds Buttigieg's calls for civility so compelling. We have been uncivil in this party, said Brafford. It may drive some middle-of-the-roaders to stay at home. It has turned some people off.
Orders to cater to the owner's desires weighed heavily on many OAN journalists. Several said they left because of the channel's slant. In a parting email last year, producer Kyle Warnke said he was leaving because he was disappointed in our bloated coverage of Donald Trump. It's obvious why we cling to him: He brings in eyeballs and he's clearly friendly to our station. But we're not treating him like we treat the other candidates in the 2016 race, even his Republican rivals.
-- Republican activist Angie Caswell, 42, wandered outside to engage with these protesters. She earnestly wanted to understand how they could possibly think Obamacare was working. Her deductibles have skyrocketed in recent years, she said, and she's heard horror stories about doctors going out of business. I only know one person who has benefited from Obamacare, she said.
A Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations but not authorized to comment publicly on them said that the issue rocketed to the top of the party's priority list after Trump's comments Wednesday.
— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
The same proved true the 2013 shutdown, which reportedly cost the economy at least $24 billion or half a percentage point of the gross domestic product but cost Republicans nothing.
Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.
Under the Affordable Care Act championed by President Barack Obama, Washington encouraged states to allow more people to enroll in Medicaid by offering to pick up most of the tab. Thirty-two states, including Maryland, and the District accepted the offer.
The Department of Health and Human Services appears to have used a financial maneuver that allowed officials to spend the money without telling Congress, and the agency got permission from its top lawyer to do so, Rachel Cohrs reports. Now, the Biden administration is refusing to say whether the outlay means there will be less money available for hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and other providers.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee holds a hearing on Unique Challenges Women Face in Global Health on Feb. 5.
I'm leaving it the way it is, Trump said of Medicare in a Fox Business interview this week. I'm going to bring jobs back to the country. We're going to make our country rich again.
Jan. 15. Brookings India and Tufts University hold a roundtable on 'Opportunities for India Beyond 2019: The Future of Health and Geopolitics' on
And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.
It seems the one sliver of respect that Trump has afforded McCain is to avoid directly naming the senator when mocking him.
We lost 1 in 4 auto manufacturing jobs over the last few decades.
Female activists are setting their sights on the No. 2 spot.
-- Bernie Sanders asked his surrogates to respectfully engage opponents and avoid bullying and harassment of any kind. HuffPost's Daniel Marans reports: During the 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders and his supporters endured criticism from backers of Hillary Clinton for the online vitriol they alleged was directed at them by some of his partisans. ... Sanders in his Saturday email said employing divisive rhetoric would be particularly counter-productive given his campaign's bottom-line goal of unseating [Trump], who is notorious for his bullying and bigotry.
1. Will Congress make extra payments to Obamacare insurers through cost-sharing reduction payments or reinsurance?
Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.
We also find that politicians are no better than citizens in other ways. For example, they adhere more to policy choices that are presented as the status quo. They are equally susceptible to framing effects, meaning that they change their policy choices depending on whether the question is phrased in ways that emphasize the potential gains or the potential losses, even if the choices don't change. And they discount the future at least as steeply as citizens. In other words, given similar policy outcomes or budgetary payoffs, they strongly prefer those that are offered now over those that require waiting, especially if they are told that there will be elections during the wait.
WHO STANDS TO GAIN: [While] both parties draw [district] lines to their own advantage … Republicans have more to lose because they control so many more state legislatures, Barnes writes. The RNC and a dozen large Republican states have asked the court to reverse the Wisconsin decision.
One year ago Saturday, though, Trump made a commitment to the public about another Web-based solution to the problem.
The 21 states are just some of the parties — including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights — that have vowed to sue over the rule, which was published Monday in the Federal Register, Ariana reports.
Klobuchar, whose positions are broadly more centrist than Warren's, gave a similar answer in the opening moments.
On this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats, Harris said. (Her campaign soon tweeted a picture of Harris as a child.)
The furious push reflects the administration's sense of vulnerability on an issue that Democrats successfully used in 2018 to win control of the House of Representatives. White House officials are eager to inoculate the president against a repeat of that strategy in 2020 — and reduce the GOP disadvantage on an issue that pollsters say plays to Democratic strengths. Health care is already playing a starring role in the Democratic presidential debates, with most of the candidates making proposals, including Medicare-for-all plans, key to their campaigns.
Governor Northam is encouraged by Senator Wagner's openness to a compromise that expands health coverage to thousands of Virginians who need it, Northam spokesman Brian Coy said via email. As the Senator notes, expanding Medicaid will allow Virginia to invest in other key priorities like health care, education and pay raises for teachers and law enforcement officers.
Keishawn turned from me to his grandfather. He's a racist? he asked quizzically.
We have learned serious lessons from the past, said McKesson chief executive John Hammergren. Our systems today are automated and not subjective.
He explained that the long commute every Sunday to get back to Washington, D.C. from his home with his wife and three kids in Connecticut didn't bother him as much until last year when his wife was hit by a car and slightly fractured her knee, Angelica writes.

• Trump: 'I don't support WikiLeaks' (He loved it in 2016.) (CNN, April 2017).
I have always said we should be focused on providing the families trapped in Obamacare with as much relief as possible — as soon as possible, Rep. Peter Roskam said in a response to the planned executive action. The administration's decision to broaden the hardship exemption will deliver much-needed relief from the mandate.
One of the thorniest topics Barr will have to address Tuesday is a 19-page memo he sent the Justice Department that was highly critical of Mueller pursuing an obstruction case. Of particular interest to Democrats: with whom did Barr discuss that memo, and when?
As mentioned at the top, the most potentially troublesome aspects of the bill released on Monday aren't even known yet: the price tag and the number of people who will lose coverage.
Tenney, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a radio interview, Already the so-called deficit with the tax cuts — which you're never going to see the left wing or the left-wing media talk about — we've already eclipsed that.
The 2020 Democrats pounced on the administration's move much more quickly than they reacted to the end of the Mueller investigation, with all the candidates sounding pretty much the same note.
Over and over again, the impeachment managers implored the senators to consider the message they wanted to send to Americans about the character of the country, our colleagues write.
When we started working on it there was literally no action on the Republican side, Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at AEI, told me. No talking about paid leave, forget about coming up with a bill.
Asked if he could guarantee witnesses will be called, McConnell said that matter would be discussed after the Senate votes to proceed — not before. 'The way it works, at the risk of being redundant, is that 51 senators determine what we do, and there will be, I'm sure, an intense discussion . . . about the whole witness issue,' McConnell said. 'The people calling the witnesses won't necessarily be us; it will be the prosecution or the defense.' … Pelosi's refusal to transmit the articles ... has also spurred a number of Republican senators to craft legislation and strategize about how they could begin the trial without the House's blessing. But McConnell, speaking privately to his members, made clear that he would not make any moves on a trial until the articles had been formally transmitted.
After Hatch announces that he plans to retire, Romney announces that he will run for the Utah seat.
If you want to know why Senate Republicans even dared to propose a health-care bill like the one unveiled today, if you want to know why Hillary Clinton lost in November and Jon Ossoff lost in the congressional race in George this week, it is because they couldn't come up with simple, powerful messages like that.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has stressed it must be a central part of the administration's response to the opioid crisis, and in February the FDA issued guidance praising the effectiveness of buprenorphine and giving advice on how pharmaceutical makers could get more such medications approved.
There's a precedent for this type of move: Two decades ago, several countries, including Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, issued compulsory licenses for HIV/AIDS drugs, which allowed governments to waive some intellectual property rights, and resulted in a dramatic increase in access to the drugs.
McCain has mostly kept his recent criticism of the president to policy. But his daughter Meghan McCain, who has become a kind of spokeswoman for the family, recently called Trump's repeated, onstage mockeries of her father gross.
With a Biden-Harris Administration and a Senate Democratic majority, the challenges we face won't get any less tough—but we've finally got the opportunity to face them head on and start taking action, Murray said. I can't wait to start getting things done.
The furlough, Tabaddor said, undermines the integrity of the court and highlights yet another way the immigration system has been pulled into a policy debate it should be immune from.
Over the past four months, President Trump has regularly sought to downplay the coronavirus threat with a mix of facts and false statements. (The Washington Post)
Here's how the system works: Insurers like CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group and Humana submit estimates of how much providing Medicare's prescription drug benefit will cost them, and Medicare in turn uses that estimate to make payments to the insurers.
The group's alleged role in the attack has not previously been reported, and officials from the governments of North Korea, the United States and Spain declined to comment on it.
— ICYMI: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized in late December its overhaul of Medicare's so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) program — and the agency followed through on stricter rules that could expose these health savings cooperatives to losses sooner. The Health 202 detailed the proposed new rules here.
Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) and David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) detailed the timeline of Trump's actions as the attacks were unfolding, highlighted his repeated refusal to halt the siege:
In the next few weeks Sanders is planning to reintroduce a modified version of his Medicare-for-all bill, a measure that would establish a single-payer, government-run health care program. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), appearing on the same program, fired back, saying that approach would ruin the entire system.
This is a war on a century's worth of work to keep our air and water clean; our food, drugs and workplaces safe; the rights of employees protected; and the marketplace fair and unrigged. … Trump and Bannon are happy to expand the reach of the state when it comes to policing, immigration enforcement … and the browbeating of individual companies that offend the president in one way or another. The parts of government they want to dismantle are those that stand on the side of citizens against powerful interests.
OUCH: The 12th case of coronavirus in the U.S. was confirmed in Wisconsin on Wednesday. China has reported more than 560 coronavirus deaths and 28,000 confirmed cases.
After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress! (April 2 tweet)
In Kentucky and Mississippi, the Republican governors signed bills that prohibit doctors from performing abortions after fetal heartbeats are detected, but Kentucky's heartbeat law was blocked in court the same day it was enacted. In Mississippi, abortion-rights advocates want the same to happen in the state, where a federal judge last year struck down a less-restrictive law that would have banned most abortions 15 weeks into pregnancy, Jacob writes.
Yet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.
House votes may extend through next week and the following one, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters on Wednesday.
Shelley Powers remembers vividly the low-level fear that was always with her in the days before the ACA. Without health insurance, she worried that a slip or a car crash would send her to the emergency room and into bankruptcy because of the enormous bills.
The Trump administration ordered an end to family separations but has offered no plan to reunite the more than 2,300 children it separated from their parents. (Jon Gerberg, Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post)
From those conversations, which have occurred among strategists, officials and donors in Arizona and Washington, a long list of names has emerged of possible interim or long-term successors, including McCain's wife, Cindy, and former senator Jon Kyl. … While some close observers contend there is gray area in the way the election laws are written, most agree that if May 30 comes and goes without any vacancy, there would be no election this year and the [Arizona governor's] appointment, should there eventually be one, would serve through 2020.
Miller's name has been circulating as a possible VA head since then-White House doctor Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration following allegations of misconduct. Miller led the VA panel during a tumultuous time for the agency, when it was found to have generated long wait times for veterans -- an issue leading to the 2014 resignation of Eric Shinseki, who led VA under President Barack Obama.
Jayapal cited Frederick Douglass's observation: Power concedes nothing without a demand. It might well be the slogan of the Sanders movement. Its task now is to elect a president open to its demands and responsive to its hopes. With his decision, Sanders made it as clear as he could that Donald Trump will never be that person.
There are almost 156 million people with jobs. But only 251,000 people had two full-time jobs in February, compared with 343,000 in February 2018, according to BLS. That's a decline of more than 25 percent. Another 4.5 million had both a full-time job and a part-time job, while nearly 2 million were juggling part-time jobs.
You know, the big print giveth, the small print taketh away. I'm looking for the small print at this point, said a cautious Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) as he exited the lunch. Heller is up for reelection in a purple state that expanded Medicaid under the ACA.
One surmises this is a bait-and-switch designed to keep pressure up on Trump to go through with mass deportations more broadly, not necessarily of the dreamers.
While we work hard to remove content that violates our policies, we also give our community tools to control what they see as well as use Facebook to speak up and share perspectives with the community around them, Facebook said in an emailed statement. If the content they're posting crosses the line and violates our policies, we would remove the content as soon as we become aware of it.
Fully fund the construction of an impenetrable physical wall along the southern border with Mexico. The wall will be one foot taller than the Great Wall of China and artistically beautiful, constructed of hardened concrete, rebar and steel. The wall might cover only about 1,000 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile border because of natural barriers, and Trump is open to using fencing in some places. (The portion of wall that has been built is not impenetrable, and it's not nearly as expansive as Trump pledged.)
I think it's going to go very well, he said yesterday afternoon. I'll be very surprised if it doesn't.
Regarding the president-elect's schedule today, he had his daily intelligence briefing this morning. He then has a meeting with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to discuss the issues pertaining to vaccines and immunizations. I'm going to leave it to most of you to realize (ph) how he saw Kennedy.
If the Democrats — when it explodes, which it will soon — if they got together with us and got a real health-care bill, I'd be totally open to it, and I think that's going to happen, he said.
This shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.
Democrats are also promising to appoint a 'price gouging' enforcer who would fine drug companies if their price increases surpass certain thresholds — another piece they believe will show voters that Democrats are prepared to tackle the issue in a way Trump hasn't, Erica and Carolyn write. There's no question that it provides an opening for us, top House Ways and Means Democrat Richard Neal (Mass.) told them.
Yang and Buttigieg both spoke out against Trump's tariffs, with the South Bend mayor underscoring his status as a Midwesterner who lives in a state with a large agricultural industry.
When will Republicans have a bill they can rally around?
Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) called the administration's position a sick joke, and pointedly queried: 'Will you encourage the Trump administration to change its position?' Hassan challenged Azar, a lawyer and former HHS general counsel. He replied that 'we do believe in finding solutions on the matter of preexisting conditions and the matter of affordability, regardless of the litigation.'
Mike Deaver, who had crafted Reagan's public image as one of the president's longtime top strategists, was convicted of perjury in 1987 for lying under oath during a hearing that Dingell called to investigate influence peddling.
-- France also continues to address the outcome of Sunday's parliamentary elections, which left Marine Le Pen's far-right party almost completely shut out of power. James McAuley reports: The populist fervor that swept Britain and the United States never reached the same pitch in France … While Le Pen had hoped that her party might serve as the principal opposition to Macron's majority, the National Front earned only eight of the 577 parliamentary seats, according to totals from Sunday's second round of voting. The result was particularly stunning given that the party had gotten more than one-third of the votes cast in the final round of the presidential election. There was, however, a silver lining: a seat for Le Pen herself, a small but symbolic victory that some said would enshrine the far-right leader in France's political establishment.
Lee Hockstader: So then how do you manage these tensions that have clearly arisen in society, partly from the level of immigration that's gone up so much in 40 years?
Current and former government officials say it would be a tall order for any president to execute massive new programs in a matter of weeks, and tens of millions of Americans did receive direct deposits worth $1,200 or more this week. But the Trump administration's promise of swift and effective action — President Trump called the small business program flawlessly executed this week — is colliding with a federal and state apparatus not well designed to deliver so much money so fast.
CRUZ: Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn't make you a tough guy. We need a commander-in-chief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration. He passed tax reform and regulatory reform. The economy took off. It generated millions in high-paying jobs, trillions in new revenue. He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.
If many of those ideas never made it into law, allies credited Ryan with advancing the debate.
The answer is, I think we shut down the industry if they're causing addiction and if the evidence is that people are getting sick as a result or inhaling a lot of bad stuff, Sanders said in a response to a question about the youth vaping crisis.
Alec Baldwin was back for SNL's cold open:
Harris calls out Biden on race: The sharpest exchange of the debate centered on race, when Harris, the only black candidate on the stage, called out Biden for his comments at a recent fundraiser where he bragged about his relationship with segregationist senators early in his career.
For the Biden administration it won't just be about reversing Trump policies on Medicaid; appointees will also be seeking ways to expand the program.
In 2017 , 31 percent of the enrollees were new. But the share of new enrollees fell to 27 percent last year and for this year , just 24 percent are buying plans for the first time.
But if the House wanted to, it could pass legislation effectively reinstating the tax by raising the penalty from zero dollars to one dollar. Or it could pass bills making clear Congress intended for the rest of the ACA to stand with or without the mandate to buy coverage (this was another big question in the 2012 case). Those actions would take the legs out of the lawsuit, which contends Obamacare can't exist without the individual mandate.
That won't stop Democrats, who run both houses of the state's General Court, from introducing the bill later this year. But the reform's supporters acknowledged that they might not get another bite at the apple until this autumn, just a few months before the primary. And even then, they'd need buy-in from some skeptics in their party.
Whether that will actually happen is unclear. Republicans say the fallout from Ryan's departure is going as smoothly as it possibly could. At least half a dozen high-profile potential candidates have decided not to run. But that has cleared the field for an organized former Ryan staff member, University of Wisconsin Regent Bryan Steil, to become the likely nominee. Wisconsin Republicans who spoke to The Fix universally praised Steil.
From the president of the NAACP:
A lot of what the president is interested in talking about, particularly in the tweets, are unrelated to what we're trying to accomplish here, he said. And I would rather see he and all of us stay on message as much as possible.
The head of the snake is outside the country, and the place to fight this aggressively is at the source more than on the street corner, Barr said. I used to say we could stack up generation after generation of people in prison and it'll still keep on coming.
Shortly after arriving at Seattle's international airport, he began feeling ill and reached out to his health-care provider on Sunday. Local, state and federal officials quickly collected samples and sent them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing, our colleagues write. … Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, said the risk posed by the virus to the general American population is low but that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk.
The move immediately tees up a potential messaging battle between Democratic proposals for Medicare-for-all — castigated by Republicans as a socialist boondoggle — and a kind of Medicare-for-less approach focused on cutting back on spending, from the GOP.
Of course, Zika's effects were comparatively limited. In contrast, the covid-19 emergency is highly salient, national, exponentially growing – putting lives and the economy at risk. Given volatile stock markets and the limited firepower of the Federal Reserve's interventions, both parties face increasing pressure to act quickly. No surprise then that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) quickly backtracked after announcing that senators would go home as scheduled for a week's recess without acting on the emergency measure.
Harris first asked Barr whether he'd reverse the Justice Department's position and defend the law in court. Barr said he wanted to look into it.
No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.

Friday. The Alliance or Health Policy holds an event on state opportunities to address prescription drug costs in Medicaid on
Congress is working on its fourth covid-19 bill, and it must address these coverage gaps. It should overrule Trump and create a special enrollment period for all ACA marketplaces and increase the subsidies offered. The bill also should incentivize the 14 remaining states to expand Medicaid, by putting it all on the federal government's tab — that is, without states paying any portion of the costs for a period. And Congress should subsidize COBRA payments for those who qualify and eliminate all surprise bills and cost-sharing for covid-19-related expenses.
KELLY: ... But, what happened was...
The longer the period between repeal and replace is, the more the market unravels, Claxton said. And you've blown up the bridge behind you, and you're heading into battle, you can't go backwards. You've gotta figure it out, or else things get really bad.
QUESTION: (inaudible) could you provide some more details? Who's preparing them for the president-elect to sign once he's sworn in? And any update on the status of the -- of more White House hirings of key position like staff secretary, other hirings within the (inaudible)? When should we expect those?
Generics were also a priority for Gottlieb's predecessor, Rob Califf, who was troubled by the massive backlog of generic drug applications, a list that reached longer than 2,800 pending applications in 2012. The backlog is now down to the low 100s, according to Gottlieb, but he wants to essentially eliminate it so companies can obtain immediate review once they apply.
During the hearing, New York Times reporter Peter Baker tweeted the text of the 2017 email from Barr, in which Barr wrote that he has long believed that the predicate for investigating the uranium deal, as well as the foundation, is far stronger than any basis for investigating so-called 'collusion.' 
There are two types of ailments patients say are associated with implants. There is breast implant illness, which is a set of autoimmune problems like joint and muscle pain and allergies and fatigue. An uncommon lymphoma has also been linked to the implants.
As the process unfolds, the pressure on McConnell is expected to intensify. Several Republican senators — including Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine), the latter of whom is expected to face a tough reelection fight — have either expressed misgivings about their leader's intentions or said directly that they want key witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton, to testify.
They will be able to buy, they'll be able to cross state lines and they will get great competitive health care and it will cost the United States nothing, Trump said in October 2017. With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself.
Coons took Barr through a thought experiment of when and how Trump's potential actions to deflect scrutiny of himself would run afoul of the law. Could he offer to pardon a member of his administration to prevent negative testimony about illegal acts? No, Barr said — if a pardon was offered as a quid pro quo to alter testimony, then that would definitely be obstruction of justice under the law.
Calling it 'a constitutional position . . . not a policy position,' Azar sidestepped grilling on whether he agreed with a legal brief filed last week by Justice Department attorneys stating they would not defend the Affordable Care Act in a federal lawsuit by Texas and 19 other Republican-led states, Amy reports.
While Congress may address this issue soon, the lapse underscores the broader vulnerability of Puerto Rico's economy, as well as key parts of its safety net, to the whims of an increasingly hostile federal government with which it has feuded over key priorities, Jeff and Josh write. Puerto Rico will again need the federal government's help to stave off drastic cuts to Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor and disabled, as well as for the disbursement of billions in hurricane relief aid that has not yet been turned over to the island.
Medicaid is crucial when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth, financing more than 4 in 10 births in the United States. State programs are required to cover women not otherwise eligible for at least 60 days after giving birth, but after that point women can become uninsured — particularly if they're living in a state without expanded Medicaid.
But Democrats see a vulnerability. At a campaign rally in St. Louis on Monday, Sanders seized on Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's reluctance to promise that a coronavirus vaccine would be available to the public at an affordable price.
Was Trump's State of the Union address bipartisan?
Bloomberg did not endorse any candidate in 2008. He wrote an op-ed for Bloomberg View in the waning days of the 2012 campaign endorsing Obama, but later called it backhanded at a Goldman Sachs event in 2016.
A CNN poll published last night included a red flag for Democrats in this area. Overall, enthusiasm about voting in the next election is higher than it's been at any time since the start of the century. Four in 10 Americans said they are extremely enthusiastic about casting a ballot for president. But unlike last year's midterm elections, when Democratic enthusiasm propelled the party to a majority in the House of Representatives, the energy now is higher among Republicans, according to CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. Nearly 6 in 10 self-identified Republicans (57%) say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president, compared with 46% among Democrats and 26% among independents.
WINNERS: Klobuchar, Biden and Buttigieg during the first half
Health insurers have agreed to reach out to seniors in underserved communities — including those who are racial minorities or who live in low-income areas — to help answer their questions about the coronavirus vaccines, schedule them for appointments to get immunized and transport them to those appointments.
Rail crews in Chicago set parts of its commuter train tracks on fire to prevent damage from the extreme cold:
McConnell is hoping to bring the bill to a vote next week, after it receives a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO will estimate how many people could lose coverage under the plan and what impact it would have on insurance premiums and the federal budget deficit.
Legislation from the House Energy and Commerce Committee offers the dozen states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare a fresh new incentive to do so. Under the proposal released late last night, the federal government would cover an extra 5 percent of costs for all of their Medicaid enrollees – not just the expansion population – if states agreed to expand the program. The extra contributions would last two years.
CRUZ: ... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?
Nick Bagley, a health law professor at the University of Michigan:
Thursday The American Enterprise Institute holds an event on New thinking about poverty and economic mobility on
Sanders's plan proposes moving every American in the country onto a single government-run insurer that charges no deductibles or premiums. Doing so would massively increase government expenditures -- by as much as $33 trillion by 2031, according to Blahous's report -- while offering health insurance to the Americans who currently lack it and preventing millions more from being forced into medical bankruptcy. It would require enormous tax increases to finance, although Sanders maintains they would be offset by zeroing out every family's spending on premiums and deductibles.
So to drugmakers — particularly those that sell the drugs available under Part B — such a change could represent big losses for them.
Not only is this a poor political move, this decision hurts real people who will unfairly lose their health insurance coverage as a result, Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) said in a statement to The Health 202. We need to work to find ways to fix our health-care system – not blow it up.
This blindsided the world. And I think we've handled it very, very well.
While repeal has run into trouble, make no mistake: The undermining and repeal of large chunks of the law is still moving forward, and what happens after that remains a mystery.
Reduce the number of legal immigrants because it is simply too large to perform adequate screening, and these immigrants could be taking jobs away from American workers. (The number was sharply reduced, although Trump also promised to increase them at other points — as detailed below.)
But Tuesday, Warren joined 42 other Democrats in voting present on the Green New Deal. Four members of the caucus — Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Maine Sen. Angus King, and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — voted no.
As a politically active nonprofit organization, Concerned Veterans for America is not required to disclose the names of its donors. Koch officials declined to respond to the suggestion that the group's financial backers would profit from the outsourcing of veterans' care.
But Trump's proposed Medicare savings are more than three times as large as those in his previous budget, and industry lobbying groups said the reductions would hurt hospitals and seniors.
Listen closely and you'll notice that supporters of this bill — such as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) — are championing it even while cautioning that many big changes to health care are yet to come. That's code for reconciliation.
Nevertheless, Bluey acknowledged that the Signal's editorial independence has been questioned before, most prominently by the congressional Periodical Press Gallery, a journalist-run operation that credentials journalists to cover Congress.
Charging premiums or co-pays that total no more than 5 percent of an enrollee's income.
Trump's efforts to remake the federal judiciary are also moving apace, including his nomination Friday of a 37-year-old judge to fill a vacancy on the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Romney's proposal would provide $4,200 per year for every child up to the age of 6, as well as $3,000 per year for every child age 6 to 17, Jeff Stein reports.
Biden should address gun reform by evaluating how people buy guns, instituting stronger background checks and creating gun buyback programs to eliminate the use of military-grade weapons. I believe that people have the right to bear arms, as stated in the Second Amendment, but we as a country need to reassess what level of armament is excessive.
Biden will hold a bipartisan meeting on cancer at 1:45 p.m. He will later meet virtually with the House Democratic Caucus at 5 p.m.
The executives did display some regret. Cardinal Health executive chairman George Barrett said he's sorry the company didn't act more quickly to halt the sending of millions of hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to pharmacies in West Virginia.
That ought to tell you something, Wyden said about the companies' refusal. Even the Big Tobacco companies were willing to come to Congress and testify, and they made a product that kills people. They all lied to me, but at least they showed up...The drugmakers are going to have to show up as well.
I work in one of the poorest counties in Michigan, and my patients depend on expanded Medicaid, so how is that going to affect my patients? Davidson, a former Democratic congressional candidate, asked politely.
I already put the word out.
Jan. 16. Politico hosts an event on health care innovators on
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) whose office also did not respond to request for comment, has whose office also did not respond to request for comment, has not issued a public position on the filibuster.
So while congressional Republicans have halted their efforts to dismantle Obamacare, the health-care law remains ever the political football – with the Trump administration claiming it is providing consumers with more affordable options and Democrats accusing it of sabotaging the law.
— The White House has pushed back against speculation about Trump's health, but the president and his staff appear fine with questioning the mental fitness of others. Yesterday, Trump unleashed his fury on his former chief strategist and campaign manager Steve Bannon, issuing a long and unusual statement questioning Bannon's mental stability, honesty and political influence.
Jay Loftin, president of Logic Technology Development, said the business practices of some manufacturers have caused tremendous damage to the reputation of this important category but did not mention names. I do not wish to be painted with the same brush as others.
I understood what he was trying to do. I didn't really appreciate it, he said.
The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee holds a hearing on pending legislation.
The run-up to this year's American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference was dominated by three topics: the condemnation of Rep. Ilhan Omar over tweets and remarks she made about Israel's influence in Washington, an AIPAC donor's accusation that Omar was a terrorist, and a push by MoveOn to make sure the 2020 Democrats skipped the event.
Andrew Yang: That's not all. What we have to do is regenerate our global leadership role through investing in our historic partnerships and alliances. If we want to improve China's treatment of its ethnic minorities, which is reprehensible, to me, you could go it alone or you could try and build an international consensus around it. I would go for path No. 2, and I would actually try and strengthen that consensus in ways that would be important to the Chinese, which is why I'm proposing a world data organization that's analogous to the [World Trade Organization]. If you look at our recent past, China modified its behavior significantly because it thought it was important to join the WTO. And that ended up being positive in some ways for the rest of the world. We need to bring similar pressure in their use of technology and data. And if the Chinese feel like they need to conform to certain standards in order to achieve their economic goals, then they'll be much more likely to actually feel pressure to pull back in some of their abuses. So I don't want to relinquish American global leadership. I want to rebuild American global leadership by actually strengthening our alliances and partnerships and let our friends know that Donald Trump is not forever. We're here and open for business.
$4.6 trillion in infrastructure spending at minimum.
I'm not a doctor, so I don't know what to call it, but I know that this thing where Trump lives rent-free in people's brains is a thing, said Matt Schlapp, a confidant of the former president.

Drop that dirty, rotten traitor Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane into desolate Afghanistan without a parachute. Trump has also suggested that Bergdahl be shot. (Neither has occurred.)
Some GOP conservatives argue that the U.S. Treasury can prioritize paying some obligations and not others — meaning that a default might not be so bad. And House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.) in 2015 revealed that Treasury and the Federal Reserve had run exercises to test whether the government could pay interest to its bondholders first, so that the government would not technically stiff its creditors.

In fact, Trump's broader efforts to undermine independent oversight may have accelerated amid a crisis that has ravaged the economy and pushed Congress to spend trillions of dollars in stimulus.
Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.
I met with the leaders of health insurance industry, who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments.
The new initiative will focus on 48 counties and seven states where new HIV infections are concentrated, Amy reports. Teams of HIV health workers — CDC employees or working through CDC grants — will fan out into such communities, trying to encourage residents at risk of HIV to get tested and to start preventive medicine or, if they test positive, to go on drug regimens to lessen their chances of getting sick or spreading the virus, she writes.
Such the problem with making Medicare-for-all. Yes, if we were starting from scratch, of course we'd opt for a government-funded national health system, just like every other advanced country. But the reality is that for most Americans, our system of private doctors, private hospitals and private insurance is working pretty well. Despite the best efforts of Republicans to sabotage it, Obamacare has demonstrated that universal coverage can be achieved, and medical costs brought under control, which in the end is what we care about. Why take the very real political and policy risks of blowing everything up and starting again?
RUBIO: And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative. To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage.

Other countries in the region also are reporting more people infected — nearly all of them tourists from China. North Korea is calling the fight against the coronavirus a matter of 'national existence' amid fears over what an outbreak would do to a country with a rudimentary health infrastructure and a malnourished population. The UAE has reported its first cases — the first in the Middle East — members of a family traveling from Wuhan. Germany reported three new cases late Tuesday, while Thailand confirmed six more. Hong Kong reported two new cases Wednesday. … Two more coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, bringing to seven the number of people in the country confirmed as having the virus that originated in central China. …

Politico reports: All three senators remain undecided … But they could end up with a creative solution. One or more senators may end up splitting their votes, borrowing a move from Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), who voted for the abuse of power charge but against the one on obstruction of Congress. … Manchin insisted Tuesday he hasn't figured out where he will come down. And won't until the trial ends. … There's no chatter in the caucus about anyone other than Jones, Sinema or Manchin … although a number of other Democratic senators say they are still undecided.

I understand why we should have stricter borders but I don't like the way he's going about it. Both she and Barrett mentioned their objections to Trump's plan to end DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects undocumented immigrants brought here as children.
To be sure, $8 million is mere pocket change for CMS. But the dollars could be instrumental for states — especially small ones — seeking to dial down health benefits insurers are required to cover under Obamacare. For example, states could use their share to hire an actuary or a clinician to form leaner coverage requirements for, say, maternity care or mental health services, to replace the benchmark plans they currently have in place.

Thirty-one percent of respondents to an Economist/YouGov poll agreed that Trump kept his campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Those most likely to believe Obamacare has been repealed include those over age 64 (38 percent) and those who vote Republican (44 percent). Just 49 percent of those polled answered correctly that Trump largely hasn't kept his promise to repeal the ACA.
There was a very similar moving of the goal posts during special counsel Bob Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, as Trump defenders went from insisting that there were no Trump campaign Russian contacts to arguing that there was nothing wrong with talking to the Russians.
-- The virus is spreading rapidly. So is misinformation about it. Kim Bellware reports: Since the first cases of a then-unidentified pneumonia were reported in late December, hoaxes, half-truths and flat-out lies have proliferated, mostly through social media. BuzzFeed News for several days kept a running list of misinformation, including wildly inaccurate reports that the death toll in China was 112,000 as of late January (reality: around 80 at the time); claims that Chinese people eating bats were the source of the outbreak (a viral photo of a woman biting a bat was not taken in China); and false suggestions that the virus was lab-engineered as a kind of bioweapon.
President Trump commented on the global coronavirus outbreak at a USMCA celebration speech in Michigan on Jan. 30. (The Washington Post)
Eliminate [the Affordable Care Act's] individual mandate, as no person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. (The individual mandate in the legislation was repealed, although the broader law was not.)
-- In response to Russia's threat, the Pentagon rapidly moved to re-establish deconfliction practices with Russia. The Hill's Ellen Mitchell reports: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford on Monday said the United States will try 'in the next few hours' to re-establish deconfliction arrangements between Russia and the United States following the U.S. downing of a Syrian military jet over the weekend. 'An incident occurred, we have to work through the incident, we have a channel to be able to do that and I think it's going to require some diplomatic and military engagement in the next few hours to restore the deconfliction that we've had in place,' Dunford said at a forum at the National Press Club in Washington.
In sum, not a lot of what Trump emphasized in the campaign will likely come to fruition by 2018. And if it does, Democrats will make hay out of those who come out worse off as a result of replacing Obamacare and point to gains by the rich in the tax plan.
But Northam boasts some advantages. He has the support of every Democrat in the General Assembly and of Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, who will help roust voters for the primary, which is likely to see low turnout. And despite Perriello's rapid fundraising — he pulled in a field-leading $2.2 million between January and March — Northam has more cash on hand (over $3 million) and has already begun TV advertising.
That's how much this health-care bill is projected to reduce the deficit over the next decade.
Identify all foreign trading abuses that affect American workers and use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. This would include cracking down on sweatshops in Mexico that undercut U.S. workers. (The NAFTA replacement includes some increased worker protections, though Trump has done little to crack down on human rights abuses more broadly.)
In her dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King, nominated by President Jimmy Carter, wrote that questions about the legality of the individual 'mandate' are purely academic, and people can purchase insurance — or not — as they please.
Trump has already used it three times since February to kill regulations put into effect by the Obama administration: He eliminated the Interior Department's stream protection rule, which barred coal-mining companies from conducting any activities that could permanently pollute streams and other sources of drinking water. He killed an SEC rule requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. And he made it easier for the mentally ill to get guns by blocking the Social Security Administration from turning over certain data to the FBI.
A breakthrough is allegedly at hand, at least according to GOP leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and his Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer (N.Y.). The agreement McConnell and Schumer are contemplating would clear the way for a bipartisan accord that would break through the sharp divides that helped prompt a three-day government shutdown last month, Mike and Erica write. The tentative measure would include two years of funding for community health centers and postpone planned Medicaid cuts to hospitals serving larger shares of the low-income, along with extending some smaller health-care funding streams.

Schumer also told Politico: It's one of the most major pieces of legislation we've done. I guess there are only a few other moments, I suppose. Obamacare. But otherwise you can't think of something so major since the Great Society, Lyndon Johnson.
It's possible that Cruz has decided to soften his pitch to voters in anticipation of official Washington throwing its weight behind him -- and in anticipation of getting the nomination and needing help to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the fall. This is a key stumbling block when it comes to the establishment backing him over Trump: Will Cruz actually be any better? Will he work with them? He's indicating that, yes, he will.

Watch Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) weigh in on Senate Republicans' strategy in working on health care:
Graham has promised to pick up the investigation of so-called FISA abuse where House Republicans left off, despite the fact that Democrats have decried the investigative course as nothing more than a ruse to undermine the foundation of Mueller's probe.
Fleischer pointed out that Bush signed his signature No Child Left Behind education law in January 2002, less than four months after the 9/11 attacks.
But the administration has also tried to peel back the ACA in smaller ways, expanding leaner plans that do not comply with all of its coverage requirements, conducting only limited marketplace outreach and cutting off extra subsidies that help the lowest-
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.
Fiser said he had backed Trump reluctantly in 2016 and would probably do so again in 2020. But he drew a distinction between the president — still an outsider, even after three years in Washington — and the Kentuckian who has walked the halls of Congress for more than three decades.
 Since Trump left office, grass-roots Republican activists and state parties have become his vociferous defenders, condemning and censuring elected Republicans who dare to deviate in any way from full-throated support of the former president, our colleague Michael Scherer reports . That has created a backlash of its own, as some Republicans — even some who eventually may oppose impeachment — are pushing back against local leadership.

As soon as the sound on his mic is turned off, he dives toward the area where those who remain behind are standing to shake his hand or take a selfie. At those moments, Biden is transformed. He lingers with anyone who wants to tell him a story, even as maintenance workers start dismantling his stage and folding up chairs. People light up in his presence. Perhaps because of the personal suffering he has endured, Biden seems to have a kind of radar that draws him to people who are starving for solace and reassurance, and they to him.

WHAT HAS allowed the United States to last for so long as a democracy, when so many other countries have failed? There are many factors, but none is more fundamental than this: When we hold elections, the losing party acknowledges the legitimacy of the winner, and the winner allows the loser to survive to fight another day.
Klein has done his homework in reviewing the extensive academic literature on the subject and interviewing scores of actors immersed in practical politics. The fact of polarization is not in question and it stems from the momentous political realignment that took place after the 1960s. Klein cites a famous study by the American Political Science Association from the 1950s complaining that the Republican and Democratic parties were too similar and didn't offer voters real ideological choices. In those days, the two parties were large coalitions of heterogeneous interest groups. The Democratic Party, in particular, brought together an odd alliance of Northern liberals, working-class trade unionists and Southern segregationists. This changed in the 1960s when the Democrats embraced the civil rights movement, which led to a multigenerational shift by the South toward the Republican Party. The two parties became much more ideological and homogeneous by the early 21st century, such that the most liberal Republican lay to the right of the most conservative Democrat.
The Senate could act on the measure to fund the coronavirus response as soon as today. Trump is expected to sign the legislation, which is more than triple the size of the White House's budget request from last week, Erica Werner and Mike DeBonis report. The vote in the House was 415-2. … The political deal helped push financial markets to surge on Wednesday. The two no votes came from GOP Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.) and Ken Buck (Colo.), who argued that the bill's spending levels were excessive. The package includes more than $3 billion for research and development on vaccines, therapeutics and other treatments, as well as $2.2 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support the response from federal, state, and local public health agencies, including for lab testing and infection control. Other parts of the deal include close to $1 billion for medical supplies, health-care preparedness and community health centers, among other things. Also included is $1 billion in loan subsidies for small businesses … Some 85 percent of the money in the bill would be spent domestically, but there is also $1.25 billion for the State Department to assist in battling the spread of the coronavirus overseas. This would include evacuation expenses and humanitarian aid, among other things.
Sanders does not have much time to change the trajectory of this race. Michigan is one of the six states voting next Tuesday that will collectively award 352 delegates. Biden is expected to win Mississippi, on account of its sizable African American population, though Sanders will fly there on Friday to deliver a speech aimed at black voters. Missouri, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota are the other four prizes.

-- He can't pass legislation to repeal Obamacare, but Trump is weakening the pillars of the health-care system from the inside so that he can blame Democrats for future problems. Although House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged Friday that Obamacare is the law of the land, its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in the president's hands.
Three women who have filed lawsuits in different states charge that surrogacy contracts are exploitative to birth mothers, create a class of women as breeders and commodify children. An attorney for the women said surrogacy contracts prevent a child being placed where it's in the child's best interest. One of them, Melissa Cook, was carrying triplets as a surrogate in 2015 when the intended father asked her to abort at least one of them over financial concerns. Cook refused to do so and has since been fighting for custody of the children.

There's another practice growing increasingly popular in the United States. Drug companies are offering coupons to customers to incentivize them to buy brand-name drugs rather than generics. While these coupons lower consumers' out-of-pocket costs, they ensure their insurance plans pays for more expensive drugs.

When states had high-risk pools, people in those pools represented just 2 percent of the non-group health insurance participants. But given the limitations of those funds, that percentage may not be a good guide for what would happen under the AHCA.

Two-thirds of the cases accuse the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a nearly 73-year-old law that forms the primary bulwark against arbitrary rule. The normal 'win rate' for the government in such cases is about 70 percent, according to analysts and studies. But as of mid-January, a database maintained by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law shows Trump's win rate at about 6 percent. (Here is a breakdown of the cases the Trump administration has lost.)
As under Obamacare, insurance companies could not deny people essential care. But the federal subsidies helping people buy coverage would be more generous, pegged to the gold tier of plans in the current system. The subsidies would scale with income; some people would get free coverage; even at the high end, no one would pay more than 8.5 percent of their income in premiums for a gold plan. People could take this money and buy into a new, government-run plan, or they could purchase coverage from private insurers. Crucially, doctors, hospitals and other providers would be barred from charging private insurers in the new market more than they charge Medicare, which could lower costs dramatically in areas of the country served by only a few providers whose market power allows them to set high rates.

-- Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz had two shots to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's now counting on the third time being the charm. Ruth Eglash and Steve Hendrix report: As the sides slug their way to a third election in less than a year on March 2, political observers say the nonstop campaign has made the former army general an even more formidable opponent. … Even after two general elections failed to produce a clear winner and the Israeli public grew increasingly apathetic, those working for Gantz's Blue and White party appear energized. That could reflect the fact that the party has an edge in the polls, which put Blue and White ahead of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party in the final weeks. That appears to continue an upward trend since the first election last April, when, as a newly formed party, Blue and White came in a close second behind Likud. … Although he was unable to unseat Netanyahu in the previous elections — in part because of Israel's coalition-based parliamentary system — Gantz is now widely viewed as a viable successor to the longtime prime minister.

The court filing is a request to the judge, and will set off a long legal fight. It will add fuel to Democrats' efforts to make healthcare a campaign issue in the mid-term elections. The guarantee that people should be able to buy insurance regardless of their health history has been a popular provision of the divisive law -- one that President Trump has praised, calling the law's prohibition on denying insurance to sick people one of the strongest assets of the ACA in a 60 Minutes interview before he took office.

In 1973, however, in San Antonio Independent School District v.

Some of the harshest critics of this decision have compared the court's willingness to accept government-imposed inequality in schools to Plessy v.

But what that masks is that the labor force participation rate is at 63.2 percent in the United States right now, which is the same levels as Ecuador and Costa Rica.
He seems both politically and personally isolated these days, said David Gergen, a former adviser to Democratic and Republican presidents dating to Richard M. Nixon. He's flailing because he doesn't know where to find his natural allies.
The report notes that children are more likely to be uninsured in states that did not expand Medicaid under Obamacare, which would have extended eligibility to all adults earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line. Studies show that parents in Medicaid are more likely to enroll their children in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, public health plans for families with lower incomes.

Others in the administration wince at presidential tweets. [Pompeo] tells his staff to evaluate each one on whether it can be leveraged into something useful.
--The general feeling among Democrats and liberals is that Alex Azar is a much better choice than Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (even if they don't agree with all of Azar's positions). The former drug executive and HHS official under George W. Bush now has two Democratic backers in the Senate. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp called Azar incredibly competent, in a statement shared with The Health 202.
Thus begins the Democratic push to use Trump as a foil in the quest to win back ground on the state-level.
Senate to vote on Green New Deal, says Majority Leader Mitch McConnell :
There's no evidence that the failures to report caucus results stemmed from anything other than ineptitude, though even that provided fodder for Republicans.
The initiative is part of Congress's sweeping 2018 farm measure, which funds the bulk of the country's agricultural and nutrition programs but has been caught up in partisan controversy over strengthening work requirements for food stamps. House leadership says it's aiming to bring the bill to the floor this month.

A contractor lied to get nearly $40 million in N95 contracts from the government, Rachel Weiner reports.
-- In other tech news, Facebook agreed to overhaul its lucrative targeted ad system amid accusations of discrimination. The social media giant allowed advertisers to micro-target potential customers by using their personal data, but growing evidence indicates that landlords, lenders and employers have abused the information by ruling out candidates based on gender, age and race.

The release of cost estimates could widen fissures between hard-line conservatives, who wish to keep federal spending to a minimum, and the rest of the House GOP, who seem to believe spending will be necessary to prevent turmoil in the insurance markets.
-- The U.S. military acknowledged for the first time over the weekend that it launched an airstrike against ISIS in Mosul, where residents say more than 100 civilians were killed. (Missy Ryan and Loveday Morris)
TRUMP: I have no problem with it.
I'll be going around to different states, Trump said. I'll be working hard for people running for Congress and the people running for the Senate. We can pick up a lot of seats, especially if it keeps going the way it's going now.
On the same day he gave his non-apology to Cornyn, he also suggested that Donald Trump is fat: Take a look at this character that's running for president. . . . He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day.
In the United States, federal health officials confirmed a sixth case, which also marked the first time there was a person-to-person transmission of the virus in the United States.

Too many patients develop cancers that might have been prevented or found earlier if genetic testing had been performed, Walton Taylor, a Texas breast surgeon who is president of the group, told our colleague.
The president asked lawmakers to pass a measure prohibiting abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy based on the idea that a fetus can feel pain beyond that point of development. The House has passed such legislation in the past, but it's always been blocked by Democrats in the Senate.
CRUZ: Millions across this country. That is an astonishing statement. You know, Marco's Dad started as a bartender. My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs?
The mortality rate for Black babies is dramatically lower when they are delivered by Black doctors.
States could decide to instead get a flat amount from the feds to cover the Medicaid expansion population, regardless of year-to-year changes in enrollment or demand for services. States that choose this arrangement would also be newly allowed to cut benefits, such as by eliminating coverage of some prescription drugs or certain categories of preventive care. They could also impose new out-of-pocket costs on low-income enrollees.
We expect that we'll have a larger viewing audience for this live stream than we'd have if we'd run it on, say, CNN, Sanders told Dave. That's revolutionary. You can have this discussion even if the owners of the big media companies don't want to have it.
Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.
Early polls show the two candidates running about even — a measure of the force with which Perriello has disrupted Northam's plans. Yet most Virginians don't know much about either man and have yet to make up their minds, which makes Saturday's debate a crucial chance to define the race.
RUBIO: Well, Bret, what I've argued from the very beginning is ISIS -- in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces. This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow. It's how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.
The House opened an investigation into pandemic ventilator purchases overseen by the Trump White House.
Trump proposed a smorgasbord of policies in his 2019 budget aimed at tweaking prices downward. But Azar hinted the president may suggest bolder reforms in his speech next week, although he didn't provide specifics.
We are 21 strong, Senate Majority Whip William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin) said Thursday on a conference call organized by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. Republicans control 21 seats in the Senate, compared with 19 held by Democrats.
The gathering, which has been in the works for several months and was discussed at evangelist Billy Graham's funeral last month, will take place before the expected meeting of a separate group of evangelicals who advise, defend and praise Trump. Those leaders, which include members of Trump's informal advisory council, are considering convening at Trump International Hotel in Washington in June.
The party of the vice president, who acts as president of the Senate and breaks ties when they occur. That will be the Democratic Party after Biden is inaugurated as president and Kamala Harris becomes vice president. Her tie-breaking vote assures the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, will become majority leader. (The Senate technically has 48 Democrats and two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who reliably vote with them.)
This is a very potent threat, because the administration has the authority unilaterally to do this, and this is really a kill switch. This makes the program unprofitable for the majority of health plans operating in it today, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, a consulting firm. The timing of this threat is really curious, in the sense that now is the time that the plans have to be deciding whether to bid on 2018. If you're on the bubble and the president is making a threat like this . . . this just puts more uncertainty on the program.
OUCH: A Washington state man was diagnosed with the first confirmed case in the United States of the mysterious and potentially deadly coronavirus that broke out last month in China. The man was diagnosed after returning to the United States after a trip to the region around the Chinese city of Wuhan and is now in stable condition at a hospital in Everett, Wash., our Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Lenny Bernstein report.
It was their highest performance in an off-year election since 1928, Davis said. The 2013 shutdown had no effect at all.
According to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, the administration is in close contact with the House and Senate as the chambers draft pandemic relief legislation. The official said the ACA subsidies in the Ways and Means plan are consistent with ideas Biden laid out in what the White House calls the American Rescue Plan he has proposed.
But there is plenty else for the White House not to like about the book by Wolff, a longtime journalist who has written for Vanity Fair, the Guardian, the Hollywood Reporter and other publications.
Read the full report from our colleagues here:
In this case, Kneedler noted, the same Congress that in 2017 reduced to zero the penalty for not securing insurance simultaneously left in place the remainder of the ACA.
Murdoch reportedly suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas might be hard to square with his immigration promises. But Trump seemed unconcerned, Wolff writes, assuring Murdoch, We'll figure it out.
The House subcommittee on economic and consumer policy is investigating a government deal to buy $70 million worth of ventilators in the wake of a Post investigation that found that the devices were inadequate for treating most covid-19 patients.
A similar pivot has been playing out in Congress, where some Democrats have been calling for new limits on funding for migrant detention and immigration enforcement, despite the substantial increase in recent months in the number of migrants detained at the border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has taken to mocking Democrats for developing an allergy to border security.
President Trump attacked the Affordable Care Act as horrible, no-good, and said the Republicans would come up with a plan that is far better. (Reuters)
Meanwhile, one flight up, the admission line for Tillerson's hearing stretched out the door and around the corner, with Capitol employees acting as ushers for people seeking available seats. As committee members questioned the former ExxonMobil chief executive about his potential conflicts of interest and his ties to Russia, the entrance door opened and a chorus of voices could be heard chanting: Reject Rex! Reject Rex!
But Pelosi glossed over the nuances of this issue in her claim, so we dug into it.
Trump has shown a willingness to prod and cajole congressional leaders into action, and Tiberi said the White House would only get more willing over the coming weeks to intervene in intraparty squabbles.
Those who know McElvain described him as an expert lawyer and a well-liked boss. This is the first I'm hearing it, and it's a gut punch, said one person who worked with McElvain for years. That will be a very big blow to the morale of the [agency's] civil division, a really sad day for the Department of Justice and a loss for the country.
Though [Judge Leslie Southwick] called the House's argument questionable, he said a ruling on whether the House has a right under federal law to intervene in the case is unnecessary, Lydia and Jessie write.
Separately, the leaders included language that aims to mollify Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has questioned the bill's impact on people in her state who gained insurance under the ACA's expansion of Medicaid. The public insurance program traditionally covers low-income, elderly and disabled Americans along with children and pregnant women. Under the 2010 law, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid to include able-bodied adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, leading to the coverage of an additional 11 million people.
Extend full-premium subsidies to those receiving unemployment benefits who buy a plan on HealthCare.gov or the state marketplaces.
As we've reported, the new administration is likely to crack down on short-term plans that can offer skimpy benefits and tighten up rules around the insurance products that are sold on HealthCare.gov and the state-run exchanges. Officials will also be looking at ways to walk back what amount to permission slips the previous administration gave states to enact new requirements for Medicaid enrollment.

A plane carrying as many as 240 American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan landed overnight in the United States. David reports: The U.S. government chartered the aircraft to retrieve American diplomats and others from the central Chinese city that is at the heart of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The plane made a refueling stop in Alaska, where the passengers [will] undergo health screening, and would then head for southern California, the Associated Press reported. The aircraft is expected to land at March Air Reserve Base in California's Riverside County, instead of at Ontario International Airport as originally planned.
Hallam agreed. First we kick off all the MAGA hats, and then we'll talk about what's next, she said.
The basic narrative that Chinese journalism is dead was accepted as fact before this outbreak, Yuan Zeng, who studies media in China at the University of Leeds, told Gerry. But it's been surprising to see the space allowed for this wave of investigative reporting.
— OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma filed a motion to try to throw out a lawsuit from Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. In the motion, Purdue says the suit amounts to oversimplified scapegoating, which creates a sensationalist and distorted narrative that ignores facts, our Post colleague Katie Zezima reports.
Before Mosaic, finding information on computer data bases scattered around the world required knowing — and accurately typing — arcane addresses and commands like 'Telnet 192.100.81.100,'  reporter John Markoff wrote. Mosaic lets computer users simply click a mouse on words or images on their computer screens to summon text, sound and images from many of the hundreds of data bases on the Internet that have been configured to work with Mosaic.
When the Republican National Committee met in California last week, Trump appeared via a taped message in which he suggested he would like to be heavily involved ahead of next year's vote.
TRUMP: I'm changing. I'm changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can't do it, we'll get them in. But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.
The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20, 2017, safety will be restored. On that day, Trump says, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. (See above.)
But! This is Congress we're talking about, and crafty lawmakers quickly wielded this budgetary tool to sneak in totally unrelated budget items and avoid a Senate filibuster. In the '80s, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) advocated for a rule to prevent anything that doesn't directly change the level of spending or revenue — or where the changes are merely incidental to the policy — from being passed under reconciliation.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: I am one pooped puppy, Murkowski said last night after Schiff's speech. She added that she was too tired to discuss the substance of the Democratic presentation right then. She said she might go home to draw a bath and enjoy a glass of wine. (Kane)
WARREN: And he rounds the corner, and I remember standing there watching, and he comes around that corner. No fuss, no muss, waiting for his name again.
Public health experts have continued to point fingers at the pockets of unvaccinated children in the country, in part a result of an anti-vaccination movement that has spread because of misinformation.
The Chinese government said Tuesday that there had been 508 new confirmed cases by the end of the previous day, along with 74 deaths, bringing the total number of accumulated infections nationwide to 77,658, with 2,663 deaths, Adam Taylor and Wang Yuan report. A Chinese official suggested Monday evening that the country needs at least 28 days without new cases to show the virus is not spreading. … The remarks drew thousands of comments on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, where many wondered how long they would have to wait before normal life resumed. 'Two months will have 60% of enterprises killed!' one user wrote.
As the House shaped its bill in the spring, Cotton urged caution in the pace at which it was proceeding, but he did not advocate restraint in shredding some directives in the ACA. In effect, it was a simultaneous nod to conservatives on policy and centrists on timing.
As we get into the end of the year, and you start seeing what is happening as people are seeing their tax cuts realized when they start paying on an annualized basis for their tax cuts, going into next year, I think you're going to see the so-called deficit, Tenney said. I think you're going to see in the end, the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves, as predicted even by some of the government measures.
Thank you for making history, I think, on our side, Chairman Graham said, welcoming both to the panel.
Moderators Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace introduced the candidates and the debate began.
But under intense questioning from Democrats, Price outlined how his department could make insurance plans cheaper by scaling back several federal mandates, including what the ACA currently defines as essential benefits in coverage. And he refused to say whether the administration will keep providing cost-sharing subsidies for insurers participating in the federal marketplace. The multibillion-dollar infusion is critical to maintaining the system's stability, insurers say.
Q. You say your wife is unsatisfied with her sex life, Mr. Falwell? (Duncan Stevens)
I will commit to providing as much information as I can consistent with the regulations … that would be my intent, he said, noting he couldn't give specifics as he didn't know what kind of report is being prepared, I have no idea, and I have no idea what [deputy attorney general] Rosenstein has discussed with him.
Slavitt said when Congress eventually takes another stab at overhauling health care -- perhaps in the next decade -- his new group wants to be instrumental in spelling out the goals that the public could get on board with. People around health care are concerned that if we wait for Washington to fix things, we're point to end up with either a solution that is only backed by one party or we'll remain in a volatile situation, Slavitt told the Star Tribune.
The first electronic graphics generator for TV broadcasts was developed by Systems Resource Corp. in the mid-1960s, drawing upon the technology used for, as it happens, the arrivals and departures boards at airports, according to a company history. It was adapted by CBS Laboratories and first used by the network to identify speakers during the tumultuous 1968 political conventions.
As McConnell reflected on his interactions with Trump in his office suite on the second floor of the Capitol, he conceded that he has utterly failed to change Trump's penchant for picking fights on Twitter.
I said, 'Mr. president, right now, I couldn't do it,' Barr said. He said Trump asked for his phone number, and he did not hear from him again — until Trump was interested in selecting him as attorney general.
BAIER: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned.
Franklin Roosevelt's fireside chats let him speak directly, and unquestioned, to Americans. George W. Bush detailed his fitness routine in a 2002 column in Runner's World. More recently, Obama was known to keep the national press corps at a distance while he enlisted local TV stations with unpredictable and sometimes illuminating results.
The two Republican-appointed judges on the panel — Kurt D. Engelhard and Jennifer Walker Elrod — said that because Americans are free to ignore the insurance requirement with no risk of penalty, the attributes that saved the statute because it could be read as a tax no longer exist.
Pat Myers: You rang? This had better be good — I'm busy rejecting Style Invitational entries. (Bill Dorner, Indianapolis)
On the FBI paperwork, by the end of this week we will only have five nominees left to clear the FBI review and as a reminder, the timing's out of our hands when we hand stuff to OGE and FBI to clear the paperwork. But we're working with both agencies in an expeditious manner.
As for Buttigieg, he made the case he is the way to unify the party. It's time to galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people around bold ideas and actually get things done. He defended Biden when the moderators asked about Hunter Biden. This is about abuse of power. We've got to draw a line here. Asked about Soleimani, he gave a detailed, thoughtful explanation, clearing the commander-in-chief bar. People in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them, he said. What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep U.S. politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm's way if there is an alternative.
Renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. (The deal was renegotiated as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.)
President Biden's team has made clear that, given the crisis the country is in, they do not have the luxury of patience when it comes to passing some version of his $1.9 trillion covid-19 rescue plan.
OPERATOR: Thank you. And we'll go next to Matthew Cuddy from CNBC.
As my former colleague Hunter Schwarz wrote in April last year, David Letterman once made a list of the top 10 people Pence looks like:
The letter was a full-on attack on Boylan's credibility, suggesting that her accusation was premeditated and politically motivated. It disclosed personnel complaints filed against her and attempted to link her to supporters of Trump … Cuomo was involved in creating the letter.
The president did succeed in negotiating an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement, though its ratification is in doubt after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the deal needs to be reworked. Trump has also threatened to blow up part of the agreement by adding new car tariffs if Mexico does not prevent Central American migrants from coming to the United States.
An NRA magazine placed a photo of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Arizona lawmaker Gabby Giffords, who was shot, next to the words target practice, sparking outrage online, with some claiming the magazine was calling for an attack against the two Democrats:
But Krugman's real superpower may be his longevity. He began contributing to the Times in 2000, and he has chronicled numerous economic policies and proposals that have been promoted or propped up by zombie claims. He opens his book with a chapter on the push to privatize Social Security — by turning it over to financial services companies — with a series of columns showing that, contrary to Bush administration reports, the program is highly functional. He proceeds to dismantle other corporate and conservative talking points in vogue over the years: The Trump tax cut will pay for itself! (In fact, federal tax receipts on corporate income have plunged, and the budget deficit is now more than $1 trillion.) Government needs to be more fiscally responsible! (See aforementioned tax cut, which didn't come with concomitant spending cuts.) A disciple of John Maynard Keynes, Krugman eviscerates lawmakers in the United States for wringing their hands, post-financial crisis, over budget deficits caused by stimulus spending, which actually keep an economy from ruinous contraction. Without, say, unemployment benefits, families cut their spending, which in turn hurts vendors of goods and services.
Chaffetz faced angry crowds at a town hall meeting last night, and there was one particular exchange that went viral. A schoolteacher stood up and demanded to know: Where is your line in the sand? Chaffetz tried arguing that Trump is legally exempt from conflicts of interest, which is just misdirection, but if more conflicts and corruption emerge, this posture may not be sustainable forever. Democrats are largely powerless in Washington, but one thing they can do is keep pressuring Republicans to hold Trump accountable — they can keep asking that schoolteacher's question. People are very politically engaged right now, and they will be watching the GOP Congress closely.
As a candidate, Trump leapfrogged his opponents by running an anti-establishment outsider campaign. He pitched a populist infrastructure bill, tax code overhaul and a border wall — all of which have been held up by a push for a health-care bill that is more closely associated with long-standing Washington Republican dogma and that critics say fails to address Trump's promise of making health care less expensive and more widely accessible.
If you want to narrowly define the problem to vaccines, the GOP may be underselling its talking point. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), only about $17 billion, or less than 1 percent, is devoted to vaccine-related activities and programs.
In his Christmas message, Pope Francis urged leaders to prioritize making the coronavirus vaccine available to all and put first the most vulnerable. (Reuters)
In an interview on Good Morning America, in which he floated the idea of running for president, Trump first raises questions about President Barack Obama's citizenship.
Four Novembers later, after winning the electoral college 306 to 232, he changed his tune:
Bush Derangement Syndrome, the late columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in The Post, in 2003, could be understood as: The acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency — nay — the very existence of George W. Bush.
Trump has approached the coronavirus crisis as the perfect occasion to ramp up his push to consolidate power and curb oversight, said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Since its founding in the 1970s, Heritage has been one of the preeminent purveyors of conservative ideas in Washington. The think tank's annual budget of more than $80 million is equal to those of the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute combined.
First, it's difficult to simply compare average health insurance premiums in the individual market before and after the ACA because the law eliminated insurance plans with low costs but few benefits — what the Congressional Budget Office says barely qualifies as insurance. One study found that, when adjusting for actuarial value to create an apples-to-apples comparison, individual-market premiums actually dropped after the introduction of the ACA.
The higher figure is another reflection of how the pandemic continues to constrain the labor market. The United States gained back a paltry 49,000 jobs in January. In December, the country lost 227,000 jobs, our colleague reports.
It's heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off, said Castro. It should spur us to action.
TRUMP: Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems. We have so many problems that we have to solve.
Here are the facts, as laid out by House impeachment managers: Since the spring of 2020, then-President Trump warned that Democrats would try to steal the election. After President Biden won, Trump continued to contest the election, vowing, in video clips played for jurors, to never surrender in his fight against the election outcome. He told his supporters to fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. And when his supporters showed up to fight at the Capitol, many of them shouted that Trump had sent them.
He adds: Gottlieb indicated the FDA may take action if it determines a company is deliberately misleading the public about the safety of biologic copies, by issuing warning letters to the drugmakers involved.
In today's climate, they write, members rarely face direct consequences for refusal to cooperate, and sometimes face direct consequences for being seen as turncoats.
That means not just Spanish-language media, like Telemundo or Univision, but a Jill Biden interview with Parents Magazine, or a special virtual briefing with 20 African American outlets from across the country with the National Newspaper Publishers Association.
Violence against women — that's a national issue! an attendee shouted. That is an issue that impacts everyone, everywhere — not only in this country but everywhere.
Now, this does not mean that Trump won't shaft lower-income people — including many in his base — at the end of the day. He very well may go along with the GOP's downsizing of Medicaid. Beyond that, Trump and Republicans will pursue budgeting that deeply cuts taxes on the rich, which will likely require large cuts of some kind to government programs.
Andrew Yang: Well, one could argue that right now we have a lot of complication without a lot of the positive value you'd hope to generate from that complication.
The final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.
I am concerned by our singling out China for travel bans we are effectively penalizing it for reporting cases, Nuzzo told lawmakers. This may diminish its willingness to further share data and chill other nations' willingness to be transparent about their own outbreaks.
At 70, Trump became the oldest president ever sworn into office for the first time and one of the wealthiest in history. His far-reaching business holdings, which he said he has placed in a trust to be administered by his two adult sons, have prompted questions about how he will separate his personal financial interests from those of the country.
Watch Trump get a pair of Aflac socks and praise his wife's 2005 commercial for the insurance company:
José Díaz-Balart of Telemundo asked Castro about immigration and border security, prompting him to underscore a sweeping immigration plan he released earlier this year — and offer an emotional reaction to the photo.
The 2017 repeal-and-replace effort already demonstrated how hard it is for lawmakers to significantly revise or create new government programs using budget reconciliation. Democrats would be subject to the same tricky maze of rules, complicating things if they try to go big.
-- The Trumps and the Kushners are parting ways on two planned hotel collaborations in New Jersey after the partnership raised eyebrows — and a spate of new concerns — among ethics officials. The New York Times's Ben Protess and Steve Eder report: Kushner Companies and the Trump Organization recently dropped plans for the Trumps to manage an oceanfront hotel that the Kushners are building at the Jersey Shore. The companies also terminated an arrangement that had the Trumps managing a hotel outside New York City … Ethics watchdogs had taken aim at [Trump and Mr. Kushner] for retaining stakes in their family businesses while the companies were financially entangled in New Jersey. The families' dealmaking, the watchdogs suggested, could have influenced Mr. Trump's judgment about Mr. Kushner's role in the administration. And Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization's outside ethics adviser, had also asked questions about the potential collaboration.
John McKager Mac Stipanovich, a longtime GOP campaign operative in Florida, said he fears numerous other Republican losses in his state and around the country if the party cannot deliver on promises to repeal Obamacare and cut taxes.
The committee previously declined to label the outbreak a PHEIC, which is a special designation reserved for serious crises.

The overwhelmed state mediation program highlights the widespread problem of surprise emergency medical bills, an issue that has sparked bipartisan outrage in Washington and Austin alike, Jay and Shannon write. They write the issue of surprise medical bills arises when insurers and health-care providers disagree on the price of a treatment, meaning patients are stuck with a bill to pay for costs insurers won't cover.
Ikea wants pregnant women to pee on their ad:
If I disagreed with them, he said.
The totals aren't abysmal, but they do indicate that the ACA's initial progress towards reducing the country's uninsured rate has stalled. And lawmakers on Capitol Hill appear as divided as ever on how to improve the marketplaces by making them more affordable for the consumers who shop there.
Stephen Colbert joked about Trump's proposal to add Brazil, a South American nation, to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization:
It is unclear how strongly conservatives will insist on the changes.
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
On the other side, elected officials who supported Sanders felt his time was up. Primary results and national polls showed that Sanders represented only about a third of the Democratic Party. Biden did not arouse the same opposition from blue-collar Democrats that Hillary Clinton did in 2016, which meant that Biden beat Sanders in many of the Midwestern counties the insurgent had won four years earlier.
Weinstein's lawyers are expected to appeal the conviction on the basis of several concerns, including the amount of media attention on the case and the fact that the three supporting accusers were permitted to testify even though charges were not brought on their behalf. The appeal must be filed after sentencing. … Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno told reporters, 'He took it like a man. He knows this is not over.'
There's no denying Gottlieb's a conservative who opposes government price controls – he most recently served as a fellow at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute – but he says the government needs to do a much better job of promoting competition among drug makers.
Well, if those issues aren't going to produce concrete legislative results, how else could Trump and Republicans earn voters' continued indulgence? In essence, Trump promised a better life for the down-and-out in the Rust Belt and the resentful anti-elitists everywhere. What will be the evidence of that? Unemployment presumably would need to go even lower, coal jobs would need to return, and productivity would have to spike, resulting in wage growth. Take-home pay would have to rise, at the very least. And accomplishing those end goals may be even more challenging than passing an Obamacare replacement.
Just before the winter holidays, Republicans in the Senate gave him a chance to save face by passing legislation to keep the government running through Feb. 8 to buy the White House and Democrats time to keep negotiating without the stress of a shutdown.
It is notable that Bannon made his declaration of deconstruction during a Q&A with Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union. Gorsuch, a political operator whose mom ran the EPA under Ronald Reagan, wrote an email to Schlapp right after the 2004 election. He had just volunteered to help George W. Bush in Ohio. What a magnificent result for the country, Gorsuch told Schlapp, who was Bush's political director. For me personally, the experience was invigorating and a great deal of fun. … While I've spent considerable time trying to help the cause on a volunteer basis in various roles, I concluded that I'd really like to be a full-time member of the team. Gorsuch sent Schlapp a list of jobs he'd be competent to handle. He wound up getting a plum appointment in the Justice Department, and then Bush appointed him to the 10th Circuit.
In the United States, however, some 58 percent of the non-elderly population received employer-paid health care in 2017, subsidized via $280 billion in federal tax breaks.

-- Howard Schultz laid out his vision for an independent presidential bid in a speech at Purdue University. Michael Scherer reports: He made clear that his exploration of a campaign was predicated on his fear that a 'far-left' Democratic 2020 nominee would deliver reelection to Trump by pushing away many voters in the middle of the political spectrum. At the same time, he promised to avoid forcing the same result by splitting the anti-Trump vote, a concern of many Democratic political strategists. … He described policies that would hue closely to his former party's consensus positions during Barack Obama's presidency, with a more rigorous focus on fiscal discipline.
Sanders is truly an authentic politician. That helps explain why some early national polls show him competitive in a head-to-head race against Trump. But at about this time in 1984, a Gallup poll had Mondale in a dead heat with Ronald Reagan. Eleven months later, after Mondale's agenda was fully litigated, Reagan won 59 percent to 41 percent.
Basically almost every single person running for the Republican nomination this time would support that position, Dan Holler, of the activist group Heritage Action for America, said on Wednesday.

You can judge a man by the enemies he makes. Preet is proud of his. In addition to Cuomo, Vladimir Putin also hates him: Mr. Bharara was among 18 United States officials barred from Russia in 2013 in retaliation to American sanctions imposed on Russians accused of rights violations.

The company expects to roll out the program later this year for insurance plans that work with Express Scripts and in 2020 for Cigna plans. Glen Stettin, chief innovation officer for Express Scripts, told me the company has struck agreements with the country's three insulin manufacturers — Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi — for discounts on the insulin so the insurance company won't have to eat all the costs.
But states still regulate insurance markets, so many states can and have decided not to allow these skinnier health plans to be sold, Rivlin said.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) stopped by Jimmy Kimmel's show:
TRUMP: You're going to see, you don't know...
-- The continuously unfolding scandals appear to have given a little breathing room to Northam as he weighs his options. Gregory S. Schneider, Dan Balz, Laura Vozzella and Paul Kane report: The crisis has left Democratic leaders stymied, deeply worried about long-term damage to the reputation of the state and the party but frozen by uncertainty about what fresh disclosures might come next. Party leaders have urged elected Democrats to stay off television, say as little as possible publicly and wait to try to regroup until the situation becomes clearer. … While they continue to call publicly for Northam to resign, most Democrats now want the governor to stay in office at least until there is clarity on the issues involving Fairfax and Herring.
-- Some Mexicans believe the Central American caravans might soon come to an end as the nation's authorities strengthen their anti-migrant operations at the Guatemalan border. From the AP: From the roadside stand where his family sells mole, barbecue and chicken stew, Miguel Ángel Vázquez has seen all the caravans of Central American migrants and asylum seekers stream past his front door in recent years… After watching armored National Guard troops and immigration agents break up the latest one right on his doorstep, loading men, women and wailing children onto buses and hauling them off to a detention center in the nearby city of Tapachula, he's sure of one thing. 'I can see that these caravans are no longer going to pass,' said Vásquez, 56.
We have lofty goals, Azar writes in the report. Winning these battles will require not just innovative use of the powers and resources of government, but also enlisting all other stakeholders, whose buy-in will be necessary to create sustained and significant improvements for the people we serve.

If anyone should grasp the collective-action problems facing single-payer, it's a senator from progressive Vermont, which failed to launch a statewide plan six years ago. Among other issues, Vermont's beloved family-owned roadside creemee stands, which sell maple-syrup-infused soft-serve ice cream in the summer, might have been bankrupted by a new payroll tax.
He's handling impeachment like a surgeon would — with precision, said Sparks, who said she will eagerly volunteer for both Trump's and McConnell's campaigns this fall. McConnell's been a good ally of the president, and Trump's coattails are very long.
For communities that have yet to come up with a plan to resume in-person instruction this school year, it is unlikely to make a difference. In many places, the major hurdle to reopening schools before fall — or even then — remains disagreement with employee unions over what level of local transmission of the coronavirus is safe for their return, The San Francisco Chronicle's Alexei Koseff reports.

Some allies see wisdom in Trump opting to campaign on the same issues he promised to fix in 2016, pointing to the large, enthusiastic crowds that the president continues to draw with his America First message.
How he handles this impeachment is going to be the big determinant of whether people get behind him, said Kevin Gordon, a talk radio host and activist.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Md.) and James Clyburn (S.C.) backed Young, who is the president's nominee to serve as OMB deputy director. If chosen and confirmed, Young would be the office's first Black female director.

AHH: The wave of new Democrats on Capitol Hill is using policy and social media to push the party to the left on divisive issues like health care and climate change ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Al Race, deputy director at the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, said a lack of coverage often leads to a lack of health care. Without it, health problems that might have been corrected can persist into adulthood.
Trump did not elaborate on his strategy to erase HIV. But Azar, the HHS secretary, said in an interview that the plan grew out of several months of work by a team of leaders. They include Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a pioneer in AIDS research, and Robert Redfield Jr., a longtime AIDS researcher in the military and in the University System of Maryland before he became director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March.
For example, the IRS sent 300,000 stimulus payments erroneously to accounts held by the bank MetaBank that no longer exists. These accounts are only used temporarily during tax season to receive refunds and figure out what fees go to the tax preparer and what amount goes back to the taxpayer. The bank sent the money back to the IRS, which is now likely to issue paper checks.
The meeting was unplanned, but Davidson seized the opportunity. He asked Pence about Trump's recent comments about Medicare and the Medicaid block grant announcement.
Biden appeared agitated yesterday, acknowledging his presidential campaign received a gut punch in the caucuses.
After the president disbanded the HIV/AIDS advisory council in late 2017, Azar announced in December the appointment of two new co-chairs, who are scheduled to start meeting next month and are the only members so far. HHS also is creating a hub of AIDS advisers.

-- India imposed retaliatory tariffs on American products — increasing levies on almonds, apples and some metal products. Annie Gowen reports: It is a $241 million measure that matches the amount of steel and aluminum import duty expected to be collected from India by the United States through the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration earlier this year. More than a third of the figure comes from almonds; India is the world's biggest buyer of U.S.-grown almonds. … Economists noted that the amount of money involved with India's levies dwarfed in comparison with that of China … but that the gesture had important symbolism and could presage further strain between the two friendly democracies at time when their diplomats are working to deepen military ties.

Earlier in the week, Trump traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans about the issue and spoke on the phone afterward with a handful of senators to urge them to help write a new law — a request that many consider unrealistic in a divided Congress and politically perilous ahead of next year's elections.
It's just death panels all over again, he said. They squawk … and they make up stuff out of thin air, just like they did on health care, and then we win. I believe, and I hope, it will be the same result on climate change.
We all know that President Trump had the power to stop these attacks. He was our commander in chief. He had the power to assess the security situation, send backup, send help. He also had incited this violent attack. They were listening to him. He could have commanded them to leave, Cicilline said. But he didn't.
El Salvador halved its murder rate, from 102.67 per 100,000 in 2015 to 50.28 per 100,000 last year. There were more than 72,000 apprehensions of Salvadorans trying to cross the U.S. border in 2016, but the number fell by more than half in 2018, to fewer than 32,000, as The Post's Kevin Sieff reported.
In a section about the opioid crisis, the agency points to new NIH-funded research into prevention and treatment of addiction and increased flexibility for several states in how they may use Medicaid funding to treat patients with substance abuse. It also stresses an increased emphasis on medication-assisted treatment and steps to make the overdose-reversing drug naloxone more widely available.

However, environmentalists and public health advocates have pushed to stop the sale of the chemical after it was reported to cause health problems in children.
For his part, Sanders is telegraphing a more conciliatory approach. Before his town hall on CNN, Sanders spoke last night at a dinner hosted by the South Carolina Democratic Party. Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Pete Buttigieg and Steyer also delivered remarks at the Charleston Marriott. The Sanders campaign distributed the prepared text of his speech in advance. The senator was slated to criticize the political establishment and some of my opponents. But Sanders tossed these comments and instead emphasized his own electability. I know you're hearing a lot on TV, 'Bernie can't win,' Sanders said. Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
The House Democrats' bill sets out a proposal to, among other things, reduce health-care premiums (capping out-of-pocket costs at 10 percent of income) and expanding tax credits for those beyond 400 percent of the federal poverty line ($104,000 for a family of four). Protect Our Care, a progressive group backing the legislation, explains, In all, the bill's extended tax credits, reinsurance programs and premium assistance would cut premiums for all ACA-compliant plans sold on the individual market, reducing premiums or deductibles for 13 million with individual market coverage and creating lower cost options for 12 million uninsured people eligible for coverage through the marketplace. The bill also reinstates the guarantee for those with preexisting conditions, disallows non-ACA compliant plans and reaffirms the list of essential health-care benefits to be covered by the ACA.
OUCH: As Sen. John McCain recovers from surgery for an intestinal infection and undergoes treatment for brain cancer, he has mostly been receiving a stream of well wishes and tributes for his long career in public service -- but not from Trump's staunch defenders, The Post's Eugene Scott writes.
-- Bloomberg News, Sinclair Employees Say Their Contracts Make It Too Expensive to Quit, by Jordyn Holman, Rebecca Greenfield and Gerry Smith: After Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. drew widespread criticism for having anchors read a statement taking aim at the integrity of other U.S. media outlets, many wondered why some of the company's journalists didn't just quit. The short answer is the cost may be too steep. According to copies of two employment contracts reviewed by Bloomberg, some Sinclair employees were subject to a liquidated damages clause for leaving before the term of their agreement was up: one that requires they pay as much as 40 percent of their annual compensation to the company.
More than four in five Democratic voters called for a taxpayer-funded health-care plan. Furthermore, 60 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats supported a plan in which Americans under 65 have the option of buying into Medicare. Overall, 65 percent of people surveyed said they back a public health insurance option that competes with private payers, Politico's Rachel Roubein writes.

Ordinarily, the federal Affordable Care Act marketplace is open during a limited period near the end of the year. The rest of the year, consumers can only sign up if they have a major change in life circumstance, such as a job change or the birth of a child.
During the hard-fought 2008 primary battles between her mother and Barack Obama, Chelsea was rarely seen in the early struggle — much to the frustration of campaign aides and the disappointment of the media. When she showed up on stage with her mother, she barely spoke. I'm just hanging out with my mom today, she would say.
TRUMP: Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq. I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that. Nuclear weapons change the game.
Additionally, immigration now tops the list of issues that voters say they most want to hear candidates talking about — a testament to the power of the presidential bully pulpit. Asked as an open-ended question, 19 percent of voters said they want to hear about immigration and 13 percent said they want to hear about health care. A similar share of Republicans (21 percent) picked immigration as Democrats (18 percent).
But as the Obama era wound down and the Trump era ramped up, the pejorative characterization lost something. Maybe the absence of a black president took some of the sting out of it; maybe it couldn't be squared with President-elect Donald Trump's promise to take care of everybody when it came to health care or his repeated promises to bring American jobs back from overseas, rather than take the approach that his Republican predecessors did — encouraging Americans to compete.

John Salciccioli, director of actuarial services for commercial business at Independent Health, a nonprofit, New York-based insurer, said that his plan is looking hard at the possibility that the individual mandate goes away.

One of the first bills he sponsored would have allowed the official presentation of the U.S. flag to families of federal civilian employees killed in the line of duty. To his surprise, the American Legion opposed the measure because of its appearance of equating civilian and military service.
The audio of Bloomberg's 2015 speech in which he defends targeting minorities for police stops will make it hard to woo black voters. What Bloomberg said was not a defense of stop-and-frisk; it was a defense of racial profiling. Big difference. Under stop-and-frisk, police needed to have a reasonable suspicion that the individual they were stopping and frisking had a weapon, but Bloomberg said male, minorities, 15 to 25 was enough for reasonable suspicion. You can just take [that] description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops, he said. That is racial profiling, plain and simple. Add to that Bloomberg's comments that getting rid of redlining — a discriminatory housing practice that denied mortgages to residents of poor, minority neighborhoods — was to blame for the 2008 financial crisis, and it's hard to see how he can generate the Obama-level African American turnout Democrats need to win.
Aides stress that the GOP plan is likely to undergo more changes to garner the 50 votes Republicans need to pass it. Moderate senators are concerned about cutting off coverage too quickly for those who gained it under the ACA, also known as Obamacare, while conservatives don't want to leave big parts of the ACA in place.
For others, it's easier to dwell on those who support Ryan's ideas.

Early in 2017 Trump also attacked members of the House Freedom Caucus for being insufficiently pliant as he sought to repeal Obamacare. In a closed-door meeting, he threatened then-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) with a primary should he not comply with the president's wishes. Later, he attacked the caucus — embodied by Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) — on Twitter, suggesting that he might try to oust them. That anger faded: Meadows is now Trump's chief of staff, and Jordan is poised to receive the Medal of Freedom.
ACA subsidies are likely to increase under coronavirus relief plans.

The court's four liberals appeared convinced that the Louisiana law at issue, requiring admitting privileges at nearby hospitals for abortion-clinic doctors, is identical to one from Texas that the Supreme Court struck down four years ago. That appeared to leave Roberts, now at the court's ideological center, holding the deciding vote, Barnes and Ann Marimow report. As the case was argued, he asked a variation of the same question to all three lawyers addressing the justices: Should the court undertake a fact-dependent, state-by-state analysis when reviewing such restrictions? That could indicate he felt he could distinguish Louisiana's law from the Texas statute. Or it could mean he agreed with challengers that similar laws were doomed because of the court's precedent from 2016. Roberts, a dissenter in the Texas case, did not indicate what he believed was the proper answer. … Among Wednesday's spectators was Roberts's wife, Jane Roberts, who before the chief justice joined the court was legal counsel for Feminists for Life of America, a group that opposes abortion.
Key excerpt: The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father's office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero, said an astonished and derisive [Stephen K.] Bannon, not long after the meeting was revealed. The three senior guys in the campaign, an incredulous Bannon went on, thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the twenty-fifth floor — with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s--t, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.
The big question is whether the Supreme Court will take up any of these cases, with its new conservative majority. So far, the justices haven't seemed eager to revisit the court's abortion doctrine.
I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we're totally prepared.
Democratic members of Congress have coalesced around the FAMILY Act, which would provide up to 12 weeks paid leave not just to care for a new child, but also to recuperate from a serious illness or care for a family member. It's more generous than what Republicans have proposed, but it would also require more employee and employer payroll tax contributions.
The guidelines marked the first time a national health organization has recommended anything to fend off the most common complication of pregnancy, and they amounted to a public call for health providers to seek out at-risk women and guide them to treatment, Pam writes.
Every 2020 candidate is talking extensively about climate change in his or her stump speech, but no one else has made it the central rationale for seeking the presidency.

It's all going to be degraded if we don't take this battle on.

But building support will take more than schmoozing. Needham argued that the White House and congressional leadership asked Republicans to make a politically impossible decision on health care — casting a vote in support of a bill that had a 17 percent public approval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.
We also see the effects of political dysfunction in the inability of Congress to come anywhere near balancing the federal budget, even when the economy is seemingly operating at capacity.
The bill, passed 235 to 192 with nearly all Republicans opposing it, authorized the House general counsel to intervene in a controversial lawsuit against the ACA brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, which could result in the entire ACA being eliminated if a Texas judge's decision is ultimately upheld in higher courts. Democrats leveraged the bill to cast themselves as the protectors of Americans with serious health concerns while pushing Republicans into a tight political corner (only three of them backed the measure).
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) represents San Francisco and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer is from New York. So it's no mystery why their cities and states are being name-checked here. The GOP is referring to two provisions.
Why is the drug so pricey? Carolyn explains the high costs of gene therapies are a result of their one-time use, as the treatment replaces or restores faulty genes rather than treating symptoms. Instead of addressing symptoms, they replace or restore the malfunctioning gene at the root of disease, she writes. The hope is that such treatments could be cures, but at the moment, no one knows exactly how long Luxturna's effects — which do not fully restore vision — will last. Clinical data shows that the drug works at up to four years in some patients, and there is anecdotal evidence that the effects could last longer.

John Gurda, a Milwaukee historian, fact-checked Jefferson's claim. And yes, he said in an interview, that's mostly true — especially when it comes to socialists in the mayor's office. Milwaukee has had three, more than any other major American city. But, Gurda said, today's Republican Party and Milwaukee's ex-mayors probably would have a very different definition of socialism, according to Reis.
Instead of quizzing, say, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on how she is going to pay for Medicare-for-all, it would be far more productive to examine her record for how, if at all, she compromised to achieve aims; the degree to which she has favored regulation of sectors of the economy and in what circumstances; and — this is critical — why she thinks Obamacare cannot be fixed. I'd like to hear answers to those questions, as well as:
But Pelosi's staff says it's not so definitive. The replacement bill strikes language in current law that applies to the veteran tax credit with no mandate to reissue the existing IRS regulation, so that means the Treasury Department and IRS need to come up with new regulations to add the protection for veterans, they said.

Kevin Sieff reports: Figures for apprehensions, a widely used barometer for unauthorized traffic, nearly tripled from March through May compared with the same three months in 2017 . . . There are a variety of reasons for the surge. But for many migrants crossing the border … their attempts are based on close analyses of Trump's policies. The president who promised a wall, who pledged to make their lives in America impossible, has not managed to shut down the vast smuggling networks that funnel people across the border.

Metzl's book focuses on health care in Tennessee, gun rights in Missouri and budget cuts in Kansas. With each example, he shows how white identity played a role in the tragedy that befell each state. In Tennessee, Metzl estimates in his book that between 2011 and 2015, as many as 12,000 white lives might have been saved had Tennessee expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.

Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.

Barr did not seem to comprehend the joke at first, saying, Excuse me? Then it seemed to dawn on him.
Robert Mueller was a God-like figure to the Democrats, until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30,000,000 Mueller Report. (April 2 tweet)
Unlike Price, Azar already has several years at HHS under his belt, where he worked before moving to major drug manufacturer Eli Lilly. He also has a law degree and is described by former colleagues as someone who is less political and more pragmatic in his approach.
The inquiry opens a new front in the scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, one of the few lenders willing to do business with Donald J. Trump in recent years. The bank is already the subject of two congressional investigations and was examined last year by New York banking regulators, who took no action, they report.
The first (and so far, only) spot from the original pro-Trump PAC is more granular, but also more generic, than it is successful. A message about the president delivering on his promises is matched with an image of Trump in front of a Boeing jet. The voice-over intones, Mainstream media won't tell you this: One month in, President Trump is making America great again.
Though the GOP proposal leaves out details — such as which specific deductions would be eliminated and how much the plan would cost — it offers a fuller alternative to the deep rate cuts pitched by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

THE SILENCE OF THE (Lam) BS: We may not get it by Jan. 20, but at least it won't be coming from the Oval Office. (William Kennard, Arlington, Va.)
OOF: As the nation grapples with the ongoing opioid crisis, crystal meth has crept back too. The New York Times's Frances Robles reports methamphetamine has never been purer, cheaper or more lethal. Nationwide, about 6,000 people died from the use of stimulants, mostly meth, in 2015. That's a 255 percent increase from a decade prior, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This system is far from perfect, which means that many middle-class and upper-middle-class people supplement it with private health insurance (so that, for example, that they do not have to wait long times for some surgical procedures). Even so, it's socialized medicine on a scale which would be politically unthinkable in America. Ireland also has welfare benefits for the unemployed that are not notably generous by European standards, but are wildly permissive in comparison to their U.S. equivalents.
His comments come as Trump is urging Republicans to be the party of healthcare and produce a replacement for the Affordable Care Act in advance of the 2020 elections.
The number and proportion of Americans without health insurance grew in 2018 for the first time in a decade, according to the most recent census figures. The figures showed that the uninsured rate increased to 8.5 percent from 7.9 percent the year before. More than 27.5 million U.S. residents lack coverage.
The district — which Saccone himself had called Trump country — had been the sort of place where Democrats struggled to compete. While registered Democrats slightly outnumbered registered Republicans, many of those Democrats bolted from their national party during Obama's presidency.
The House Veterans Affairs Committee holds a hearing on the Veterans Affairs budget request for 2020.
As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism. We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet. And then, when I am commander-in-chief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant.
— The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Federal Employee Program announced it would donate $1 million to help federal employees who went unpaid during the shutdown. In addition, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the company serving the Washington area, is pledging $1 million to the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund and $500,000 in donations to regional food banks and human service organizations. The donations are meant to offer cash grants and no-interest loans to help workers who were furloughed.
— Anti-tobacco advocates pushed members of the D.C. Council during a five-hour hearing last week to add menthol cigarettes to its list of barred products.
Elsewhere on the call, McCarthy offered a selective account of the 2017 health-care battles on Capitol Hill, where Republicans in the House toiled for months to craft an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, narrowly passing a bill in May before watching the Senate abandon the effort three months later.
Even though the Koch network pointedly refused to endorse Trump's White House bid in 2016, his campaign ended up adopting major CVA policy priorities. One key ally of the group was former GOP congressman Jeff Miller of Florida, a Trump campaign adviser who served as chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Miller did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump repeated this claim on March 13.
Along with the food stamp program, which the Agriculture Department announced would continue to be funded through February, Secretary Sonny Perdue said that other programs -- including school meals and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) -- would also be funded through next month. WIC provides food, baby formula and breast-feeding support to more than 7 million mothers and children under 5 years old, our colleagues write.
(Lindsey Bever) A retired Howard University professor is pushing the NBA and schools across the country to play a song widely known as the Black National Anthem at games during Black History Month.

What we said in our announcement yesterday is we have the ability to monitor and surveil what's going on and what the patterns of use are and we've made it clear that if kids migrate to menthol then we will have to revisit this, he said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children younger than 6 receive numerous vaccinations, including for hepatitis A and B, diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, chickenpox, and measles, mumps, and rubella.
This is the reason we so rarely see any entitlement reforms. Americans have come to rely on Medicare and Social Security and the specific benefits they have been afforded, and any political discussion about rolling back those benefits — even for future beneficiaries — is usually a nonstarter. Look back at George W. Bush and the GOP's aborted effort to privatize Social Security last decade, which Democrats used as a cudgel for years afterward. Likewise, Republicans attacked Democrats for Obamacare cutting $500 billion from future Medicare spending.
-- Some Republicans are beginning to talk publicly about canceling the August congressional recess so that they can get a bill done. The Hill: A Senate GOP aide expressed doubt, however, that David Perdue, Dan Sullivan and Steve Daines will get very far in convincing McConnell to cancel the recess.
The increase in the price of insulin has been responsible for driving average price increases for all injectable brand-name drugs, they write in a letter to companies. It is clear these steep price increases are resulting in patients lacking access to the life-saving medications they need.
This presents an extraordinary opportunity for Biden and congressional Democrats if they can see their way clear to take advantage of it.
Fair called Nomani's appeal to her employer a very dangerous trend. She said Nomani, a former professor at Georgetown, has no standing at the university to complain.
He might be an okay guy, like, just hang out with on the street, she said. But to run the country? No.
In the interview, Mnuchin strongly disputed that he had allowed key vacancies in the Treasury Department, pointing to a long list of officials in top positions and saying Congress should move faster to confirm his appointees. Treasury has two deputy chiefs of staff.
— Health care is one of several issues Trump vowed in 2016 to fix that he wants to revive ahead of the 2020 election. But the real issue is whether the president can win a second term on issues he promised he would resolve in the first term, as our colleagues Ashley Parker and Toluse Olorunnipa write.
The Supreme Court ruled that states may require online retailers to collect billions of dollars of sales tax revenue owed to them. The justices sided 5-4 with the Trump administration and more than 40 states asking the court to overturn a 1992 decision restricting such collection. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that dramatic technological changes had rendered their previous ruling obsolete and unfairly damaged traditional stores.

(Ann Marimow) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, was charged with fraud and breach of public trust. The charges stem from her alleged use of outside caterers in their official residence — who reportedly prepared meals worth a total of $99,000.

-- Today marks 50 years since the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. The Post's front page on April 5, 1968: Dr. King Is Slain in Memphis. From The Post's report: The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed by a sniper today when he strolled alone onto the balcony of his hotel. Gov. Buford Ellington ordered 4,000 National Guard troops into the city and a curfew was imposed. Unrest immediately broke out in the Negro district.
After a comprehensive and independent review of the entire Heritage organization, the board determined there were significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation, Saunders said. While the organization has seen many successes, Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems.
Dr. Ben Carson (inaudible) lifted himself out of poverty and is an inspiring choice. He will help the Trump administration deliver on its promise to implement a plan to (inaudible) as outlined on the 26th of October.
But more common was the gloomy outlook of the longtime Washington lobbyist who said of his executive-suite clients, They don't see anyone on the horizon in either party who can drain this swamp.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Trump declared that he was close to releasing a plan that would create insurance for everybody. That was well ahead of the actual Republican pace of unveiling proposals; it also sounded rhetorically close to former president Barack Obama's goal of universal health care.
This practice isn't found in other developed countries, where patients' out-of-pocket costs tend to be more fixed and much lower, Kaltenboeck told me.
The Daily Signal's inclusion in the pool could set a precedent for other advocacy organizations, such as the liberal Center for American Progress, that have expanded into newsgathering. These groups could argue that they, too, qualify for White House press credentials and pool shifts. The slope could become even more slippery if extremist or racist organizations sought similar status.
Democrats running for president have proposed Medicare-for-all, essentially a single-payer plan, or making Medicare (a government plan for people over 65) available to people younger than retirement age. The version proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would eliminate private insurance and offer insurance instead through the federal government.
Retired senator Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), who worked closely with Ryan during a massive but ultimately failed 2010 effort to reduce the deficit, described the Wisconsin lawmaker as a wonderful guy, and he's a very sensitive, special man. He said Ryan's Republican colleagues never rallied to his side when it came time to take tough votes on addressing the government's most costly programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
The scientists plan to revisit the earliest coronavirus cases, attempting to reconstruct after more than a year early cases of the virus, as well as what went in and out of the Huanan Seafood Market in November and December 2019.
And from Job Creators Network, a conservative advocacy group that opposes Obamacare: This decision to look at the ACA in the normal time frame provides the time and opportunity for legislators on the left and right to look at new solutions to the healthcare problem. JCN's extensive research has shown the American public is hungry for a system that gives them choice and allows them to have a relationship with their doctor.
Here's a quick assessment of some of Trump's most significant promises. The full list can be seen on the Trump Promise Tracker landing page.
— And here are a few more good reads:
We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
Cutting the nation's rising drug costs is a bipartisan goal, and for a time Democrats shared President Trump's campaign vision for cracking down on pharmaceutical companies and giving the government more power to negotiate deals. But Trump has walked back some of those positions, and at a Senate hearing Tuesday morning, the Democrats on the panel let Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar know they were not impressed with the White House plan.
The state can continue its lawsuit against two other defendants, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. The lawsuit contends that the three companies are partly responsible for the thousands of opioid deaths there. Purdue and others face similar claims in several other courts, and the first major settlement in the flood of lawsuits could help set the bar for compensation sought by hundreds of states, cities, counties and Native American tribes for the costs incurred in responding to the epidemic, Lenny and Katie write.
-- The State Department condemned Russia's handling of the protesters on Sunday, calling it an affront to core democratic values: The United States strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia on Sunday, said spokesman Mark Toner. Detaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values. We were troubled to hear of the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny … as well as the police raids on the anti-corruption organization he heads. The White House has not yet spoken out against the attacks. (Politico)
But conservative groups are already pressing Republican lawmakers to follow through on long-tendered promises to anti-abortion voters.
WALLACE: But wait one second. Specifically and quickly on the question, will you promise that you will -- and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?
Tim Lacey, a 69-year-old registered Democrat, said Saccone's support for Trump overcame any loyalty to the Republican, his fellow church member and a former customer of his construction business.
Yet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given Beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the Trump administration, our colleagues write. So has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with China after years of tariff battles.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is keeping up her impeachment drumbeat:
None of these votes are materially disrupting the Democratic agenda. Instead, they're putting some swing-district Democrats, like Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), on record, repeatedly, against Pelosi. The speaker has not lost substantive Democratic support on must-pass bills; she has lost them on nonbinding language meant to embarrass Democrats.
CRUZ: Why don't you release the tapes? Release the tapes.
Two top congressional committees — House Oversight and Senate Finance — have scheduled simultaneous hearings Tuesday on the high cost of prescription drugs. Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have both vowed to make health-care costs a priority this year.
It's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. And, frankly, look, if I were president, I'd take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level.
Members discussed whether to institute per capita limits on how much money the government would put into the Medicaid system or to shift to a block grant where states receive a lump sum of money to distribute as they see fit.
John Oliver took a deep dive into the world of psychics:
-- A Trump appointee at the Pentagon resigned after reports showed he posted birther conspiracies about Obama. CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott report: Todd Johnson is a former Trump campaign state director in New Mexico who joined the Department of Defense in 2017 as an advance officer, a Pentagon employee with the sensitive task of providing logistical support related to the secretary's events and appearances domestically and abroad. … [A review] of his social media found that Johnson posted birther conspiracies about [Obama] and shared a video that claimed Obama was the Antichrist.
Still, Chelsea endured years engulfed in drama and the media scrutiny that surrounded her family. She has never uttered word about it — except to say it's none of your business — but it is hard to imagine that it hasn't profoundly shaped the woman she has become.
The issue being considered by the court stems from a 2017 decision by Congress to remove Obamacare's penalty for not buying insurance. A group of Republican-led states and the Trump administration argued that the elimination of the penalty made not only the mandate, but also the entire law, unconstitutional.
As a mother and as first lady, it concerns me that in today's fast-paced and ever-connected world, children can be less prepared to express or manage their emotions and oftentimes turn to forms of destructive or addictive behavior such as bullying, drug addiction or even suicide, she added.
-- D.C. is seeking to dismiss a legal challenge to city regulations requiring some child-care workers to get associate degrees. Hannah Natanson reports: Two day-care workers and a parent are suing the city over the controversial rules that supporters contend will make D.C. a national model for providing high-quality care for the youngest children.
So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
— Politico's Dan Diamond spoke with Chris Meekins, who left HHS last week after helping oversee migrant family reunifications. Meekins called the family separation policy headed by the Department of Homeland Security an ill-fated policy that was devised by Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. I think that it's unconscionable to do it in this way, Meekins said. Listen to the podcast here.
Some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. Others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. Still others say that Trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other GOP presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.
OUCH: Florida's vaccine rollout has become a free-for-all.
Here are some other changes we expect to see:
-- The bill was a flashpoint in the debates, as Ossoff argued that the legislation guts protections for preexisting conditions. He told the story of a 7-year-old boy who has a heart condition and might struggle to get insurance if the bill became law. We need to fix Obamacare, not repeal it, the former House staffer says in one of his ads.
This much is true: The FDA has wide latitude in whether to grant orphan drug status. And because the status applies to molecules rather than specific drugs, companies can obtain orphan drug status for newer versions of the same drug, if they show they've improved the drug in some meaningful way. Congress recently codified this approach in the 2017 FDA Reauthorization Act.
The most recent quality poll on earmarks, from CNN in 2010, showed that just 19 percent of Americans found earmarks generally acceptable, while 79 percent said they were generally unacceptable. It was even more pronounced in the GOP, which opposed earmarks 89 to 11. That's a pretty steep hill to climb.
Knox: Let me turn to foreign policy. Big news in U.S.-Russia relations with the Biden administration announcing sanctions against senior Russian officials for the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. At the end of the day, though, Vladimir Putin's in charge. What's the best way to get him to change course?
But the Jarrett story went viral on the right; on a Fox Business segment over the weekend, radio host Tammy Bruce cited it as an undercovered revelation that demonstrated the forces arrayed against Trump. In her Monday interview with Gowdy, Ingraham argued that a Watergate-level scandal was building — but at one point, she suggested, hopefully, that the president was not simply basing his rhetoric on what was in conservative media.
Coronavirus anxiety is everywhere, and there is no cure.
If I were a politician I would never go on cable TV without first getting an agreement that there would be no writing on the screen, says Greta Van Susteren, who has hosted programs on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC and now Voice of America. I would tell the network: 'You can ask me what you want, but no writing on the screen.' 
In a video taken Saturday at a meeting in the Richmond suburbs in his safely Republican district, Brat said, Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go.
On EHBs, the proposed rule says states won't have to choose from a limited fixed menu of benchmark plans to set their minimum coverage requirements. Instead, they'd be able to select a la carte. For example, Ohio could choose the ambulatory care standards from one benchmark plan and the preventive services from another. Wisconsin could choose the benchmark plan from North Dakota or New Jersey or Virginia.
When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back. And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy. It didn't take me a long time to figure that one out. Believe me.
Then, the following year, the court ruled that states could provide children with a de facto segregated education. This time, students in Detroit, represented by the NAACP, challenged a system in which blacks were concentrated in urban schools, surrounded by heavily white suburbs. A federal district court ruled that Michigan had to bus children between Detroit and its suburbs to create integrated schools for all.
The tax-credit issue has become a flash point between GOP leaders and their conservative flank, rooted in the amount of government spending it would take to achieve adequate health coverage in the ACA's absence.
The questions for Yang in Randolph were mostly friendly; even the skeptical ones, like about the risk of inflation if every American got a fat check in the mail, were the kind of elementary stuff he had dealt with before. When the talk was over, the three dozen people at the house party grabbed every copy of Yang's book, and some made plans to see him talk again.
— Jan. 21, remarks at the CIA
Manafort acknowledges he worked for the billionaire but denies it was to advance Russian interests. The AP also reports that Manafort is a leading focus of the probe into possible collusion.
One is, I think, I would refer you WMATA to make sure that they, you know, what they're status is and their capacity, obviously, that they've done a lot of planning and, you know, former Councilman Jack Evans of all people understands the demands that D.C. has on an event like this.
Particularly as the electorate has become more polarized around issues such as taxes, health care and now, immigration, members are rewarded by their bases for fighting the good fight, for taking a stand, according to studies.
The reports include seizures possibly linked to e-cigarettes starting in 2010, and the reports were mostly in young vapers, Stat's Megan Thielking reports.
Officials have also been negotiating with advocates for immigrants to stall lawsuits that officials fear could have triggered a new border surge.
Robert Herring did not respond to several requests for an interview. Charles Herring spoke to The Washington Post, but would not allow a reporter to visit OAN's newsroom and would not make news executives available. Senior staff personal opinions are irrelevant, Herring said in an email to The Post. More than a dozen current and former OAN anchors, writers and producers spoke about their experiences at the channel, in many cases on condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements.
Grassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).
Obama portrayed the 2010 law revising the health-care system as a starter home, saying, You hope over time you can make improvements. He sought to tamp down public concern that some major insurance companies are abandoning the marketplaces that are a core part of the law and that remaining insurers are raising their rates. The higher prices do not affect most Americans who still get coverage through a job, the president said, and most of the approximately 10 million people with marketplace health plans are buffered by their subsidies.
That is above the average of 404 drug price increases in the first three days of January over the past five years. Nearly all of the price increases are below 10%, with the median price increase around 5%, according to [health-care research firm 3 Axis Advisors], Michael writes. …Under pressure from politicians and patients, many makers of branded drugs have pledged to keep annual U.S. price increases below 10% a year.
The coronavirus outbreak has allowed Trump to step up his campaign to restrict immigration, including by effectively shutting down unauthorized crossings at the southern border. Using emergency powers ostensibly linked to the coronavirus crisis, Trump has implemented immigration restrictions that he has long tried to enforce, only to be blocked by courts and regulations. The new policies, which effectively suspend laws protecting minors and asylum seekers, allow border agents to quickly deport or turn away people seeking to enter the country.
Replace itemized deductions with a higher standard deduction. The plan would cut most individual tax breaks and benefits except the earned income tax credit and deductions for mortgage interest, charitable giving and education expenses. Republicans would instead increase the standard deduction to $12,000 from $6,300 for single individuals and to $18,000 for single individuals with a child. Married couples filing jointly would see their deduction increase to $24,000 from $12,600.
The VA secretary's fall underscores the growing clout that CVA is wielding in the Trump era through a national grass-roots network and sympathetic officials in the White House.
It's about understanding that access to affordable health care should not be a privilege; it should be a right, Harris told NBC's Kasie Hunt. It's about understanding that in a democracy, and the way we have constructed our democracy, we at least in concept have said that your access to public education, public health or public safety should not be a function of how much money you have.
Work requirements generally require people to work or participate in education or job training to get safety net health insurance. Democrats say that the requirements go against Medicaid's purpose as a guarantees benefit for low-income and disabled people.
First came Trump's tweet, sent out right before the Sunday news shows: Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare! he wrote.
That TDS would eventually grace Trump's Twitter feed was inevitable, it was in the bloodstream. Brian Kilmeade had been discussing the term on Fox News just a half-hour before the Helsinki tweet, and the idea that criticism of Trump was a symptom of a diseased mind was tailor-made for a president fond of smearing his critics as mentally enfeebled (see: Crazy Megyn Kelly, very Low IQ individual Robert De Niro and — hey, why not? — dummy Charles Krauthammer).
He's not cutting Medicare in this budget, Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters Monday at the White House. Medicare spending will go up every single year by healthy margins, and there are no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.
The Associated Press does a good job of explaining how the health-care overhaul dovetails with the opioid crisis, in a bad way: The central issue is that the House health care bill would phase out Obamacare's expanded Medicaid, which allows states to provide federally backed insurance to low-income adults previously not eligible. Many people in that demographic are in their 20s and 30s and dealing with opioid addiction. Dollars from Washington have allowed states to boost their response to the crisis, paying for medication, counseling, therapy and other services.
Pence is also playing a supporting role. He has hosted meetings with individual senators to discuss their concerns with the overhaul.
Two Senate Republicans would have to join Democrats for expansion to pass on a budget vote, the most conventional route for passage. But it would take only a single defection to pass it through a budget amendment. That's because the Senate's presiding officer, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), is allowed to break ties on budget amendments but not on the budget itself.
Trump's administration has certainly tried to look aggressive on the issue. The Food and Drug Administration says it has set a record for generic drug approvals. HHS has proposed requiring drugmakers to display prices in television ads, lowering some Medicare drug payments by pegging them to an international index and nixing secretive rebates exchanged between drug companies and pharmacy middlemen.
Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) paused for 17 seconds last night when Paul Kane asked him if Sanders can win the general election. I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask about winning a Democratic primary, but I think winning a primary election and winning a general election are two different things, said Bennet, who dropped out of the presidential race after garnering less than 1 percent of the vote in New Hampshire. Bennet expressed concern that Sanders could make it harder for John Hickenlooper, the former governor of his state, to defeat Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Bennet, the former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he believes Democrats need to nominate somebody in this process who is going to be able to win purple states like Colorado and lead us to a 55-senator majority in the Senate. That could be challenging.
Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
-- A new CNN-SSRS poll showed Harris has jumped in their poll by eight points since December. CNN's Jennifer Agiesta reports: Biden (28%) and Sanders (20%) continue to hold the top slots in the large Democratic field. Harris now stands at 12% support ... up from 4% in December, and [O'Rourke] stands at 11%.
Republicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the Senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. That means the narrow Democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 Republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. And with the slimmest possible majority, Democrats will have to stick together. A single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.
Don't believe us? We have the receipts.
RUBIO: ... They were not hired...
The impact of the harmful policies included in Arkansas' waiver has been so alarming that even the independent, nonpartisan Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission wrote to you stating they were 'highly concerned' about the number of individuals losing coverage… and going as far as to say that forcing people off of coverage as a result of such policies should be halted, they wrote.
Meanwhile, Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was in full-on defense mode, insisting in a Washington Post op-ed that block grants don't amount to spending cuts for the health insurance program that covers 1 in 5 Americans.
RUBIO: No, there are several. Obviously there are so many, I can't talk to them every day. I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened. They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.
If you open the borders, my God, there's a lot of poverty in this world, and you're going to have people from all over the world, Sanders said. And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point. Can't do it. So that is not my position.
So I think as we move forward, we'll have additional details on -- on how that's going to happen and the actual details of the plan. But as you can imagine, it's something that involves a lot of coordination and a lot of planning.
Trump has gone after abortion providers and access to the procedure through agency regulations, judicial appointments and budget requests. He most recently used strong language to describe Virginia and New York measures making it easier to obtain abortions late in pregnancy, calling on Congress to pass antiabortion legislation and even personally confronting Democrats over the issue.
Andrew Yang: Well, even then when you say continuing basis, I mean that you can define a timeline, like the timeline could be prolonged and measured in years and still be the right mission.
As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top. I think we're going to win it anyway.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on Feb. 7 introduced a resolution they call the Green New Deal. (The Washington Post)
Sanders was, well, Sanders, ignoring the cost of Medicare-for-all, decrying Wall Street greed, boasting of his vote against the Iraq War and making clear he was the most dovish in the pack. He lacked a good answer on his voting record on guns. His opposition to the trade agreement only illustrated his ideological rigidity further.
It is not clear the extent to which the separation policy actually contributed to deterring families from arriving at the border, though, according to multiple administration officials, that was explicitly one of the points of the program, our Post colleague Philip Bump reports. What is clear, though, is the policy of pulling apart families at the border is one of the least popular Trump has proposed during his presidency.
Without exception, the major veterans organizations say we have got to strengthen VA, not dismember it, not privatize it, Sanders said Sunday on CNN. And I will do everything I can as a member of the veterans committee not to approve any nominee who is not going to strengthen VA and who will oppose privatization.
Pundits and reporters who lament this erosion in decorum are wildly missing the point, says Post opinion writer Greg Sargent. (The Washington Post)
That means hospitals aren't paid for many of the virtual services they provide to elderly patients, even though they say it has allowed them to improve in some key areas including shortened hospitalizations, reduced mortality rates in intensive care units and fewer incidences of sepsis.
It's a 150-page bill … it's not an eight-page resolution, Jayapal told me yesterday. Now we're actually putting detail into it, and so we feel confident we will continue to add cosponsors even after introduction.
But expansion advocates hope it does not merely squeak out of the chamber. Firm support for expansion from House Republicans could strengthen that chamber's hand in budget negotiations with the Senate, which is expected to pass a rival budget plan Thursday without expansion.
It is noteworthy that by a significant margin in three key states — Arizona (52/36), Ohio (51/35) and Florida (49/40) — voters prefer Congress as a check on Trump rather than assisting him in pushing through his agenda. Only about a third of voters in these states think Trump deserves reelection.
But not from Tanden. When I called her that day, she said she thought the attacks on McCain were wrong. He had not made up his mind on whether to vote for repeal itself, she insisted. She spoke of her respect for McCain and her belief that, in the end, he would save Obamacare.
It would be extremely dangerous at this early stage in the life of the product, Friedman reportedly wrote, to make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to morphine…We are well aware of the view held by many physicians that oxycodone [the active ingredient in OxyContin] is weaker than morphine. I do not plan to do anything about that.
The scorecard, which grades all House and Senate members for their stances on abortion-related legislation, mostly gives A grades to Republicans and F grades to Democrats, with some exceptions. Just two of the 30 House Democrats in districts won by Trump got D or C grades: Rep. Ben McAdams of Utah and Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota.
The IRS didn't attempt to send out payments to certain other clients of tax preparers because the system couldn't find their direct deposit information. The glitch potentially impacts up to 21 million people, according to consumer law expert Vijay Raghavan. The IRS has also used some 2018 taxpayer data, and some people have died or changed banks, further complicating the process.
The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes money to help states process and cover the increasing number of unemployment insurance claims. A record 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the biggest jump ever in new jobless claims, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
A small proportion of partisans people feel extreme hostility toward opponents
We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.
In both cases, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has joined with the court's liberals — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — in voting against the challenges. Some Democrats were open in their hopes that the court take up the next challenge before there were any changes to that group.
If congressional intent is the key to [the Texas lawsuit's] decision, Congress can intervene, Bagley and Primus write. And the best way for it to do so is not to enter the litigation, as [Pelosi] has said she'll do. It's to legislate. Congress could fix the problem by saving, severing, or sinking the mandate.
Here are the other health-care takeaways from Trump's address:
At 2 a.m. Friday morning, he logged into the portal again and saw he had finally been approved — a month after he applied.
Two House GOPers added their voices to those calling for Pruitt's resignation: Two moderate Republicans in Democratic-leaning House districts — Florida Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen — called on Pruitt to step down. Curbelo tweeted that Pruitt's 'corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the Administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers.' Others came to his defense, including Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), a longtime supporter.
I can say walking out of that Oval Office today, this is a deeply-held conviction, Dannenfelser said. Yes, it is a politically smart move he's made in advancing human rights in this way. But it's also the right thing to do.
Later that day, Trump retweeted a tweet from a supporter who wrote that millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain.
That's a myth that can be traced to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the 1939 film in which Jimmy Stewart's character filibusters to heroic effect. In reality, the filibuster has often been deployed to frustrate majority rule, or simply to rally supporters, as when Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina stood on the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in an unsuccessful bid to stop a civil rights bill. Under the idea floated by Manchin and others, filibusters would more closely resemble Mr. Smith -- the vote would be delayed only so long as a bill's opponents actively held the floor.
Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) on Feb. 10 scolded Neera Tanden, the nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, for her Twitter history. (C-SPAN)
Week 1387, drop letters from a movie title
TRUMP: ... She's trying to get out of the case. She's trying to get out of the case...
The theory is that removing sicker people from the markets and allowing policies with skimpier options would result in lower overall premiums.
For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he gave during the campaign in which he promised to not have people dying on the street.
Clinton occupies a unique place in history as the only person to have both parents run for president, and she has been particularly active in this campaign. While the children of candidates have always played a role in politics, they seem to have an outsize role in 2016 as the adult children of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take turns on the stump to vouch for the flawed candidates.
I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia. But, guess what? It's now March Madness and we're heading up North to the place -- to my turf, OK?
As the New York Times's Jim Tankersley notes, more than 70 financial institutions have announced higher wages and bonuses for workers, accounting for about half of all companies that have promised to share the wealth from the cuts with employees. But, he writes, those goodies reflect a small slice of the windfall that banks large and small are in line to receive.
Some Republicans like Heye point to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as a bridge builder unique for the Trump era. McCarthy has served in Congress for nearly a decade, and he has somehow managed to be one of the establishment figures in Congress closest to Trump. My Kevin, Trump has taken to calling him.
I'll keep watching it until it gets better.
At the Whitaker hearing, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), in his debut as the ranking Republican, sought to defend Trump's accidental AG with morphing metaphors: A character assassination . . . Hide-and-seek game . . . Plenty of stunts . . . Maybe we just set up a popcorn machine . . . Dog-and-pony show . . . This is no way to run the railroad . . . Mr. Whitaker, this is your life. Like the old TV show, they just want a piece of you.
We're just trying to get back on our feet, and we're now slammed with all these bills we owe, said Ryan, who lives with her boyfriend.
The Democrat called for expedited approval of benefits to 70,000 additional low-income residents in the state and called for the state's health agency to work with lawmakers to find a way to fund the expanded program. The plan still needs to be approved by federal regulators.
Last week, state Sen. Frank W. Wagner (Virginia Beach) said he supports expansion under certain conditions. Those include a tax credit for middle-­income people who already have insurance but are struggling to pay soaring premiums and co-pays. He also wants to beef up the work requirement that the House wants imposed on Medicaid recipients.
As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
A total of 6,769 sexual assaults were reported in the U.S. military during the last fiscal year, the Pentagon said in a report in April. The figure represents a 10 percent increase from the previous year, our Post colleague Felicia Sonmez reports. Those who report their assaults frequently face retaliation. According to the Pentagon, 58 percent of those who reported assaults in 2017 — including two-thirds of women — said they faced some sort of backlash in their unit.
The drug industry has sharply criticized any attempt to share vaccine patents or the technological knowledge needed to manufacture them, despite global need, the Intercept's Lee Fang reports.
A day after Vice President Pence touted a new policy allowing 'any American' to be tested for the novel coronavirus with a doctor's order … Health experts warned the action might inadvertently send the wrong message, prompting a surge in demand for tests from people with mild symptoms who should simply stay home until they recover. They also noted that laboratory capacity for virus testing, while on the rise, is still lagging. Tests that can be done in doctor's offices don't exist, Amy Goldstein, Carolyn Johnson, Lena Sun and Laurie McGinley report. Sixty public health labs are now running the just-fixed CDC test. In the next several days and weeks, testing capacity is expected to increase as more labs come online and private companies ship thousands of test kits. Pence's announcement took many officials at [HHS] and the CDC by surprise, according to an HHS official.
By then, HBO had already passed on Silvershow.
This package has support on both sides of the aisle, Murray said on the Senate floor. With the health and well-being of women and babies on the line, now is not the time for nickle-and-diming, Murray said. There is no reason we can't get a strong emergency funding proposal to the president's desk this week.
Trump's election initially appeared to vindicate DeMint's approach. Heritage served as a policy and staff pipeline for the Trump campaign and the transition, helping provide a blueprint for the White House's 2018 budget proposal. Last week, during a speech to the National Rifle Association, Trump personally thanked DeMint and Heritage for supporting the confirmation of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
Quickly end inner-city violence, which Trump has repeatedly compared to war zones. I'll be able to make sure that when you walk down the street in your inner city, or wherever you are, you're not going to be shot. Your child isn't going to be shot. (Trump said recently that urban areas remain dangerous places and used that as a centerpiece of his campaign.)
So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, What's your problem?
Columnist Ruth Marcus explains what the chief justice may or may not do in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial. (The Washington Post)
If I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it. (He threatened North Korea with fire and fury if it continued to threaten the United States, but despite cordial relations with Kim, the threats remained.)
In December, the measles situation was on the table, and the polio situation was on the table. If you've got a vaccine so good it prevents almost all cases, and it prevents transmission, you vaccinate your population, and you're fine even though it still exists elsewhere in the world, Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told The Washington Post. That was the perspective, which was legit. Now … that's looking like a stretch.
But it isn't easy. I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing. Everything in the federal government specifically. You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat. In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.
We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
Trevor Noah looked at some of the things India is doing to give Trump a memorable experience:
In addition, White House press secretary Sean Spicer left the door open at Monday's briefing to further efforts. We're at the beginning of a process, he said. I don't think we've seen the end of health care.
President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Obama's signature health-care law with the goal of insurance for everybody, while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid.
Trump's vanquished 2016 rival also refused to answer questions from reporters at CNN and the Times about whether Trump's July 25 call was perfect:
Ryan said the GOP will offer its own proposal this year for replacing the law, saying it would lower costs and restore the doctor-patient relationship. Republicans have struggled unsuccessfully for years to coalesce behind a replacement plan.
It will take years to undo the damage but an important first step we must take is to hold the parties responsible for this epidemic legally liable for the destruction they have unleashed upon our citizens, Marshall said in a statement.
Triple the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. (The size of ICE has not increased substantially during Trump's presidency.)
Flashing text alert will read 'Stop looking at your texts!' (Hannah Seidel, Alexandria, Va.)
I continue to support repealing and replacing Obamacare with reforms that actually reduce health-care costs and increase coverage for Upstate New Yorkers, he said at the time. But as a lifelong and consistent supporter of women's rights and health care, I do not support addressing divisive social issues such as access to birth control on a last-minute continuing resolution.
Cigna is calling for an average premium increase of 15 percent for the company's 103,264 customers in the state, raising prices 6.4 to 40 percent depending on the plan. CareFirst proposed an average 64 percent increase for its 4,500 customers in the state. The rates aren't final, and both companies could decide to ease back if they feel enough pressure from regulators.
-- The District will see rain today and throughout the weekend. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Off-and-on periods of rain are probable. Maybe some thunder. A somewhat stationary front is hanging out for most of the day, a bit too close for comfort (or confident forecast). Heavier (flooding?) rains may focus along this front, with perhaps the best odds of that south vs. north. Up north, it could be a relatively uneventful rain as far as rain goes. Stay tuned since we're on the edge of the worst.
In the legislation, you will find a line item for a long list of social needs. What you will not find is a new or transformational role for government. A great deal of money is devoted to shoring up existing programs and institutions, as you'd expect during a national emergency. Some of the largest elements of the stimulus — the $1,400 checks, the $300 weekly unemployment insurance subsidy, the refundable child credit — go directly to individuals to use as they please. The transfer of $350 billion to states and localities is federalism exemplified.
Annie Clark, communications director for Collins, countered by referring to Kavanaugh's December vote in Planned Parenthood's favor. During his confirmation process, Planned Parenthood was Justice Kavanaugh's number one opponent, Clark said in a statement. They went after him with everything that they had. And yet, when it came to a case involving them, he was able to put that aside and rule impartially and independently.
Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.
False claims hang over a Trump-loving county's plans to buy Dominion voting machines , by Hannah Knowles: It was a good deal for the county, years in the making, says Board of Elections Director Jeff Matthews, who heads the Stark County GOP as well. It was also a step into a firestorm — Donald Trump's supporters were falsely accusing Dominion Voting Systems of helping to rig the 2020 results… Two months later, Stark County has yet to replace its aging voting equipment while May primaries loom.
Writing from Marianna, Ark., Amy writes of confusion over the program and little evidence as to whether it's motivating people to find jobs.
— Stay tuned for the latest health-care proposal from Democrats. Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Reps. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.) and Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) are planning to announce legislation allowing people the option of buying in to Medicare between the ages of 50 to 64.
We will build a great wall along the southern border.
-- North Korea's state media said Democratic lawmakers and the U.S. intelligence community will be to blame if the summit does not prove fruitful. Reuters's Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin report: After weeks of silence about the summit in Vietnam, North Korea's state news agency KCNA on Sunday announced Kim's departure by train … KCNA later issued a commentary arguing that if Trump listened to skeptics at home, he could face a 'shattered dream' and 'miss the rare historic opportunity' to improve relations with North Korea. … Trump's opponents would bear the responsibility if the summit failed to achieve results, which would leave the U.S. people exposed to 'security threats', it said.
The court had earlier turned down a request from Democratic-led states and the House of Representatives to hear the case this spring.
Over the years, Republicans have compared this misguided Obama pledge with the increase in annual family premiums for employer-provided plans, even though the ACA largely was aimed at the individual insurance market. Back in January, for instance, Vice President Pence said American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000. That statistic reflected the change in employer-provided insurance premiums from 2010 to 2016, as documented by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A billion-dollar question: How much does Bloomberg now help Biden in the upcoming primaries? Bloomberg has pledged to employ large field staffs in six swing states in the general election, even though he is no longer a candidate. The billionaire's data operation, Hawkfish, will also continue operating to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, Matt Viser and Amy Wang report. Bloomberg's aides, however, have not announced whether they will take out ads in the primary campaign to help Biden or whether Bloomberg campaign staffers in upcoming primary states will work for Biden's nomination. Campaign finance rules generally give self-funded campaigns significant leeway to spend money, even if the funds support other candidates. Bloomberg also has the option of renaming or rehiring his staff as part of a separate independent group to help Biden.
We don't have to be intimidated by the scope and scale of this challenge, Azar said at a news conference late last week. We can do it now.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families, Trump said. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
He decided not to sign up.
George W. Bush's inability to reform Social Security in 2005, fresh off a commanding reelection victory, is a more recent reminder of how hard it is to tinker with the safety net — even on the margins.
Klobuchar's final commercial before the primary is called Empathy, and its message is that she feels your pain and sympathizes with your hardships. She talks at length in her speeches about her father's alcoholism and the struggles now to pay for his long-term care. I know you, and I will fight for you, she said at the close of her 40-minute speech. I want you to know this because I need your help right now. We are on the cusp of something really great.
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.
Speaking of swing states . . . there's uproar in Florida over rulemaking around Amendment 4, focusing on how to define completion, murder and sexual offense.
Research has shown that expanding Medicaid resulted in more women having continuous health coverage in the months after giving birth. Medicaid expansion was associated with a 10.1 percentage-point decline in insurance churn compared with non-expansion, in a study published in the journal Health Affairs.
Oh, I hear that, that not enough is being done, but I see the glass as half full, not empty, Paul said. We've done a whole lot — repealing regulations, getting [Supreme Court Justice Neil] Gorsuch through in record time, and we still have a great likelihood of getting tax reduction through in the fall. It's been productive.
Catherine Rampell, an opinion columnist at The Post:
But, for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald's record right now as he standing here...
SPICER: I want to kick off with a quick correction.
CRUZ: ... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.
—From the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it an escalation of the Trump administration and Republicans' attacks on protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Health 202: And Azar's Medicare Part B demonstration would involve a pretty small share of Medicare drug spending.
The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health holds a hearing on legislation to improve American's health-care coverage and outcomes on Wednesday.
On many other matters, Cotton has advocated for Trump. During his town hall, he was asked about Trump's decision not to release his tax returns, a controversial position that has drawn increasing criticism, even from Republicans.
We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
That's like then you get more success, more cable news appearances, like your team pats you on the back and says, Great job. You didn't say anything that was off your talking points.
Because both Clinton and Trump have such high negatives showcasing their trophy children is a smart move, said historian and author, Douglas Brinkley. Their children are mature and accomplished. In a sense, the kids are the most super of super-surrogates for Clinton and Trump.
A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found 62 percent of African American respondents said abortion should be legal in all/most cases.
President Trump has the right mind-set regarding his proposed budget, said Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative group. Congress, however, needs to make entitlement reform a priority if we are to address the nation's burgeoning national debt in the long term.
If it wasn't crystal clear before, it was now, Richards wrote, per People Magazine. Jared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win. In their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers. It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women's rights for more money. It takes a lot to get Kirk mad, but it looked like his head was about to explode.
The budget also includes $120 million for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to deliver additional care and treatment for people living with HIV through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, including $50 million in proposed funding for community health centers at HRSA for expanded PrEP services. The Indian Health Services also would receive $25 million to enhance HIV testing and referrals to care.
In June, the Supreme Court extended employment-discrimination protections to LGBT Americans, but it left a harder issue unresolved. What about the religious baker who can't, in good conscience, cater a same-sex wedding? The Catholic adoption agency that feels it can't place kids with same-sex couples? The Mormon university that objects to including same-sex spouses in dorms for married students? In those and similar cases, LGBT rights advocates and religious-liberty advocates have been at loggerheads, fighting a pitched battle in the courts and using scorched-earth, apocalyptic rhetoric.
We could never play with shareholder money at the level being played by the Koch brothers or Tom Steyer, said one top corporate executive, referring to the hundreds of millions spent in recent years by the libertarian energy moguls and the environmentally conscious hedge-fund manager.
Klobuchar emphasizes her ability to topple Trump in a head-to-head matchup in a way that Warren does not. During a town hall on Saturday, Klobuchar told voters that she had just been texting backstage with Cindy McCain, the widow of the 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain. She always highlights the inroads she's made with Republicans as a senator in Washington and during her three statewide victories in Minnesota. I have won every red and purple, suburban and rural congressional district every single time I've run, she likes to say. I have won every race, every place, every time all the way down to fourth grade, where my slogan that I have since abandoned was, 'All the way with Amy K.'
Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on the 21st Century Cures Act.
Tom Steyer, of all people, prefaced the great ingathering of Democrats when he departed the race after South Carolina. Beginning with a heartfelt farewell speech and a breath-taking appearance at Biden's side on Monday, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said that his campaign for unity, decency and anti-extremism was best served by supporting Biden. Biden bestowed the highest compliment he could on Buttigieg. I don't think I've ever done this before, but he reminds me of my son Beau, Biden said. That may not mean much to most people, but to me, it's the highest compliment I can give any man or woman. He added, Like Beau, he has a backbone ... like a ramrod. It was as gripping and emotional a moment as you will see in politics.
OOF: The Senate Finance Committee deadlocked on advancing Xavier Becerra for health and human services secretary.
Republicans pushed back, airing their well-worn accusation that the health-care law was rotten to the core. The problem is with the ship, not the deck chairs on the ship, said Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.)
Senator Sessions is obviously (inaudible) qualified to be the next attorney general. His career has been exemplary. He is an experienced crime fighter, a man of integrity and high accomplishment, who has always pursued justice fairly and equitably. Senator Sessions is known for his respect and adherence to the rule of law, a cornerstone of our democracy. He will ensure equal justice under the law for all Americans and keep politics out of the judicial system.
Cruz came to Washington in 2012, and his impressive and fearless campaign to jam it up ever since has helped the senator from Texas make a name for himself as the obstructor in chief. His willingness to do so -- sometimes for no discernible benefit than his own political gain -- also has made him a very difficult person for the rest of Congress to like.
Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.
Among Fox Corp.'s first acts in business: appointing former House speaker Paul D. Ryan to its board of directors. Ryan is, of course, an establishment conservative disliked by both Democrats and those who most strongly supported Trump. Although he advanced some of Trump's agenda, particularly tax reform, as speaker, Ryan declined to defend Trump or campaign with him in the latter stages of the 2016 campaign. Trump's [critical tweets about Fox] served as a reminder that he is known for turning on members of his inner circle. … It also raised the question: Is the president changing his tune on Fox News?
On that day in 2011, the House's new GOP majority approved Ryan's budget plan — which, in defiance of all political instincts, called for cuts in a government program that voters knew and loved: Medicare. Ryan (R-Wis.), worried about debt, wanted eventually to turn the massive ­health-benefit program over to private insurers.
KELLY: All right. Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz. Go ahead.
Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.
I met Leo at the Federalist Society's offices in Washington. Despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the Trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.
Barr declined to answer directly a hypothetical question from Blumenthal, who pressed the nominee on whether he would approve an indictment of Trump if Mueller came to him with proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the president had violated the law.
Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.
Under federal law, one of the most basic and important jobs ONDCP has is to issue a national drug control strategy, Cummings plans to say, in remarks shared in advance with Health 202.  However, in all of 2017, the Trump Administration failed to meet this most basic statutory requirement. In 2018, it was no different. No strategy was issued. Let that sink in for a moment. For two years—more than half of President Trump's term—the White House had no national drug control strategy. All while tens of thousands of people were dying and the crisis was escalating every single day....There was no sense of urgency. There was no sense of passion or purpose.
-- The GOP won a closely watched Texas special election last night. From the AP: The victory by Republican Gary Gates, who put more than $1.5 million of his own money into his run for state House District 28, is sure to bring a sigh of relief for the GOP in a race that was being tracked far beyond Texas. By the final weeks, the race had escalated into the first big special election of 2020. In final unofficial results, Gates polled 58% of the vote to 42% for Democrat Eliz Markowitz. [Biden and Warren] had endorsed Markowitz, and outside groups flooded the race with six-figure checks and television ads. Beto O'Rourke practically made the district a second home after ending his own presidential campaign in November, spending weekends knocking on doors in Katy's affluent neighborhoods.
They are really going after the Obamacare expansion population as they have done throughout the administration, Vitti told me. There's a line between the AHCA failure years ago and going for the hatchet now.
Behind the scenes, Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to look at this week's votes as mere procedural formalities. But some rank-and-file members remain nervous about voting to start a process they might not be able to stop.
Asked about whether he would leave prosecutorial decisions entirely to Mueller — as Richardson promised to do for a special prosecutor — Barr noted the special counsel regulations gave him the power to veto major steps. That veto, he noted, would have to be reported to Congress.
Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation's debt over 10 years, even if the economy grows the way that you say it will. You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that, you say, by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.
Biden no instó a la unidad a expensas de los principios, o al servicio de alguna agenda política suave. Su referencia al derecho a disentir y estar en desacuerdo como quizás la mayor fortaleza de esta nación, de ninguna manera negó que él también lucharía por lo que él y quienes votaron por él creen, incluidas acciones largamente pospuestas para detener el cambio climático y desarraigar el racismo sistémico. Llamó a la supremacía blanca por su nombre y se comprometió a derrotarla. Mientras que hace cuatro años Trump lanzó una mentira extraña exagerando el número de asistentes a su ceremonia, Biden exigió adhesión a la verdad.
Barnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down Washington pressure group. The society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. No one at Federalist Society headquarters in Washington dictated Barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. It's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the Federalist Society that Barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and Barnett took it from there. Multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the Federalist Society's true source of power.
We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.
AHH: Final enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces were only slightly lower this year, despite the Trump administration's move to slash most advertising and outreach funding. About 11.8 million customers actively selected or were automatically re-enrolled in coverage, down from 12.2 million who signed up last year, according to figures released yesterday afternoon by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
As with so much about Trump, the whole Obama thing would be amusing if he did not have the power to make life-or-death decisions.
Charles Herring won't say how much, if any, profit OAN makes. He said the family company has been in the black since 2009. We don't make a lot of money, but we have a lot of fun, he said.
 I made it possible for her to be where she is today, George replied. So there's that. It's not about jealousy. It's about reality. Who this man is, and whether he's fit for public office. Which, as I've said, he isn't.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on vaccines on March 5.
Buttigieg said it was too soon to say, because he couldn't be sure which country Trump would have pissed off by then.
Michael Adelberg, a health-care principal at FaegreBD Consulting, considers the subsidies the single most important action the administration can take to stabilize the marketplace. Refusing to pay them will bring significant premium increases, Adelberg said in an email. Some insurers will drop out, and the remaining insurers will have to seek large rate increases.
This morning, the president (sic) and (ph) vice-president elect was in Washington, as he will be for the remainder of his time before the inauguration. He had his daily intelligence briefing. He will also attend transition meetings in Washington, D.C. before travelling up here to New York for meetings with the president-elect. He will remain in New York over night and return back to Washington.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) described the electoral college as a work of genius by the founders. It makes sure the interests of less populated areas aren't ignored at the expense of densely populated areas, he wrote.
We're talking different options, said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health. We are working together — this is not top-down; this is bottom-up.

The National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research program hosts a live Twitter chat on digital health technology and the future of health research.
I am focusing on stopping the 'Democrats' Medicare for none' scheme, McConnell added.
Democrats have tried do away with the Hyde language before, but there may be a stronger political climate for such an effort now, Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who specializes in the legal history of reproduction rights, told me.
But simply being a close ally of Trump's doesn't mean much. Former senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was allied with Trump and was even reportedly under consideration to serve as vice president during the 2016 campaign. But Corker, too, criticized Trump's handling of Charlottesville, and became a focus of frequent attacks by the president. He decided against seeking reelection in 2018.
Democrats will lose a lot of legislative battles, but they have all kinds of means at their disposal to try to throw the actual GOP agenda into sharper relief in the eyes of the public.
That promise right there — an effective, government-run website that will address a key health-care need — is maybe the boldest of Biden's presidency. The government's track record on such endeavors, after all, is not fantastic.
While visiting Iowa for a Trump rally, Pence walked into a diner ready to glad-hand some locals. Unfortunately for him, one of the diner's patrons was an emergency physician named Rob Davidson, who is also the executive director of an organization of doctors, medical professionals and activists called the Committee to Protect Medicare. Davidson was in town for a committee news conference on threats to health coverage.
Facing pressure from constituent groups who say he has been avoiding them, Rep. Dave Brat on Tuesday afternoon announced that he would hold a Facebook town hall that same evening.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie called the policy the most transformative piece of legislation since the G.I. Bill in an interview with the Times. It gets us on the road to becoming a 21st-century health-care institution, he said.
But Trump doesn't have the patience or the stomach to seek — much less achieve — all of that. He demonstrated once again this week that he has no interest in being a wartime president. After the Iranian ballistic missiles fell harmlessly while U.S. troops waited safely in their bunkers, Trump quickly decided not to retaliate against Iran's retaliation. As soon as he saw a door marked EXIT, he took it.
Political control R Trump R Senate R House Why it happened Sen. Rand Paul briefly filibustered a two-year bipartisan spending bill over its cost. Democrats wanted a solution for dreamers, immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. How it was resolved After the time for debate expired, Congress voted overnight to increase domestic and military spending caps and to fund the government. No deal was made for dreamers. Read more
In 2020, American astronauts returned to space on American-made rockets, a feat that had been impossible since the space shuttle was retired in 2011. It was a bright spot in a garbage year, courtesy of SpaceX and NASA. There will be forces in the Biden administration hostile to anything that smacks of privatization. But to keep racking up space successes, all Joe Biden has to do is cut-and-paste Obama-era policies — especially the federal government's relationship to the commercial space industry.
In a 2010 speech at Dartmouth College, Bloomberg said: We passed a health-care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health-care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace. The president, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to Congress, which didn't pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that's going to cost a lot of money.
As states invest more resources in addressing the opioid overdose epidemic, attention should be paid to the role that Medicaid expansion may play in reducing opioid overdose mortality, most likely through the provision of anti-addiction medication, the researchers wrote.
The commercial group business of a fourth co-op in New Mexico has been acquired by health-plan manager Evolent Health, although that co-op continues to sell individual plans. And the group organized in 2010 to support the co-ops — the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops — has shuttered.
Spur the spending of $1 trillion in public and private funds on infrastructure projects over 10 years. Invest in transportation, clean water, a modern and reliable electricity grid, telecommunications, security infrastructure and other pressing domestic infrastructure needs without adding to the national debt. (Despite repeated infrastructure weeks, no significant infrastructure legislation was passed on Trump's watch.)
-- Meanwhile, key offices are continuing to gather dust as the Trump administration drags its feet on the slowest transition in decades. The New York Times' Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Sharon LaFraniere report: From the moment he was sworn in, [Trump] faced a personnel crisis, starting virtually from scratch in lining up senior leaders for his administration. Seven weeks into the job, he is still hobbled by the slow start, months behind where experts in both parties, even some inside his administration, say he should be. The lag has left critical power centers in his government devoid of leadership as he struggles to advance policy priorities … Mr. Trump's personnel problems are rooted in a dysfunctional transition effort … compounded by roadblocks of his own making: a loyalty test that in some cases has eliminated qualified candidates, a five-year lobbying ban that has discouraged some of the most sought-after potential appointees, and a general sense of upheaval at the White House that has repelled many others. 'There's no question this is the slowest transition in decades,' said [former State Department official] R. Nicholas Burns … 'It is a very, very big mistake. The world continues — it doesn't respect transitions.'
He was a longtime board member of the First Bank and Trust, which his father helped establish.
But Frieden added that he doesn't think it's wrong for someone in a low-risk group who'd already had the illness to defer if they thought someone else could use the dose. One health system asked workers to do just that, Frieden recently noted on Twitter:
That means that in one week, Ryan is 0-2 in battles with his caucus.
The Department of Health and Human Services was abuzz yesterday as Secretary Alex Azar and top officials announced that states can now seek permission to rewrite their rules around who can enroll in Medicaid. It's the administration's latest move to reconfigure Medicaid to discourage enrollment by able-bodied adults and prioritize care for the most vulnerable.
• Make two years of community college tuition-free for all, and all public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose family incomes are below $125,000.
That moment was the crystallizing moment for me, says Amy Zvi, Silverman's longtime manager and an executive producer on the show. Rather than say, 'You realize that you're wrong and I'm right,' Sarah didn't correct them.
AHH: Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced it will start selling a generic version of its popular insulin product, Humalog, at 50 percent of the current price.
Sanford lost, but it's not clear what role if any Trump's tweet might have played. In fact, it's not clear how much weight Trump's endorsements have overall, much less how much they'll carry once he's out of office and, to at least some extent, the public eye.
President Trump doubled down April 4 on his decision to fire Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general at the center of impeachment. (The Washington Post)
The relentless pressure from Wall Street also eroded the enlightened self-interest that made it possible for executives to put the country's interests first. In his book The Fracturing of the Corporate Elite, sociologist Mark Mizruchi of the University of Michigan argues that conflicts within the business community — between globalized companies and domestic ones, energy users and energy consumers, old economy companies and high-tech firms — have made it increasingly difficult for corporate leaders to reach consensus. As a result, big business has been largely missing in action on issues such as health care, climate change and even corporate tax reform.
The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. wrote Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), chair of the House Republican Conference, explaining why she was voting to impeach Trump. Everything that followed was his doing.
We need to be taught how to seek out the humanity in our neighbors. As our country still struggles mightily with racial injustice, religious stridency and misogyny, it's evident that seeing others clearly and compassionately doesn't come naturally.
The CBO is an important political tool for both sides in the health-care debate, since it puts real numbers to a complicated bill. Here are the three numbers we're looking at:
Here are four takeaways about the House's swift action and what lies ahead.

Take JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which announced their earnings Friday and revealed they stand to collect a combined $7 billion in tax relief. Bloomberg News's Hugh Son and Laura J. Keller summarize the competing demands on that haul: Borrowers including small businesses and big corporations will want better pricing. Employees from tellers to rainmakers will press for raises and bigger bonuses. And then there's the political pressure banks face to invest more in communities, particularly those with the least access to credit.
Booker noted it would take just three Republicans to halt the whole process by refusing to back the bill.
The CBO estimated the stimulus provision, which increases subsidies for private plans purchased on HealthCare.gov, would cost $34.2 billion to get 1.7 million more people into the individual marketplaces. Of those, 1.3 million would be previously uninsured, while the rest would be people transitioning to marketplace plans from some other type of health coverage, report our colleagues Paige Cunningham and Alex Ellerbeck in today's Health 202
House Republican leaders attempted to quell concerns of a skittish rank and file before a key vote Friday to begin unwinding the Affordable Care Act.
Dingell was elected to replace his father, who died of tuberculosis, in a special election. John Dingell Sr. had been elected on Franklin Roosevelt's coattails in 1932 and emerged as a leading champion of the New Deal. John Sr. stood behind FDR as he signed the law creating Social Security. John Jr. presided over the House when Medicare passed in 1965. He lent the gavel he had used that day to Nancy Pelosi when the House voted out the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
Today, he's expected to sign an order rescinding the so-called Mexico City rule prohibiting groups in other countries from performing or encouraging abortions if they want federal family planning dollars. The rule has ping-ponged for decades, alternately instituted by GOP presidents and scrapped by Democratic ones. Biden is also expected to restore advertising and navigators to promote the Affordable Care Act and reopen Healthcare.gov from Feb. 15 to May 15.
We find that politicians show a significantly stronger pull toward the sunk-cost fallacy than do ordinary citizens. They agree to extend programs that have incurred such costs far more often than citizens do; larger sunk costs do not deter them from doing so.
You can look at it as socialized medicine, Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) told digital news site HuffPost earlier this month. But in the face of an outbreak, a pandemic, what's your options?
UPDATE: Besides Obamacare, Republicans on the Hill push back by pointing out Ryan and Trump agree on the majority of this year's congressional agenda: Ending sanctuary cities, cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, tax reform, having some kind of barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing responsibly with everyone President Obama deferred deportations to.
Dingell reflected on his proudest moments when Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom:
• With friends like these: Trump remarks irk some NATO members, says the banner on Fox News at almost the same time.
Idaho's new governor, Republican Brad Little, has notably said he will uphold voters' will by supporting Medicaid expansion. But the state's attorney general is defending the ballot initiative in a lawsuit brought by the Idaho Freedom Foundation. The state's Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday.
Beijing for months had rejected calls for a probe into the origins of the virus, later ­agreeing to a WHO-led investigation only if it was not country-specific. Chinese officials have pushed theories that the virus came from outside the country while controlling related research and blocking domestic scientists from publishing independent studies into the causes of the outbreak, Emily and Lily write.
The big question underlying all of this: whether defeat might crush or at least marginalize Trumpism as a force inside the party, by driving home to most mainstream GOP lawmakers, particularly in the House, that the party is staring in the face of long-term demographic doom, and that only cutting loose Trumpism can change that. (As I've suggested, a Trump loss in a place like Arizona might really help focus the minds of mainstream Republicans.) You'd think a large enough defeat could accomplish that. But conservative writer Philip Klein makes the case that, paradoxically enough, Trump's loss could actually strengthen the hold on GOP voters of the arguments some Trump supporters will make about his loss, making moderation even harder:
A group of researchers combed through records of 1.8 million Florida hospital births between 1992 and 2015 looking for clues that might explain why mortality rates are disproportionately high for Black babies. They found a tantalizing statistic. Although Black newborns are three times as likely to die as White newborns, when Black babies are delivered by Black doctors, their mortality rate is cut in half, Tonya Russell writes for The Post.
In a subsequent statement, however, the pair criticized six other health care-related bills that passed with only Democratic support, including measures to reverse the Trump administration's expansion of short-term, limited-duration health plans and a measure to protect patients with preexisting conditions.
Here's what I know, he says. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.
The most telling part of that interview was her response when asked whether it was a mistake to release a video and give new life to President Trump's nasty Pocahontas taunt. I can't go back, she says. But did she learn from it? And herein lies the ongoing issue: Warren insists Trump is going to be Trump, and that she's just got to move forward.
Another document Pence likes to cite is the Constitution. GOP lawmakers recently questioned whether Trump had even read it.
-- Some government employees have still not been paid for working during the shutdown as they brace for the possibility of another. Kimberly Kindy, Lisa Rein and Joel Achenbach report: Thousands of employees [have] experienced delays or anomalies with paychecks at the federal agencies that went dark. Many say they initially received half of what they were owed after working without pay or being furloughed. Others were stunned by what appeared to be excessive tax withholding. And some — the exact number has not been provided by government officials — had received no pay as of Thursday afternoon.
It's a progressive disease, in ever[y] sense of the word, and end stage is particularly devoid of wit and full of venom, tweeted pro-Trump commentator Hugh Hewitt. Pray for the afflicted. Really.
There are a couple of second-tier Republican candidates who have jumped into the race, too, but if Steil is the only name-brand Republican who gets in, Democrats could be the ones with the competitive primary. Bryce is facing local school board member Cathy Myers, who has raised enough money to be taken seriously. Former congressman Peter Barca, who held this seat for two years in the 1990s and now a state representative, is seriously considering getting in the race.
But Cruz certainly has reason to change his tune. He might want to soften his reputation as an obstructionist because he's suddenly becoming the establishment candidate in the GOP race. He'll need some way to explain why D.C. is suddenly endorsing him, plus he might need those folks to win the White House.
-- H.R. McMaster used his last public remarks as national security adviser to denounce Russia and call for more action against Vladimir Putin. Russia has used old and new forms of aggression to undermine our open societies and the foundations of international peace and stability, he said last night at the Atlantic Council. Some nations have looked the other way in the face of these threats. Russia brazenly, and implausibly denies its actions, and we have failed to impose sufficient costs. His comments came just hours after Trump asserted nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, but McMaster argued: We must recognize the need for all of us to do more to respond to and deter Russian aggression. (Ellen Nakashima and John Hudson)
-- Donald Trump recognized all of this intuitively as he ran for office. That's why he repeatedly promised during his campaign, including in his announcement speech, to never undercut Medicaid. I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid, he said in 2015.
And a father at a race car track jumped the barrier to pull his son from a fiery wreck:
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) detailed President Trump's expressions of support from the federal government in the wake of deadly storms that rocked the state
Yet transporting patients to hospitals hasn't always been possible during the pandemic. Some states and localities have ordered ambulances to deliver care in patients' homes — if possible — so as to leave hospital facilities free and available for coronavirus patients.
It is hard to think of two people as different from each other as well-mannered John Roberts and the crude Donald Trump. Yet, in the end, they both believe that courts ought to bend to political will – at least when the chips are down. Donald Trump is what John Roberts told Republicans they needed to find. And they found him.
John D. Dingell Jr., who was the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, was awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2014. (White House)
For instance, next week's CBO report might be able to describe in general terms how the change from CPI-U to CPI-M would save the government money. It is unlikely, though, that CBO will be able to give detailed estimates of how many fewer people Medicaid would be able to cover in the future. (Under the Senate bill, those people would have the opportunity to purchase private insurance in the individual market, with some financial help from the government.)
Treat climate change such as the hoax that Trump has said it is. (In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump seemed to soften that position.) (Trump had not called climate change a hoax since assuming the presidency, although he cast doubt on its severity.)
Throughout the show's open, which has been consistently Trump-themed since the election, Baldwin's Trump brings up Syria, Susan E. Rice and other issues the Kentuckians are uninterested in. The media is saying nice things, and no one is talking about Russia. Wow, what a difference that 59 Tomahawk missiles can make, he says.
If telemedicine is done right, it's really good, quality care, Natoli said. It should be reimbursed, but how do we do that because there's this big barrier in place.
There had been some question about whether the subsidies for laid-off workers could be included in a budget reconciliation bill, which can generally include only things that directly affect federal spending (we wrote about that issue here).

-- Awkward: American Action Network ran a series of ads thanking Republican members of Congress for replacing Obamacare after the bill fell apart. Local ads praised Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) for keeping her promise and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Similar commercials thanked aired to thank Reps. David Young (R-Iowa), David Valadao (R-Calif.) and Will Hurd (R-Tex.). (Samantha Schmidt)
Meanwhile, other data suggests many Trump voters in the Rust Belt would be hurt by the Trump budget's huge cuts to other social programs. Ron Brownstein reports on a new analysis finding that in four key Rust Belt states that flipped from Barack Obama to Trump, large percentages of those who benefit from food stamps and Social Security Disability Insurance — both of which would get slashed by Trump — are non-college whites, a core Trump constituency. Those states are Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Other data shows that large percentages of those who stand to lose health coverage under the GOP health plan in those states are also blue-collar whites. Many of them are likely on Medicaid, and this toll would undoubtedly be made worse by the Trump budget.
Now, for the first time in modern history, a major-party candidate rejects both sides of that equation. If he loses, Donald Trump says, it will be due to cheating that makes the result illegitimate. If he wins, he will imprison his defeated opponent.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who heads the Freedom Caucus, responded to the tweet without any animosity toward the president.
1b. Actually, let's write it in secret, because politics. Except: The bill and the fact we wrote it in secret upset both moderates and conservatives in our party and leave us well shy of 50 out of 52 votes.
-- Ben Terris wrote a fantastic feature from El Paso on Beto O'Rourke's marriage to Amy Hoover Sanders: In truth, even though Amy is fully on board, this isn't the life she would have chosen. ... The first time Beto suggested to Amy that he'd like to run for Congress, she cried. She didn't want him to become some kind of D.C. jerk. The morning after the most recent election, the one he lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R), she cried. ... Whatever post-defeat sadness Amy felt, she was able to kick quickly; she's always been the stable one. Beto, on the other hand, more prone to higher highs and lower lows, was in a 'funk.' In January, Beto hit the road … and drew energy from the people he met, and ... by eating New Mexican dirt said to have regenerative powers. (He brought some home for the family to eat, too.) ...
But in comments to GOP senators in July, President Trump suggested another motivation — that Republicans would look like dopes if they failed to repeal Obamacare. How can we not do this after promising it for years? the president reportedly said.
-- Meanwhile, the GOP-led Senate Appropriations Committee approved a Homeland Security spending bill for 2019 that does not include full border wall funding. Erica Werner reports: The legislation allocates $1.6 billion for border barriers, in line with the original White House request but less than the $2.2 billion the administration later asked for. … The bill also imposes some requirements on the Trump administration related to the current border separation controversy: It requires monthly reports from the administration detailing family separation incidents and requires the administration to make public detention facility inspection reports and reports on detainee deaths. The bill does not provide money to hire new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, or to expand detention bed capacity, despite the president's request for more money for both those things.
What's truly radical, Davis says, is trying to overturn a freaking election.
The more socialist countries of northern Europe abandoned tax rates above 70 percent because they spawned countless schemes for tax avoidance. More significantly, they sapped their economies of their vibrancy and their entrepreneurial spirit. The lesson to take from this failed experiment in confiscatory tax rates is not to punish the rich or unwind the injustices of the marketplace. Rather, the primary purpose of taxation must be to fund necessary government activities and worthwhile programs in a manner that least distorts economic behavior and impinges on economic growth.
Many school districts are also providing meals for children and families that parents can pick up and take home. Check with your local jurisdiction about where and when these programs are available.
AFP has been more hard-hitting, with Facebook ads that plaster a smiling Obama beside pro-expansion delegates. It runs phone banks to call voters, tell them their delegate might shut down the government for Obamacare, then patch them through to the legislator's office.
By 2 a.m. Friday, hundreds of police had begun to regain control, but fires ignited again by noon and the riots intensified. The city's mayor asked for federal troops to move in. … Stores were smashed and looted; hundreds of fires finished the job. Many never reopened. One Secret Service report from April 5 reads, Fire department is leaving the scene of a large fire because being shot at.
Ten years ago, Grassley was at the forefront of GOP opposition to the law, ominously pushing the debunked claim that it would allow the government to pull the plug on grandma by creating death panels.
We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.
The riot left five people dead, including one police officer, and many more wounded. It also touched off a difficult debate over whether government needs new powers to go after the expanding threat of home-grown extremism, amid concerns about civil liberties. Some of the issues got an airing yesterday when FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sister Laura thinks Silverman's natural inclination to think of others is rooted in her childhood and, specifically, her relationship with her mother.
-- Follow the money: The documents turned over by Lev Parnas, Giuliani's former associate, provide details about the web of dark money that helped fund Trump's Ukrainian gambit. From Bloomberg News: Money flowed to Giuliani and his cohorts from home loans, friends, relative strangers and wealthy businessmen, some with interests in the gas and energy sector. It even came from a lawyer for an embattled Ukrainian energy tycoon fighting extradition to the U.S. on a conspiracy charge. … The travel arrangements could brush up against campaign finance laws. While Giuliani [and Parnas] can volunteer as much of their time as they want for a campaign, any subsidy for such work by third parties would generally need to be reported as a contribution, and money from foreign individuals would be illegal.
We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.
Politically, Republicans used their strong opposition to the law to win the majority in the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 — just over a year after the disastrous launch of the government website Healthcare.gov on Oct. 1, 2013.
COLLINS: And you could actually hear some gasps in the chamber when he did so.
-- National security adviser John Bolton is planning to travel to Russia next week, the Kremlin said — a visit that comes amid talks of a possible Trump-Putin summit, which could occur as early as this summer. Politico's Stephanie Murray reports: Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed an Interfax news agency report that Bolton is coming to Moscow, but declined to comment further … 'We have nothing to say yet, and if and when we are ready, we will make the relevant statement,' Peskov said. Trump told reporters last week 'it's possible' he'd meet with the Russian president this summer. A meeting between the two leaders was floated when they spoke by phone in April.
Barr also told Graham that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions probably did the right thing recusing himself from Mueller's probe. It was the answer Graham was looking for.
The author of the report, the Mercatus Center's Charles Blahous, has noted Sanders plan proposes cutting by about 40 percent the payments made by private insurers. But many providers that rely on other forms of insurance, such as Medicaid, would see their reimbursement rates go up under Sanders's plan, or see a significantly smaller cut than the 40 percent decrease on payments from private insurers.
Stephen Colbert mocked Trump's claims of presidential harassment:
Trump's slights come in the form of silence, too. When he gave the commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy in May, he didn't mention McCain, who is one of the academy's most notable alumni.
One example has been frequently cited to support this claim. When the Danish government required concrete manufacturers in the early 1990s to disclose their negotiated prices, prices then rose 15 to 20 percent. Researchers concluded it was easy for companies to raise their prices once they knew what their competitors were charging.
This is a process fueled irresponsibly by base hatred, David Schoen, one of Trump's impeachment lawyers, said on Tuesday, teeing up a video montage of Democrats calling for Trump's removal at various points during his presidency.​ Bruce Castor,​ another member of the defense, ​suggested that those looking to prosecute the president were simply overpowered with emotion where logic does not immediately kick in.
— On the same day lawmakers were talking drug pricing on Capitol Hill, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called for pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of medications, criticizing the companies that once again announced large price increases at the beginning of the year.
In 2004, he launched Wealth TV, a cable channel now known as AWE (A Wealth of Entertainment), featuring shows such as Dream Cruises, Private Islands and Marijuana Miracle Cure. Charles Herring called Wealth TV a vicarious living channel, and the bulk of its fare focuses on luxury travel. But Robert Herring also used his channel as something of a soapbox. In 2004, Wealth TV ran a two-hour special on the right-to-die case of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who had spent half her life in a vegetative state. On the show, Herring offered $1 million to Schiavo's husband if he would halt his effort to remove her from life support. (Schiavo died in 2005 after her feeding tube was removed.)
Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.
When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it. And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.
In other parts of the report, Azar points to efforts to reduce Medicare fraud, approve more generic drugs, implement a biodefense strategy and respond to last year's hurricanes and wildfires. A lengthy appendix entitled HHS By the Numbers claims credit for saving $26 billion on prescription drugs due to generic drug approvals and $12.5 billion in economic burden by reducing regulations.

HOT ON THE LEFT GOP Rep. Rohrabacher on YouTube Shooter: 'Could Be' an 'Illegal Alien,' from the Daily Beast: Appearing on the Fox Business Network to discuss immigration policy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) was asked by host David Asman to pivot to discussing the shooting in San Bruno, California. The congressman's take was to connect the shooting — without a shred of evidence — to the Bay Area's liberal immigration enforcement. 'You were going to talk to me about sanctuary cities and the sanctuary state movement, and it fits right into what you are talking about right now,' Rohrabacher [said]. 'Would anyone be surprised?' The lawmaker blasted the state of California for failing to deal with the scourge of 'criminal illegal aliens.' Rohrabacher then continued: 'Would anyone listening to you right now think, Well, this certainly wouldn't be an illegal immigrant there? Well it could be!' HOT ON THE RIGHT Vanity Fair distances itself from Kurt Eichenwald after journalist launches attack on Parkland student, from the Hill: Vanity Fair distanced itself from journalist Kurt Eichenwald on Tuesday after he called a Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor 'in desperate need of psychiatric help' in a series of emails that were published on Twitter. In emails to conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, Eichenwald described himself as a contributing editor at Vanity Fair — a claim that set off a firestorm of criticism for the magazine … 'Kurt Eichenwald is not a contributing editor at Vanity Fair,' a spokesperson for the magazine [said].
To close the gala, McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell settle in armchairs below the giant Madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as McConnell calls it. At the appeals court level, in particular, Trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (At the district court level, however, Trump's pace lags behind that of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) My goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, McConnell says. The closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. McConnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting Trump elected. The majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: I hope you are proud of what we've done.
Like Scalia, Gorsuch is a proponent of originalism — meaning that judges should attempt to interpret the words of the Constitution as they were understood at the time they were written — and a textualist who considers only the words of the law being reviewed, not legislators' intent or the consequences of the decision.
Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump's tax plan would produce a decline of $9.5 trillion in revenues over a decade, while Cruz's plan would result in a decline of $8.6 trillion in revenues over a decade. That would likely mean massive cuts to government programs that might disproportionately hit lower income earners. We can't know for sure what fiscal agenda the eventual GOP nominee will adopt, but it's likely it will be framed around the idea that the primary problem facing economically struggling Americans is too much government-engineered downward redistribution of wealth. After all, the Gallup numbers above suggest that large swaths of the GOP base are hostile to any further efforts at redistribution.
The $2.2 trillion rescue package known as the Cares Act opened the door for gig workers, freelancers and the self-employed to qualify for unemployment benefits.
— Executives of large health-care systems are asking the Trump administration to modify proposed new rules making it easier for patients to access their own health-care data. Azar has said the rules, which are currently being reviewed by the White House, are intended to enable patients to view their electronic health records at no cost.
None of the vaccines have been approved for use in children, but that could eventually change once trials on kids have been completed. Those efforts are lower priority, considering children only rarely become seriously ill from covid-19, but there will need to be millions more doses available to vaccinate them if the Food and Drug Administration grants approval.
October: Indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are revealed.
His voice choked with emotion, Del. R. Steven Landes (R-Augusta) explained his opposition to expansion, saying it made him sad to vote against the wishes of Cox, Appropriations Committee Chairman Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) and Del. Terry G. Kilgore (R-Scott).
But those reports concerned food, water and baby supplies donated by private entities and nonprofit groups, some of which arrived after the end of a National Guard mission. Those supplies were discovered at a state elections office, but the incident did not involve federal aid. We could locate no reports concerning malfeasance in the use of federal aid money in connection with Hurricane Maria.
The administration won't even defend the ACA in a legal challenge brought by conservative-led states, yesterday adopting an even more dramatic stance against the law.
The system is further convoluted by increasingly common rebates that drug companies pay to PBMs. Critics charge these rebates incentivize PBMs to favor higher-cost drugs or charge insurers more than they're charging the pharmacy — and pocketing the difference.
Brooks-LaSure is now favored for the spot, three of the sources said.
OPERATOR: And I'll turn it back to our presenter's for any additional or closing comments.
Senators and aides in both parties had been eagerly awaiting the release of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's report Monday, which concluded that the bill would save $321 billion over the next decade and leave 22 million more Americans uninsured. By measuring the bill's impact on the federal budget deficit, leaders now have a sense of how much money they have to work with when they consider 11th-hour additions to try to appease the concerns senators have expressed.
The hang-ups: A vote in the Senate doesn't mean a bill will become a law. House Republicans don't seem too interested in voting on something that could save Obamacare, especially when a number of them are still peeved that Obamacare even exists.
SUSAN COLLINS: Lisa Murkowski, who was the third Republican, and I had gone over to talk with John. He had just gotten back. He had found out that he had this devastating diagnosis, and he had been listening to the arguments that we had been making that past week.
Regarding the -- one last thing, I know that the hearing that was previously scheduled for Linda DeVos has been moved to next week. I just want to make sure that everyone understands that she has submitted all that information -- Betsy DeVos, I'm sorry -- all that information and paperwork early -- early on all of those situations (sic), and she looks forward to the Senate confirming her with strong bipartisan support.
He flip-flops on everything, but in the end, he caters to the extreme right, said Dellana, 64. I am a registered Republican, but as this party continues to cater to the extreme right, they push me left.
For too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the Federalist Society, says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. When you actually look at the text and history of the entire Constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the Civil War, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the Federalist Society, would have you believe about our Constitution. The CAC has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. Its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The CAC also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of Congress who claim Trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.
Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?
The result is a Democratic primary debate that is far more liberal on immigration than any previous campaign, fueling dissent over whether the party is downplaying concern about the spiking number of immigrants crossing the border and giving Trump an unneeded boost in key swing states as it tries to animate its left-leaning voters.
As for non-expansion states, the extra money they would ­receive might come through an increase in disproportionate share payments the federal government has long given hospitals that treat a lot of poor patients. Or the government could increase its payments for Medicaid's very poorest patients — a boost to Republican-led states across the South with large low-income populations.
Biden and Harris will virtually tour the State Farm Stadium vaccination site in Glendale, Ariz., this afternoon.
While polls showed voters largely blaming Republicans, the same party won control of the Senate, taking Democratic seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia, and increased its majority in the House to the largest since World War II.
Here's Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has had the herculean task of keeping his disparate Republican Senate majority united to pass coronavirus-aid legislation — not once, but twice — that many of them felt was geared toward Democratic priorities:
The lawsuit that the ACLU filed over the weekend argued, on behalf of people detained upon entry, that the executive order violates their rights to due process and equal protection. It argued that the measure discriminates against them on the basis of their country of origin, and was substantially motivated by animus towards and has a disparate effect on Muslims. The judge who blocked their removal did so out of the belief that those detained and others like them have a strong likelihood of success in showing that their constitutional rights had been violated.
Advocates hailed the Weinstein conviction as a breakthrough.
Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.
That TDS would eventually grace an anti-impeachment brief was, perhaps, just as inevitable.
That point about turnout for Trump's side being great is important. The Trump campaign put a focus on ginning up support in Iowa, dispatching surrogates including Trump's children and his acting White House chief of staff across the state to speak to supporters. Trump-friendly outlets such as the Washington Examiner bit on the story that Trump's team hoped to tell.
KELLY: Will you release the tapes?
Blanchard earns about $100,000 a year and is paying $767 per month for his health plan. It covers insulin, which costs $285 per vial, but covers only part of the cost of his $9,000 insulin pump. He has paid $1,500 out of pocket this year for the pump and supplies.
And $575 billion in spending reductions sounds less sizable when it's put in context. As Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler notes, Medicare spending is projected to grow more than $10 trillion over the decade, so it's essentially a 5 percent reduction in projected spending. The administration says the spending reductions would extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by eight years.
AHH: A Food and Drug Administration official says the administration would consider restricting the sale of menthol-flavored vaping products if its recently announced ban on most e-cigarette pods leads kids to start using menthol products. The ban, which targets disposable pods popular with young people, won't apply to menthol or tobacco flavors.
Regina LaBelle, acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told Bloomberg Law that the Biden administration will endorse needle exchange programs, which provide clean needles to reduce disease transmission. She's also said that the administration may consider fentanyl test strips, which can be used to detect the deadly synthetic opioid in illicit drugs.
Some analysts, including at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, have also raised the concern that allowing interstate insurance sales could prompt a race to the bottom, incentivizing insurers to construct plans in the state with the fewest insurance regulations and then sell those plans around the country. Consumers could end up buying plans that don't comply with regulations where they live and have little ability to appeal decisions if faced with unexpected coverage holes.
The Trump administration wants to add a question to the 2020 Census asking whether respondents are U.S. citizens. Trump claims the census would be meaningless without this all-important question. But numerous experts — including those in the Census Bureau — say that adding a citizenship question would depress response rates by intimidating immigrants fearing potential deportation. (The census is supposed to count all residents, not just citizens.)
It's this difference of approach that highlights the choice Democrats will have to weigh in Saturday's debate, and plays out most strikingly in how the two candidates talk about the economy.
Three of the five highest-polling contenders — Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) — will be spending most of these final days before the caucuses back in Washington in the Senate chamber, doing their constitutional duty as jurors. That leaves the other two, Buttigieg and former vice president Joe Biden, at an advantage. Both are planning to jam their schedules with a lot of quality facetime with Iowa voters.
Yes, but other countries that might have been included on the list are places where Trump has done business, so …
So what about tax reform? Eh, that's not going much of anywhere either. The border tax has thrown a monkey wrench into an already complicated issue. (Even without that complication, the House Republicans have never written and put up for a vote a complete tax plan.) The border-tax idea, driven in large part by the Speaker who used to be the darling of free-market conservatives, will be exceptionally divisive just on the GOP side. Freedom Partners, a Koch brothers group, and many business groups are opposed to the idea. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Nike Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. joined an opposing coalition, warning that border adjustment will cause consumer price increases, the Wall Street Journal reports. Key lawmakers are already raising concerns:
From the Fact Checker: Has Trump talked to the media more than Obama?
President Trump pledges to 'secure' schools on eve of Parkland shooting anniversary:
Besides, should Trump lose, he'll have mounted plenty of other attacks on other fronts by the time defeat rears its ugly head, and he'll probably ignore his defeat or somehow spin it as a victory.
As when Barrett, a retiree who has lived in the Bronx all her life, was explaining her feelings about Trump, for whom she didn't vote. She continued her thought once the train had passed: He says one thing and then he says he never said it and he tries to put it another way.
Another reason Trump's call to getting rid of the filibuster seems shortsighted to those in the Senate: Eventually, perhaps while Trump is president, Republicans will be wishing they had the filibuster.
Harris's staff also pointed to reporting in the Wall Street Journal that because of a potential interaction between federal regulations and the law, employer-provided insurance could be affected, specifically that employers could again impose lifetime limits for catastrophic illnesses. Again, that would affect a relatively small number of people with medical bills over, say, $1 million.
Over the past two days, Trump tweeted a slew of suspect claims on immigration, Obamacare, the census, disaster relief for Puerto Rico and the Russia investigation. Each of them is worth a closer look.
Politicians and health experts say the United States needs to keep as many people on health insurance as possible during the deadly pandemic. But this subsidy issue that Ryan and millions of others are now facing is making that difficult.

When you look at the pay-for on this, people are underestimating the second order, economic benefits of having this money flow through the economy. You would get back hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from the new economic growth, from the trickle-up economy, because people would be spending more and more persistently. You'd also save billions on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency-room health care that we spend tens, hundreds of billions on right now. It was a corrections officer in New Hampshire who said to me, we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they're in jail. We think we're saving money by not investing in people, but we end up spending more in more expensive and punitive ways when they hit our institutions. And the last thing is that if you put this money into our hands, it increases our GDP by $700 billion a year, just by better health and education outcomes. And this is not taking into account the massive catalyst to entrepreneurship, creativity, risk taking, and new businesses and nonprofits that would form if people did not feel like they were going to starve to death if something did not work out.
Building pressures at the border haven't stopped Biden from reversing Trump's policies. On Wednesday the White House dumped a Trump order that shut the door to visa holders and other legal immigrants on the grounds that their arrival would hurt the U.S. labor market under strain from the coronavirus pandemic.
The tech giant announced Google Maps will start displaying drug disposal locations, and people can use searches like drug drop off near me or medication disposal near me, to find permanent drop-off locations at pharmacies, hospitals or government buildings that will safely dispose of the medication.
Barr said he had no involvement in Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein's decision to leave the Justice Department in the coming weeks, saying instead that the No. 2 DOJ official said he sees Barr's confirmation as a natural transition point.
KASICH: Bret, it's very interesting to note, I think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?
The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on drug pricing on Feb. 26.
Asked about the prospect of Maryland's first all-male congressional delegation since ­Mikulski's election in 1986, Van Hollen said he has worked to elect people of all backgrounds and has support from female and African American elected officials.
Warner's Republican colleague Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) reintroduced his own proposal last week. Rather than shut down the government in the absence of a budget, it would institute an across-the-board 1 percent funding cut for all agencies and would cut another 1 percent every 90 days that no agreement is reached.
I think he made a severe error in saying what he did about Mexican Americans, Romney says.
Global companies do not invest in countries with autocratic leaders who arbitrarily impose economic sanctions or punitive tariffs on longtime allies who fail to perform political favors or take a different approach to unrelated foreign policy issues.
That's especially clear on the subject of entitlement programs such as Medicare. At the time of Ryan's greatest strength, Trump is turning the party against the very change that Ryan sought power to achieve.
Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting. Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion. And I think being off the record is a very important thing. I think it's a very, very powerful thing.
Get ready. Congress faces a jam-packed to-do list this month with deadlines looming on a government shutdown and a number of big, outstanding health-care policies -- the fate of two marketplace stabilization bills and long-term funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which lawmakers have essentially punted until the end of March.
Bigger Tent GOP?: There's one Republican who is taking his sweet time in deciding whether to challenge Trump in a high-stakes 2020 primary. My colleagues Robert Costa and Erin Cox interviewed Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has signaled that if he does run an insurgent campaign for the GOP nomination he would pitch himself as far more in tune with the party's long-held values and worldview than Trump.

Biden's son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in 2015. The then-vice president was in charge of the Obama administration's Cancer Moonshot initiative launched in 2016.
In a back-and-forth with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Barr threw cold water on the notion that Mueller's report might be made public.
-- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the bill that's been postponed until next week. They talk, and sometimes you all repeat it, that it's a compromise, the California Democrat said at a news conference. But it is not a compromise! It may be a compromise with the devil, but it's not a compromise with the Democrats.
Rodney Whitlock, former health policy staffer for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa):
5. What limits will Democrats face?
Pelosi, in the meantime, doesn't appear interested in changing her strategy. In a recent Washington Post interview, she spoke at length about how she doesn't think her caucus is any more liberal than it was before the 2018 election, despite the influx of lawmakers such as Ocasio-Cortez and Omar.
-- Notable commentary from The Post's opinion page:
She's not on the Ways and Means Committee or on Energy and Commerce, the House's two top health-care panels. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has appointed Shalala to the Rules Committee, a perch allowing her to showcase her deep policy knowledge. Last month Shalala managed debate on a bill that would have required the House's chief lawyer to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit from GOP-led states.
First, Biden, unlike Trump, understands that a president must model good behavior. In his ABC interview, he said he would be willing to wear a mask in public, something Trump announced he would not do, undercutting the recommendation of experts. I think it's important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you, Biden said. He may not like how he looks in a mask, but the truth of the matter is that — follow the science. That's what they're telling us. A president, you see, puts vanity aside, supports his own scientists and understands that the country takes its cues from the president.
These 134 passengers boarded a Boeing 767 on March 23 for an eight-hour flight with the sole purpose of getting an up-close look at the Aurora Australis, also known as the Southern Lights. (The Washington Post)
-- Big-money groups aligned with the Senate GOP raised $68.3 million in 2019, an off-year record. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: The majority of the money raised in 2019 came in the latter half of the year, particularly in the final two months, largely driven by the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
Most Americans say employers should provide workers with paid family leave, although there are sharp divides when people are asked whether it should be a requirement. In a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center, 51 percent of respondents said the federal government should mandate that employers provide paid leave, while 48 percent said it shouldn't.
A senior Senate GOP aide said Monday that the provision was an inadvertent error that arose because the drafting process was pretty quick. The staffer, who asked for anonymity because the bill was still being finalized, said the section would be rewritten to clarify the funds could be used only within Medicaid.
Andrew Boyle, a counsel with the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told us he hopes the next big push in Congress will be to overhaul the National Emergencies Act that has enabled Trump to act to begin with.
And then, of course, Coons continued, Tonight is the vote-a-rama.
I think it's madness, Baron Cohen says. I saw that show and I thought, she's fantastic. She's incredibly outspoken, incredibly intelligent and amazingly funny. So it seems bizarre that she's not fronting a show that is primarily political.
Antiabortion advocates have been pleased with the Trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.
Cruz took a good first step last night, both in laying out an argument for long-term optimism and refusing to endorse Trump. He can set a standard of integrity in refusing to accept an unacceptable candidate. In fact, he would do well to encourage the #NeverTrump movement, which as he exits the race remains very much alive. Trump is an existential threat to not merely the Republican Party but the republic, a veteran Republican operative told me. If the Republican Party has to be sacrificed to protect the country from an unhinged demagogue then so be it. Cruz's reputation would be enhanced by his association with the effort — unlike quislings like Bobby Jindal, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and others who seem as though they will support Trump whatever he says or does.
Working behind the scenes with the veterans' group, he drafted new legislation limiting the honor to federal employees killed in a crime, an act of terrorism, a natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstance.
It's a mess. And we're hurting. And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done, all the steps, Buttigieg said. It didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes, I have to face the fact.
That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.
Allow concealed-carry permits to be recognized in all 50 states. (See above.)
Suggesting that a candidate, president-elect and president can say whatever they want and it has no consequences — that is a novel understanding of the impact of a head of state making public pronouncements, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.).
The National Governors Association echoed this point in a bipartisan letter to McConnell on Monday, signed by NGA Chairman Terry McAuliffe (D) of Virginia and its vice chairman for health and human services, Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts.
— The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit won't reconsider a ruling from a three-judge panel that last month ruled the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate unconstitutional.
I don't settle cases. I don't do it. (Even after this comment but before he became president, Trump University settled. And since then, his organizations have settled some more.)
TRUMP: We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.
But Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) challenged Holtz-Eakin's remarks, saying she wanted to disagree that 340B is the primary reason for higher prices. There's a whole lot of other reasons and that is not the primary reason.
Silvershow set a similar tone. Silverman filmed the HBO pilot early last year on a bare-bones set. It opens with a monologue and gives way to a video spoof about censorship of women's nipples set to Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire. Silverman then leads a lively discussion about the ills of social media with Sacha Baron Cohen and journalist Sheera Frenkel.
Several business associations in Nevada have started offering association health plans to member companies. Enrollees in the plan offered by the Reno-Sparks Chamber of Commerce have cited lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.
What they report doesn't match up against what our members tell us, Gallucci said. He said he is worried that CVA's agenda would hurt veterans.
After he lost his congressional seat, partly because of his support for Obamacare, Perriello had prominent roles at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. His friendship with Obama led to appointments in the State Department, including a diplomatic posting in Africa.
Oh, great, just great, Trump reportedly said, adding that they would like to see an expansion of the H-1B visa program, which allows employers to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialty occupations.
He winds his way through a stump speech with the same inflections and cadences of a Southern preacher. The call-and-response includes melodic repetition of the line Who are we? imploring the audience to answer We, the people. Resting one arm against the lectern while looking off to the side, he delivers rehearsed dad jokes, pleas for voter turnout and broadsides against his political opponent. The preacher sprinkles his calls for affordable health care with biblical allusions, reminding voters that Bartimaeus, a blind man healed by Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, suffered from a preexisting condition. To this point, Warnock testifies on the need for Medicaid expansion and cheaper college tuition. Audience members punctuate the applause lines with cries of C'mon, Rev!
This deepening rejection of Trump — and embrace of Obama — was not well received by many of Trump's most vocal supporters, Eugene writes. Criticism of McCain has abounded on social media, with Trump defenders calling him a Democrat and an 'embarrassment to our country,' and attacking his character in other ways.
Even before concerns about a global pandemic, voters were saying that, once again, health care would be their top issue in the coming election. If these developments weren't enough to convince voters they can't trust Republicans on health care, perhaps some news that broke Monday will: The Supreme Court said it would hear another case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he would cut the chamber's August recess in half, saying the GOP needed more time to achieve its legislative goals given the protracted negotiations over health-care legislation and continued opposition from Democrats on several fronts.
But he was more forthright in seeming to lay the blame on the members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right bloc that was a crucial factor in the health-care bill's demise.
In an interview with Rush Limbaugh on Monday, Vice President Pence endorsed the Cruz amendment and the idea that lawmakers should repeal the ACA outright if they cannot devise an immediate substitute.
The same approach should govern aid to schools. The bill currently includes $170 billion for K-12 schools and higher education, purportedly to enact measures that would enable distance learning or an earlier return to in-person instruction. Nearly $60 billion in previously enacted aid for schools remains unspent, however. Additional funds should not be given until schools or universities have used their previously allocated money, and they should also be predicated on return to 100 percent in-person instruction.
Analysts say his impeachment strategy is just more evidence that he is playing to win.
I think you kind of settle in for a roller-coaster with this president, said Joel Ario, who directed the insurance marketplaces in the Obama administration. Each time you think he's going to support it, he undercuts it. It's the back and forth that makes the insurers little less aggressive.
* INFRASTRUCTURE 'PLAN' IS IN THE WORKS: The Post reports:
The breakthrough transplant brings hope to the medical community that it could help change HIV perceptions and lead to an expanded pool of available organs, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.
Last week, the EPA moved to finalize a rule to weaken the federal government's gas mileage standards, rolling back Obama's most significant effort to combat climate change — a longtime goal for Trump. The move, which dramatically scales back requirements for fuel efficiency improvements, came on the same day that Trump warned Americans to brace for a very, very painful two weeks, and ultimately for as many as 240,000 coronavirus deaths.

Murray suggested GOP women in the Senate could play a key role in fending off the defunding measure:I know that Republican women here don't want their party to be known as the party that takes away a woman's ability to make her own health care choices.
Trump's tax cuts are estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office expects they will spur net economic growth at the same time that they ramp up the federal debt.
Under former President Barack Obama's administration, the IRS had processed tax returns even if filers failed to answer the required questions about whether they had health coverage. The agency had planned to start rejecting such returns in 2017, but reverted back to the original policy shortly after Trump took office.
But he also said he thinks health care is a right. I think every American should have access to good affordable health care, he said.
Accomplish more immigration reforms in a few months than politicians have accomplished in the past 50 years. With these reforms, Trump promised: Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear and welfare use will decrease. (Trump accomplished no significant immigration reform, beyond executive orders. Gangs still exist, and violent crime is about the same level as when Trump took over.)
The news also sparked speculation of a potential political run by Richards, whose mother Ann Richards served as Democratic governor of Texas from 1991 to 1995. She's someone we have partnered with very happily, billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer told Dave. If she stops, I hope it's because she's doing something new and important. If she ran for any office, I'd support her.
At this stage in the Democratic contest, Yang has become a modern campaign archetype: the candidate for people who hate politicians and who don't trust news unless they get it online. The voters showing up to his events say they discovered him not through mainstream media but through podcasters such as Joe Rogan and Sam Harris, who have built followings as leaders of the intellectual dark web that asks whether political correctness has suppressed the truth about topics such as race and identity. Many say they had not bothered to vote in recent elections; those who say they did vote backed outsiders such as Ron Paul or Bernie Sanders.
At the end of 2015, Cruz was ranked one of the least bipartisan senators in recent decades by the nonpartisan Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.
Knox: Should President Biden have taken a harder line on Mohammed bin Salman, after the report finding he approved the operation to kill Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi?
More than a dozen states and cities and a range of groups sued in 2018 to block the question, calling it a ruse by the Trump administration to weaken the political power of heavily Democratic states with large immigrant populations. Census data is used to allocate federal funds, draw legislative districts and reapportion congressional seats.
To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
Now, to your question, how do we actually move things in that direction? This is where, first, your tax system comes in. So right now, we have a relatively crude way to reward charitable contributions, which is we say, Hey, they're tax deductible. For most businesses, this is helpful. But just about anything they spend money on is tax deductible because it's going to reduce their earnings by a certain amount. So we need to do more to say, look, if you can actually discernibly improve, let's say, graduation rates in a particular town or area or physical wellness of, let's call it hundreds and thousands of employees, then not only do you get a tax break for having put money into that, but you might even get something positive in addition, for the fact that you actually have improved our society's measurements on the things that we care about.
And conservative groups warned they might not support a Senate bill if it doesn't repeal enough of the ACA:
Not all people eligible for welfare collect benefits. When they do, many of the benefits are contingent on the recipients working or actively searching for jobs, as a result of an overhaul of welfare signed into law by Clinton in 1996. And even low-income families receive some level of public assistance.
But when it comes to these new association health plans, they appear — at least so far — to offer benefits comparable to most workplace plans and haven't tried to discriminate against patients with preexisting conditions, according to an analysis released today by Kev Coleman, a former analyst at the insurance information website HealthPocket.
The new enrollment opportunity will run from next week through May 15. If Congress adopts the increased subsidies for monthly premiums during that time, the change would kind of supercharge the new enrollment period, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-policy research group. Levitt has suggested previously that the new enrollment period was a very partial step and predicted that it might not attract many customers because the health plans were not affordable to everyone eligible for them.
Some activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.
Under the plan they introduced Tuesday, the state would notify uninsured residents starting in 2020 that they will be charged a fee to help them obtain coverage through the state's health-care exchange. Residents would also have the option of paying the penalty and receiving nothing in return.
The agency held a hearing Tuesday on testing for asbestos in talc, which is the first time the issue has been considered since 1971. The meeting was focused on recommended testing standards.
— Meanwhile, three dozen Democratic lawmakers sent a letter urging the Trump administration to reverse course on its block grant plan.
As our colleague Amy Goldstein reported, Azar's remarks were consistent with the administration's portrayal of middle men, not the pharmaceutical industry itself, as the root of the nation's high drug prices. He reiterated that direct government negotiation of drug prices in the vast Medicare program — a longtime Democratic goal that Trump embraced during his campaign — would be ineffective.
McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks told The Post the GOP leader has been clear-eyed on what went wrong last cycle and no one is more committed to doing everything necessary to win back the House and execute an agenda that offers every American limitless potential to get ahead.
Democrats protest closed-door efforts to draft an Obamacare replacement:
The group reported receiving $553 million in government funding in 2014, about half of its total revenue. Congress has barred federal funding for abortions since 1976, but health providers that offer abortions are eligible to use federal funds for other services.
It would make our jobs a lot easier, if these were the days when a vast majority of the American audience tuned into Walter Cronkite at night and we could just talk to 'Uncle Walter' and get our message out there, and that's just not the case anymore, Obama press secretary Jay Carney said in April 2011.
More than 54 percent of South Dakota voters supported a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana in November, but on Monday a circuit court judge ruled the change was unconstitutional, Teo Armus reports.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: Robert Draper interviewed Trump for a cover story in next week's New York Times magazine: When I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn't hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump's reply was immediate. I think you're right, he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. We're also going to prime the pump, he said. You know what I mean by 'prime the pump'? In order to get (the economy) 'going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that'll be going, we're going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that'll happen.' A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama.
Trump asked Roger Ailes to lead the campaign, and Ailes declined
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday that the sums requested by several of his top public health officials to accomplish this goal will be in the president's budget next month. He, too, did not specify an amount.
The former Eli Lilly executive called out drugmakers who began the year announcing drug price hikes, and also blasted pharmacy benefit managers — a frequent target of the administration's ire — who could benefit from rising costs. In a Fox Business Network interview on Wednesday, Azar also said he and the president were meeting about our plans to bring down drug prices, and I want to be really clear to PhRMA companies out there and to the pharmacy benefit managers, the president and I will not stop until list prices of drugs come down.
McConnell opposed, unsuccessfully, the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement but helped lay the basis for President Trump's withdrawal from his predecessor's Iran deal and the Paris climate agreement. Three major trade deals have cleared the Senate under his watch in recent years and, of course, the Trump tax cuts. The majority leader has held his often-riven caucus together with the support of wily veterans such as Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and the now-retired Orrin Hatch (Utah), as well as centrists including Rob Portman (Ohio) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.). He has found elbow room for brilliant newcomers such as Ted Cruz (Tex.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Tim Scott (S.C.) and Tom Cotton, a shared favorite of both McConnell and Trump. Cotton's home state of Arkansas is, like McConnell's, seen as flyover country, so the leader's appreciation for another Southern gentleman with smarts is no surprise.
On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) chastised the administration for targeting the law while health officials throughout the United States race to contain the spread of a highly infectious respiratory disease that has caused more than 3,000 deaths globally.
Ain't no way I would ever support Obamacare or sign up for it. I would rather die. Trevor tells Metzl in the book before explaining why. We don't need any more government in our lives. And in any case, no way I want my tax dollars paying for Mexicans or welfare queens.
One of Navalny's associates tweeted that he was told he could face charges of extremism for broadcasting the rally. If that is the case, a lot of people are going to be in trouble: Thousands of iPhones recorded as police closed off central Moscow's Pushkin Square, lined major streets and hauled anyone carrying signs into large buses. By Sunday evening, riot police in body armor and helmets had hauled in more than 700 demonstrators in central Moscow, as the crowd, numbering in the tens of thousands, cheered, whistled and chanted, 'Shame! Shame!'
The discrepancy is partly due to many unemployed Americans being misclassified as employed, Powell Powell said during a virtual speech at the Economic Club of New York.
— And here are a few more good reads:
— A new survey from Gallup found Americans rank nurses highest among a list of professions for honesty and ethics. Eighty-five percent of Americans say nurses have high or very high levels of these attributes.
Under fire for a sluggish response, Trump started to target the Obama administration, especially its handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. But it's false to say Obama didn't do anything about it. In fact, Obama's handling was widely praised at the time as the right mix of action and no overreaction.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: They're all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They don't know what the hell they're doing. ... They can't even count their votes, Trump said of the Democratic candidates during his rally in Manchester. (Robert Costa, Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey)
Part of it is self-imposed, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said of Trump's challenges and political drift, adding that many key players often find it difficult to build a bond with the 70-year-old executive. People know him, they see him at meetings, but it's been hard for people in Congress and around it to get to know him in a way that's helpful for Trump.
But there is often gain for members.
Am I eligible for unemployment insurance?
But perhaps the commentary that will draw the most questions Tuesday is a 19-page memo that is highly critical of Mueller pursuing an obstruction case. Among other views, Barr wrote that Mueller's apparent theory of obstruction was fatally misconceived and he should not be permitted to demand that the President submit to interrogation about alleged obstruction.
Meanwhile, a 2010 investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, based on documents from the four largest for-profit health insurers, found that companies denied coverage to one out of every seven applicants. So that would be 14 percent. So even if you took the entire U.S. population with health insurance — about 257 million people — that means 34 million would face a denial of coverage. Within the individual market — assuming every state sought a waiver — the result would be 2.5 million, assuming they all experienced a lapse in coverage of more than two months.
Over the next two years, the Democratic-led House is likely to pass more legislation along these lines, sending bills over to the Senate where they'll probably stall because of GOP opposition. Yet Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, issued an optimistic statement yesterday.
— Makers of car seats for children have marketed their products as safe despite their own testing that showed children could be in grave danger if they were in a crash, ProPublica reports.
Centene and Molina, which are heavily involved in Medicaid, would make up five percent of the index. But Medicaid beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums. Medicaid companies are paid by federal and state governments directly, so they are not relevant to the discussion of the impact of eliminating cost-sharing reductions.
Heller said he is particularly worried about making sure that states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA can continue to provide insurance to low-income Americans. He said the current bill would cap Medicaid payments at a growth rate that won't keep up with the true cost of medical care and could force states to spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to keep people insured.
Now Trump is in the White House, and Nadler has changed his tune, the president suggests.
Today, the president (sic) began his day receiving the PDB here in New York. He will then meet with Ainsley Earhardt of Fox & Friends for an interview that will air later. He will meet with Judge Andrew Napolitano and then he will meet with the CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, and his first name is D-E-N-N-I-S, last name M-U- I-L-E-N-B-U-R-G. Then he will meet with Sheri Dillon, S-H-R-I (sic) D-I-L-L-I-O-N, his attorney who many of you recall, who spoke at the press conference last week. And after that, he will sit down with Mike Allen of the new site Axios.

-- Tightening the screws: The first prison sentence was handed down yesterday as the result of Mueller's investigation. London-based lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, 33, will serve 30 days in prison after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts in September and October of 2016 with a business associate of one-time Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and with Manafort's deputy, former Trump aide Rick Gates. Prosecutors said van der Zwaan also destroyed emails the special counsel had requested, Spencer S. Hsu reports.

CRUZ: Donald, learn not to interrupt. It's not complicated.
Nevertheless, he signed up for his state's expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. He begrudgingly submitted to a physical and got a nasty shock: He had early-stage colon cancer. Surgery followed.
The guide suggests some policies Republicans would almost certainly balk at, such as allowing the government to negotiate lower prices for Medicare drugs and rolling back the administration's expansion of leaner coverage options.
A few business leaders are coming around to the idea that they might be able to strike deals with Clinton, much as they did with her husband in the 1990s.
And that 2017 effort failed miserably.
The plaintiffs, who hope to battle with the companies in as many jurisdictions as they can, called the order a significant step forward for the litigation.
After the election, former leaders of CVA and other Koch officials secured key posts inside the administration. In one pivotal appointment, Darin Selnick, a former senior CVA adviser, was tapped to be the administration's most influential voice on veterans policy and serve as the White House's veterans affairs adviser.
SPICER: Thank you for the question.
Health 202: Do you think there's going to be bipartisan work on health policy in the next two years?

BAIER: We are here in Detroit. The top issues in Michigan, according to Facebook, are displayed in a word cloud you're taking a look at. The second biggest issue is clean water. That, of course, is directly tied with the situation in Flint.
Like Collins and Flake, Paul received almost nothing by caving on Pompeo, despite having had maximum leverage. He didn't get promised legislation or even a seat at negotiations: He just got assurances that Trump and Pompeo oppose further U.S. military interventions. And if you believe for a second that either Pompeo (a committed warmonger) or Trump (a committed liar) means to keep his word, or that Paul believes they will, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you.
OUCH: While Washington state's worst measles outbreak in two decades continues, hundreds of people packed into a public hearing about a bill to make it more difficult for families to opt out of vaccination requirements for measles, mumps and rubella.
Urge assimilation because our system of government, and our American culture, is the best in the world and will produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. (Trump didn't mention assimilation or assimilate once after he became president, per Factbase.)
So the 52-year-old computer programmer panicked a few years ago when his company downsized and he was let go.
I don't think it's something we decide whether or not it's 'worth it,'  House Progressive Caucus co-chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told them . If [our investigations show] a consistent pattern of abuse of power, of obstruction of justice . . . then that to me seems like it will be impeachable.
It's a 150-page bill … it's not an eight-page resolution, Jayapal told Paige about the measure, insisting she's confident she'll have 100 cosponsors by a planned Feb. 26 release. Now we're actually putting detail into it, and so we feel confident we will continue to add cosponsors even after introduction.
A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. To me, Joshua recalls, the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.
If problems continue, it could leave people even less able to pay bills or buy groceries and further exacerbate the economic decline. Politically, it could be highly damaging to Trump, who is continuing to belittle his predecessor's record of managing complex government operations.
-- The increasing trade tensions could pose a political risk for the GOP. Michael Scherer writes: Republicans have a new reason to worry as they struggle to hold their House majority in November's midterm elections: The price in China of U.S. sweet cherries, raw almonds and frozen pig forelegs. President Trump's emerging trade war with China is already shaking up U.S. politics, threatening local economies in parts of Washington state, California and Iowa and putting Republican seats in jeopardy. … Democratic candidates have blamed Republicans for the growing trade dispute's impact on local farmers, and Republican leaders have been publicly pleading with Trump to pull back from the brinkmanship.
But groups that represent people with serious illnesses warned that those Americans could face grave health consequences if they have to wait for a plan to kick in before seeking costly treatments.
-- The top U.S. commander in the Middle East said the recent troop surge there may not end soon, despite what the president said. You're here because I requested that you come, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told sailors and Marines aboard the USS Bataan amphibious assault ship. I'm not sure how long you're going to stay in the theater. We'll work that out as we go ahead. Could be quite a while, could be less than that, just don't know right now. (AP)
If I was ever asked to do something that I thought was unlawful and directed to do that, I wouldn't do it, and I would resign rather than do it, Barr said. But I think that should be true of every officer who serves anywhere in the government, whatever branch.
Senators just as conservative as Ryan realized they could not win a primary while being critics of Trump. So, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) decided to retire, and to use his last days in Congress to compare Trump to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and his own party to Stalin's enablers. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) compared Trump to a toddler, then announced his retirement.
Frankly, the anticipation is not that this package is going to get to the president's desk and signed into law, Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations at Families USA, told me. This is about Democrats fulfilling their promise to the American people.
Announcing his plans to retire at the end of the year, Ryan said Wednesday that his signature achievements will stand as the GOP's new $1.4 trillion tax cut law and an increase in military spending that came as part of last month's $1.3 trillion government-wide spending bill signed by a reluctant President Trump.
-- In many parts of Afghanistan, the Taliban has built a sophisticated system of parallel governance, according to a detailed new report finding that numerous insurgent-controlled districts have commissions for health, justice and finance. Pamela Constable reports: In many areas, the report finds, Taliban representatives interact almost routinely with local government officials, aid agencies and other groups, negotiating terms in a hybrid system to deliver health care, education and other services. Taliban bureaucrats collect taxes and electric bills, and their judges hear civil and criminal cases — some traveling by motorbike between hearings. The main conclusions of the report … are that the Taliban sets the rules in 'vast swaths' of Afghan territory but is far more concerned with influencing people.
Black babies had a mortality rate in 2018 of 10.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to a rate of 4.6 White babies per 1,000 live births. The researchers say that more research is needed to understand the disparity in outcomes, but it may underscore the importance of combatting implicit bias in medical practice.
How they navigate those ­pressures will largely shape what, if any, bill comes out of the upper chamber of Congress.

But while Manchin has the excuse of coming from one of the reddest states in the country, Sinema comes from a state that voted (albeit narrowly) for President Biden. And relative to the lean of her state, her voting record was more pro-Trump than any of her Democratic colleagues, per FiveThirtyEights data. If you're a Democrat, it's easier to argue she should be with your side than Manchin. And as many have pointed out, her fellow Arizona senator, Mark Kelly (D), is the one up for reelection in 2022, and he voted in favor of including the minimum wage in the bill.
The National Institutes of Health is scheduled to hold a meeting of the National Advisory Mental Health Council on Thursday.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she is not planning to retire: As long as I can do the job full steam, I will be here:

The programs have been financed with federal funds since the ACA was passed in 2010. Under the law, the federal government is charged with paying 95 percent of the funds it would have directed toward subsidies for those needing help with insurance premiums -- as well as toward the cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) the government promised insurance companies for offering lower-price plans through the individual marketplace.
Gov. Steve Bullock is expected to run for Senate in Montana.
Josh Peck, co-founder of Get America Covered, questioned what additional circumstances would justify letting taxpayers off the hook for not buying insurance. He said that while he was working at CMS under former President Obama, the agency had thoroughly explored the broad sweep of possible exemptions.
FDA's new strategy for adapting drugs, tests and vaccines for the variants is a cornerstone of the administration's battle plan, drawn in part from years of experience fighting the fast-mutating flu virus, Politico's Sarah Owermohle and David Lim report. Meanwhile, officials at the National Institutes of Health — the sprawling scientific campus where Anthony Fauci leads infectious-disease research — are working with at least two vaccine manufacturers, including Moderna, to start human trials next month of variant-targeting vaccines.
As CMS released the enrollment totals yesterday, the agency also announced it will grant an additional year before certain grandmothered health plans that still don't fully comply with ACA regulations must fall in line. The move is similar in nature to previous moves by the administration expanding leaner, cheaper health plans through short-term coverage and associations plans.
He's been able to count on this group to be the reliable faction, the ones who will take tough votes and won't complain publicly about doing it. But that has changed as a growing number of lawmakers get desperate about their own election chances. They want to be seen taking action to protect dreamers before they face voters in districts that Democrats will target this November. At least four signatories are retiring, suggesting that when they have the freedom to speak their mind, they would rather buck Ryan on this.
In early 2003, at the start of the Iraq War — not just after it became apparent to nearly everyone that it was a catastrophe — Gallup found 68 percent of African Americans opposed the conflict.
Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.
Meanwhile, on the Hill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been forced to play damage control to keep progressive members — particularly freshmen — in line, they write. On the policy front, particularly on health care, Pelosi is focusing the caucus's attention on improving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which was her chief legislative accomplishment during her first term as speaker.
In a 43-page ruling, U .S. District Judge John D. Bates of the District of Columbia blocked the rules overseeing the alternative plans, which allow small businesses to join forces to offer less expensive plans that don't comply with all the ACA requirements on individual market plans, as our colleague Timothy Bella writes.
At a news conference in the state capitol in Little Rock, Hutchinson said that to comply with the judge's ruling, Arkansas had immediately closed the online portal for people to report their work hours — and would not remove anyone else from the program, though it had been preparing to announce a new round of cut-offs within a few weeks, she adds. But he emphasized, 'I remain fully committed to a work requirement, and we are in this for the long haul because we believe it is the right policy.'

-- Biden wouldn't say whether he thinks Sanders could unify the party if he wins the nomination. From the AP: 'We have to unite,' Biden told reporters in Muscatine, six days before the Iowa caucuses. 'I'm not going make judgments now. I just think that it depends upon how we treat one another between now and the time we have a nominee.' Biden has previously promised to support the Democratic nominee, regardless of who it is. … The Biden campaign said Tuesday afternoon that the former vice president would support the eventual nominee.
New Biden rules for ICE could lead to fewer arrests and deportations, and a more restrained agency, Miroff and Maria Sachetti report .

Beto O'Rourke carried on his campaign trip to Pennsylvania:
Trump will do whatever makes him more popular with his base, and he doesn't seem to care what the feasibility of it is as long as it resonates, for the moment, with his base, she said.
Trump is rewriting history. Just eight days earlier he had tweeted, So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! By the time he made the statement at the news conference, the number of confirmed cases had risen to nearly 6,000, with almost 100 deaths.
The court's decision, if affirmed, will deprive millions of non-elderly Ohioans and Montanans of coverage for preexisting conditions, the pair wrote. It will also negatively affect countless others who organized their affairs in reliance on the Act's many unrelated provisions.
A Post video reporter mocked O'Rourke's tendency to stand on coffee counters:
Does this tell us anything us about 2017's congressional politics? It might be that elected officials are simply less likely than non-politicians to back away from a course of action that they have already invested time and resources in, even if additional information emerges that should give them pause.
John Fredericks, a conservative radio host who was chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign, echoed Cox's appeal to Trump supporters in The Bull Elephant, a conservative blog.
In all, 37 states have now expanded Medicaid — many of them red — while 14 have not. It's true that a handful of the biggest states — such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina — still have not expanded Medicaid, and that's a big obstacle to progress.
But what looks like consistency from one angle comes across as a dangerous rigidity from another. Instead of listening to critics and adjusting his plans to better reflect expert analysis, or talking more forthrightly about their costs, Sanders has doubled down. And while Sanders's legislative program would never pass Congress, he would bring all of his ideological inflexibility and incuriosity to the hundreds of decisions he would have to make daily in the White House, and to staffing his administration.

The opposition also came from the middle. A group of four Senate Republicans quickly drew a line in the sand, telling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that they would oppose any bill that reduced the insurance rate. (That's a likely outcome of the new bill, given it swaps out the individual mandate — a penalty for not having health care coverage — for a surcharge on those going more than two months without coverage. This would ostensibly allow those who would prefer not to pay for coverage to simply avoid it.

To beat President Trump, Democrats must do three things: First, they must energize African American voters who turned out for Barack Obama but failed to do so for Hillary Clinton. Second, they must win back blue-collar Democrats who voted twice for Obama but switched to Trump in 2016. And third, they must hold onto the votes of suburban women who defected from the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections.

Moreover, since Congress last tried to undo the ACA, two more states — Maine and Virginia — have adopted the Medicaid expansion, enlarging the ACA's constituency.
-- And while Trump wants to grant NASA a multibillion-dollar boost to put astronauts back on the moon, his budget would cut funding for other science and health agencies. The Health and Human Services agency would suffer a nearly 10 percent cut, while the Environmental Protection Agency would lose 26 percent of its funding – the administration is hoping to eliminate nearly 50 EPA programs. The Energy Department would get a boost in funding for safeguarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, but outside of that program it would see a 28.7 percent cut.

-- Trump will sign the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement during a ceremony at the White House today for about 400 guests, but he chose not to invite any of the key Democrats who shepherded the deal through Congress. Guests invited to the South Lawn signing include lawmakers from around the country, workers, farmers, and CEOs, as well as officials from Mexico and Canada, Reuters reports. Not invited were House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal and other Democrats who negotiated for months to expand the pact's labor, environmental and enforcement provisions and ensure the approval of the Democratically-controlled House.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But not a leader.
Roberts's captivity is entirely fitting: He is forced to witness, with his own eyes, the mess he and his colleagues on the Supreme Court have made of the U.S. political system. As representatives of all three branches of government attend this unhappy family reunion, the living consequences of the Roberts Court's decisions, and their corrosive effect on democracy, are plain to see.

Silver-loading evolved when the administration halted extra payments to Obamacare marketplace insurers to cover cost-sharing discounts they must offer the lowest-income shoppers. By loading all of the funding loss onto mid-level silver premiums, on which subsidy levels are based, insurers were able to help consumers get larger subsidies they could then also apply to gold or bronze-level plans.
Fourth, impeachment has put moderate House Democrats in grave peril. A New York Times/Sienna College poll recently found that almost two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, but then voted for House Democrats in 2018, plan to back Trump again in 2020. That's bad news for the 31 House Democrats elected in Trump districts in the midterms. How many people are going to vote to give Trump a second term and vote for the Democrats who tried to take away their right to do so? Not many.
What have the Republicans got? Nothing except a desire to obliterate all of the ACA. If they whine that the Democrats' plan is too expensive, Democrats (after guffawing at the nerve of the party that rang up the biggest deficits in history) are likely to suggest clawing back some of the tax cuts for the rich, which were so unpopular Republicans could not run on their handiwork in 2018.
But in 1974's Milliken v. Bradley, the court overturned that ruling, again by a 5-to-4 vote, and held that if a state's schools were segregated because whites and blacks lived in different districts, courts were powerless to act. The class lines in the suit were not straightforward — much of the opposition to busing came from working-class whites — but the effect was to lock many poor blacks in segregated, failing urban schools.

The governor and I have been friends since the first day I got here in 2011, Stanley said. His office, when he was a senator, was right across the hall from mine. And I just took a liking to him immediately. And he had no choice but to like me back.
I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.
They're a political lobbying firm, said Louis Celli, national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation for the American Legion, the country's largest veterans group. They're not a veterans organization. They're using veterans issues as a tool to push a political agenda.
Andrew Yang: Of course, the government should be enacting those policies at every turn.
Joe is going to have to explain to the people, the union workers in the Midwest, why he's supported disastrous trade agreements, Sanders said. Joe is going to have to explain to the American people why he voted for a Wall Street bailout, something that I vigorously opposed. Sanders added that Joe is also going to have to explain his vote to authorize the Iraq War, a disastrous bankruptcy bill which benefited the credit card companies and his onetime advocacy for freezing Social Security benefits.
OFA is a nonprofit group dedicated to grass-roots organizing, which is exactly what we've been doing since 2013, said communications director Jesse Lehrich. We have volunteer-led chapters around the country who are working to engage their friends and neighbors to enact positive change in their communities. These conspiracy theories swirling through the conservative media-verse aren't just perplexing, they're dangerous.
Tammy Duckworth celebrated St. Patrick's Day a bit early:
At a town hall a few weeks later, she challenged the GOP incumbent, Steve Knight, to explain how he would vote on the ACA repeal legislation. He declined to talk about the hypothetical bill, only to vote for it not long thereafter.
So actually, let me continue for a second.
OUCH: Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox (R) said he expects Medicaid expansion to proceed as planned in the state, even as state lawmakers are considering a bill to effectively repeal the expansion plan approved by voters.
You jumped from a tub and for that you got fame,
They are very accessible and seem to be the new buzzy product, Karen Wilson, a tobacco researcher and pediatrician at Mount Sinai's medical school in New York, told the AP.
A few weeks later, Barnett and co-authors Nathaniel Stewart and Todd Gaziano issued a 16-page legal memorandum via the Heritage Foundation that outlined a constitutional case against the health-care measure. According to Blackman, the paper became a source of talking points during congressional debate and laid the framework for subsequent court challenges; Barnett represented one of the plaintiffs.
House Republican leaders announced this week they plan to bring opioids-related legislation to the floor next week, culminating an effort over the past few months by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to pass nearly 60 bipartisan bills making mostly modest, incremental changes to how prescription opioids are distributed and how people can access addiction treatment.
NASA remembered those who died in the pursuit of space exploration:
The trust, which says it has donated about 60 million pounds, or more than $79 million to organizations in the United Kingdom since 2010, has now said all philanthropic giving will temporarily cease so the issue 'will not be a distraction for institutions that are applying for grants,' The Guardian's Frances Perraudin and Ruper Neate report.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker ultimately agreed to testify publicly amid a subpoena standoff with the House Judiciary Committee. (Reuters)
Shalala: Congress would have to provide subsidies and close some doughnut holes. A deductible is basically a doughnut hole. I would be particularly interested in [deductible] subsidies for people that have slightly higher income because I think that they're the people that are really having a challenge.
Wray demurred: Under federal law, under U.S. law, there is no list of domestic terrorism organizations the same way there is for foreign terrorist organizations.
OUCH: Women who say breast implants made them sick are calling on the Food and Drug Administration to take action to protect patients, such as providing more information about potential risks.
But even those sympathetic to Sanders plan recognize that it may be difficult to instantly cut provider payments. Physicians across the country may not face a 40 percent pay cut, but Sanders is hoping thousands of doctors and hospitals can absorb cuts to their payment rates without going out of business. Polling from last year suggests they're warming to the idea.
But fetal viability timing has progressed from around 24 to 28 weeks more than four decades ago to closer to 22 to 26 weeks now, Ariana notes. It's a change that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor predicted, warning Roe v. Wade was on a collision course with itself.
This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.
Last week, you pressed elevator buttons with abandon. You weren't afraid of the free weights in the gym. You washed your hands for barely enough time to say 'Happy Birthday' once, let alone sing it twice. How bold are you now? Maura Judkis and Avi Selk write. Coronavirus anxiety has outpaced the virus itself. … Nikhil Merchant, 38, has taken to meticulously wiping down the treadmill at his suburban Los Angeles gym before he uses it. 'Your senses are heightened to kind of superimpose germs sitting on that machine,' he says. Merchant had completed the ritual on Monday and was about to begin his run when he spotted a wad of chewing gum in the treadmill's cellphone pocket and fled the gym in­ over­whelming mysophobic disgust. … Suspicion of treadmills and elevators mutates into suspicion of fellow humans: Are other people washing their hands for two Happy Birthdays? How much do I really know about the habits and histories all these friends and co-workers and strangers who are touching all the things I'm touching right before I forget not to touch my face?
He will not have the votes, Rand Paul added on CBS's Face the Nation. Everybody is being nice to everybody because they want us to vote for this, but we're not going to vote for it.
Trump wins the presidency. Romney later reports that he wrote in a candidate for the presidency in lieu of voting for Trump: his wife, Ann Romney.
He shoots from the hip. He's not racist. He's a businessman, not a politician. A dealmaker. Working even during his vacation. Always on the brink of following through on his important campaign promises. Willing to buck his own party to get things done.
OUCH: Yet, the first-of-its-kind gene therapy to treat a rare form of blindness will come with a hefty price tag of $850,000. The FDA approved the landmark treatment last month and many expected the drug could be priced at $1 million, writes The Post's Carolyn Johnson.
The senator was relying on a somewhat dated 2011 estimate from the Department of Health and Human Services. That report said that 50 million to 129 million (19 to 50 percent of) non-elderly Americans have some type of preexisting health condition.
The United States currently has among the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world, a trend exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The nation provides less financial support to families with children than all but a handful of developed countries, Jeff writes.
The move also comes after the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to the top insulin manufacturer asking for information about how it sets prices for its products.
Mike and I do not share all the same political beliefs, but I believe the role of the Senate is to evaluate every nominee based on whether he or she is professionally qualified, Sinema said, and can be trusted to faithfully interpret and uphold the law.
— Chinese citizens are accustomed to strict censorship, but the epidemic has put the government's censors and security forces on the defensive, our Post colleague Gerry Shih reports.
The CATO Institute holds an event for the book Overcharged: Why Americans Pay Too Much for Health Care.
• Guarantee 12 weeks of paid leave from work for new parents or those caring for an ill family member. An employee on leave would get two-thirds of his or her pay, up to $4,000. The bill Biden supports would fund this by increasing the payroll tax paid by employers and workers.
Trump, saying the quiet part out loud, admitted that he opposes Jeff Sessions because he didn't take control of the Russia probe:
At the same time, high rates of vaccine hesitancy among Black people may exacerbate disparities. Many nursing home and hospital workers in the Washington area — a group that is predominantly Black and Latino — declined to be vaccinated, citing mistrust of the vaccine and the medical establishment.
Trump surrogates scoffed at that offer Sunday, with Short declaring that Senator Schumer might talk about bipartisanship, but he has no interest in bipartisanship whatsoever.
If this is not resolved very quickly, Ginsburg said, it clearly will be disruptive, because there is a lot of money involved.
Genetic testing can also be pricey. The National Institutes of Health has found it can cost from $100 to more than $2,000.
The proposal, which will be formally introduced later this week, is part of a series of principles the nation's largest business lobby will offer in a bid to help shape the debate about upgrading U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other critical infrastructure. Chamber President Thomas J. Donohue said his organization wants 'to put our oar in the water' and acknowledged that it would be 'a tough vote' to raise the gas tax for the first time since 1993. But he said that support has been building in the business community and elsewhere.
. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is scheduled to hold a hearing on combatting the opioid crisis
Republicans could say they tried their best and hope that their base doesn't get too riled up that Obamacare is still the law of the land.
On the stump, Yang sounds the same as he does on podcasts. There is no high-flying rhetoric; there is, instead, a long diagnosis of why political elites have been completely wrong about the economy. Even the gross domestic product, he says, is an outdated concept that, as president, he would walk across the street, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and get rid of.
Dingell also went aggressively after government contractors who wasted taxpayer money. Stanford President Donald Kennedy was forced to resign in 1991 after Dingell's investigators uncovered that the university had used federal grants meant for scientific research to help pay for a 72-foot yacht on the San Francisco Bay, along with fancy floral arrangements.
Virginia's existing Medicaid program is one of the least generous in the nation. To be eligible, a disabled individual can make no more than $9,700 a year. The cutoff for a family of three is $6,900. Able-bodied, childless adults are not eligible, no matter how poor.
I think there's a road map, said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.). Whether we're going to be taking a six-lane highway or a four-lane highway, I don't think that's been determined yet, but we know the direction that we want to go.
Members of her group began contacting Brat's office after the November election over worries about Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon. She said they've grown increasingly anxious about about Trump's policies on health care, immigration and other issues.
He notes that people often watch TV with the sound off, or view it in a noisy public space, such as a restaurant or a gym. In these cases, a banner can be a powerful lure, drawing in a viewer who otherwise wouldn't understand what's being discussed or reported.
In a nearly two-hour meeting in the Oval Office on Monday night — his first in-person session as president with members of Congress — Biden conferred with 10 Republican senators who have proposed a far skimpier alternative, less than one-third the cost.
But two new polls suggest that immigration may not be as effective an issue for Trump in 2018 as it was two years ago. In fact, Trump's fixation on building the wall and reducing the number of immigrants who are allowed into the country appears to be a key reason that those ideas are becoming less popular.
Meanwhile, Biden has managed his left flank with unexpected skill, showing progressives he values their ideas and keeping them inside the tent. They're still vigilant, watching out for disturbing appointments and policy walkbacks, but so far they've had much less to complain about than one might have predicted given that Biden explicitly ran in the 2020 primaries as a moderate.
JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, pledged to unveil a plan in the next few weeks to support local investment — really constructive, thoughtful things for all of our constituents — but added that most of the windfall will end up elsewhere, with much of it going to the bank's bottom line this year and later.
-- The White House hasn't turned over a single piece of paper to my committee, House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) writes in an op-ed today for today's paper: The White House is engaged in an unprecedented level of stonewalling, delay and obstruction. I have sent 12 letters to the White House on a half-dozen topics — some routine and some relating to our core national security interests. In response, the White House has refused to hand over any documents or produce any witnesses for interviews.
To understand PhRMA's opposition, just look at how much Medicare pays for medicines under each program. In Part B, the government generally pays a drug's average sales price plus 6 percent. But in Part D — which operates more like the commercial market with private insurers bidding to provide coverage — drugmakers pay an average 23.8 percent rebate off the list price of their medications, meaning some goes back to those paying for the medicines to begin with.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that a mutant variant of the coronavirus, first seen in Britain, may become significantly more common in the United States. Cases have so far mostly been isolated and there is no evidence that the variant is driving the latest surge in cases. But experts expect that the variant is present in much of the country and will likely spread, The Post's Joel Achenbach and Ben Guarino report.
They found the following, from a sample of nearly 420 million medical claims in 2017 across 963 markets:
When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.
The Pacific Northwest is home to some of the nation's most vocal and organized anti-vaccination activists, she adds. That movement has helped drive down child immunizations in Washington, as well as in neighboring Oregon and Idaho, to some of the lowest rates in the country, with as many as 10.5 percent of kindergartners statewide in Idaho unvaccinated for measles, she adds. That is almost double the median rate nationally.
#GOPDnD: An ongoing quest in which the newly empowered Republican Party and its leader, Trump, battle tax codes, illegal immigration and — finally — the great forces of Obamacare, occasionally arguing about dice rolls along the way.
Bloomberg has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump's tariffs on Chinese exports, which led to retaliatory tariffs against American imports. China is the biggest market for American soybeans, and farmers like those hosting Bloomberg today in Wells, Minn., have suffered because of the trade war.
I don't think any of those people would have rolled out the immigration thing the way that it was rolled out, said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), speaking of Romney, Bush and Rubio.
Not true at all, Sanders said during a town hall in Charleston that aired on CNN last night. I'm the senator from a small state, and I did not give any consideration to running for president of the United States until 2015. He added that he was very busy running for reelection in 2012. In fact, I ended up campaigning for Obama, and I'm a strong supporter of all that Barack Obama has accomplished, he said. Joe is a friend of mine. I've known him for many years. But you know what happens in campaigns? At the end of the season, it's called silly season. People say things they should not say.
Paying for drugs isn't a simple matter of what the manufacturer charges. As companies sell their medicines to pharmacies, which in turn bill private or government insurance plans, pharmacy benefit managers (known as PBMs) act as middlemen to negotiate which drugs are covered and how generously.
As patient organizations gain ground lobbying Congress and the administration, experts have begun to question whether their financial ties could push them to put drugmakers' interests ahead of the patients they represent, they write.
Jones responded that expanding Medicaid under the Trump administration is different from doing it under former president Barack Obama, because now it will be easier to get federal waivers to require recipients to seek work and other requirements that will make the system more fiscally prudent.
Section 7004 — Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation Operations and Maintenance calls for $1.5 million to conduct, the operations, maintenance, and capital infrastructure activities of the Seaway International Bridge.
There will be a pool camera providing a live feed for those folks interested. Details on this will be available shortly. And on Friday, obviously there's a wide range of events celebrating the inauguration that is available from the Presidential Inaugural Committee.
Trump repeated a versions of this claim several times on March 12, March 13 and March 15.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) warned House Republicans in dire terms not to risk their political careers on something that's bound to fail. Do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that cannot pass the Senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote, he said on ABC's This Week. I'm afraid that if they vote for this bill, they're going to put the House majority at risk next year.
Indeed, Gorsuch, now 49, seems naturally equipped for his spot on President Trump's short­list of potential Supreme Court nominees.
Shalala: If you see the look on the face of home health-care workers who got Obamacare for the first time in their lives and got free primary care the first time they ever went to the doctor, boy, you want to extend this to everybody. I hope we can find some incentives to get more governors, including mine, into expanding Medicaid because a lot of Republican governors have done it — they've done it under waivers.
Asked by Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) whether maternity care should be a covered benefit under federal law, Price said consumers should make that decision in the coverage they choose, not the kind that the government forces them to buy.
President Donald Trump has called for litigation against companies over their roles in the opioid epidemic, reporter Nate Raymond writes. But Monday's brief signaled that the Justice Department would not be seeking to participate as an active litigant in the litigation before Polster, who is overseeing at least 433 opioid-related lawsuits brought primarily by cities and counties...The lawsuits generally accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and allege distributors ignored red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. The defendants have denied wrongdoing.
The plans to expand federal subsidies for ACA health plans is part of a proposal the House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve by the end of this week.
For 40 years, the position of the executive branch is that you can't indict a sitting president, Barr said under questioning from Blumenthal, adding: I actually haven't read those opinions in a long time. But I see no reason to change them.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation's health-care system by working on two tracks as he also pursues other elements of President Trump's agenda.

Inslee: Focusing on climate change, he said that on my last day on earth he wants to be able to look his grandchildren in the eyes and tell them that he did everything possible to save the planet.
And then there are the tensions between Ryan and Trump, a fraught relationship dating back to the presidential campaign that was once again cast into doubt Saturday when Trump asked his 27 million Twitter followers to tune in to the Fox News show of Jeanine Pirro — who proceeded to call for Ryan's removal as speaker.
-- Audio from a 2015 Aspen Institute appearance purportedly features Bloomberg defending his stop-and-frisk policy. From Mediaite: Bloomberg appears to tell the audience that cops targeted minority neighborhoods 'because that's where all the crime is.' … In the roughly minute-long excerpt, Bloomberg begins his argument defending stop-and-frisk by saying: '95% of your murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops.'
RUBIO: And, that's what Donald has done throughout his career.
When Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tried to warn Trump about the viral outbreak in January, the president instead changed topics to air complaints about an aborted federal ban on vaping products, The Washington Post has previously reported.
Here's what you need to know about the latest DACA decision:
Richard Louis Hanna was born in Utica, N.Y., on Jan. 25, 1951, and grew up in Marcy, N.Y. He followed his father into the construction trade, which paid for his education at Reed College in Portland, Ore. He graduated in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in economics and political science.
Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.
And the experience of other countries tells us that households and businesses do not pay their full share of taxes where leaders boast about paying no taxes at all, and do not adhere to immigration rules when leaders are seen to flagrantly violate them. This is other countries, right?

Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said in an analysis that $23 billion is specifically allocated in the bill for helping people with pre-existing conditions. That would cover about 110,000 people. If states allocated all of the other available funding, that would cover 600,00 people. Approximately 2.2 million enrollees in the individual market today have some form of pre-existing chronic condition, the analysis said.

This is the opportunity for PBMs to explain how they bring value and savings to the system, said Jon Conradi, spokesman for the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, an advocacy group whose members include pharmacy benefit managers. Big Pharma has done a fairly good job, because of the clout they bring, in trying to define PBMs as unnecessary middlemen.
The product is still on the market and the companies have won the six cases related to Xarelto that have so far gone to trial.
There is no proven clinical benefit of infusion of plasma from young donors to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent these conditions, and there are risks associated with the use of any plasma product, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
-- Trump is traveling to El Paso on Monday to argue that border fencing saved the city from massive crime. But El Paso's leaders, including its former congressman and possible 2020 contender Beto O'Rourke, say the president is portraying a false image of the city. Robert Moore, Philip Rucker and Jenna Johnson report: Trump hopes spotlighting the story of El Paso — touting its border fencing and relatively low rate of violent crime — will provide evidence supporting his push for funding for part of a U.S.-Mexico border wall to avoid another shutdown, aides said. … The trouble for Trump is that his claim about El Paso is simply false. His portrayal of this border city as having been violent and lawless before the installation of fencing has long been an irritant to local civic and business leaders. ...

Trump's Twitter feed makes global news. Pence's does not.
GOP aides said Trump's tweet yesterday morning, in which he wondered aloud what is the purpose of the House passing a bill that won't clear the Senate, further deflated efforts to build support because it signaled to wavering lawmakers that there is little reason to risk a conservative backlash by voting for the more moderate alternative.
Whatever Washington, D.C., may be focused on at any given time, rest assured, President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the issues that matter most to the American people: good jobs, safe streets and a boundless American future, Pence told about 350 business leaders gathered for a summit on foreign direct investment in the United States.
The Cabinet hearings signify the beginning of President-elect Trump (inaudible) to drain the swamp and bring real change to Washington. Rex Tillerson, as many of who know who have gotten to talk to him, has an unparalleled experience from running a large organization with global reach. He's known as a tough negotiator and has the (inaudible) to implement American-first (ph) foreign policy.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost or will lose their health insurance, and taxpayers are still on the hook, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said at a Senate Finance hearing on the co-ops in January 2016. In some ways, the co-ops were doomed to fail from the outset … they were limited to less profitable markets, had no historical claims data and no brand recognition or trust.
So if you are a college, again what is your accountability? If you raise prices, what happens? Well, it's tougher on families, but they'll just get the loans from the government. It's tougher on your graduates. But you know, at that point, they're out of your hair. And so what are your incentives as a university to try and keep your costs under control? Not very high. What are your incentives to treat your adjunct professor like a human being? Vanishingly low because you've got an ever-replenishing pool of people who want to do that job because many Americans have dreamt about being a professor. And if you're a university, then theoretically you can do no wrong because you're a nonprofit and no one's going to come to you and say, hey, some of these practices are really bad for their country.
Over the past two years, the immigration court backlog has grown by hundreds of thousands. Recently numbers reached 800,000, of cases primarily involving people who have been released from custody or who have never been in custody.
I understand that things have changed since 1992. I held on a little bit longer to keeping strong sentences maybe than others, Barr said, noting that he had not been serving at the Justice Department for several years. I support an adjustment to these sentences and the safety valve and so forth.
It's the administration's latest move to expand alternatives to the marketplace plans offered under Obamacare and it comes on the heels of issuing looser rules around association and short-term health plans. But this new effort might mean embracing a part of the ACA instead of spurning it.
-- Mike Pompeo ordered U.S. diplomats to limit any contact with Iranian opposition groups, including MEK, which has paid thousands of dollars in speaking fees to former national security adviser John Bolton in addition to retaining Giuliani. From Bloomberg News: The directive about Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, its offshoot, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, and five other groups was delivered in a cable sent to all U.S. diplomatic outposts on Tuesday. ... It says meetings with the groups could jeopardize U.S. diplomacy with Iran. … But it provoked displeasure from some Iran hawks, who argued the U.S. should be encouraging contacts with such groups, not discouraging them.

That's what happens when you have an unpopular president . . . popularity scares people, said Ari Fleischer a former adviser to President George W. Bush. Lack of popularity emboldens them.
The Post previously reported that Adrian Urias, an AutoMedx co-founder and current shareholder, advised the Trump administration's covid-19 task force on ventilator purchases. While the contract for the ventilators was relatively small in context of the hundreds of billions spent on coronavirus relief, the connection to the White House raised questions about the fairness of the selection process, Reed and Aaron write.
That's not the entirety of the Yang platform. He has ideas ranging from what to do with failing suburban malls (offices, churches, indoor recreation spaces, anything we can do to keep these spaces vital) to a proposal to turn tax day into a holiday (bring two taxpayers who filed their taxes early from each state to a celebration at the White House) to an idea that would stop airlines from overbooking flights (force airlines to have customers 'auction' their seat back).
The 77-year-old is expected to face a vigorous challenge in November from a decorated Marine fighter pilot with a record of big-dollar fundraising. Yet McConnell has shown an unerring instinct for self-preservation across six Senate terms and a record stint as Republican leader.
During the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Andey Riffle doesn't blame his employer. The small company was doing its best under difficult circumstances, he said, when the rising cost of insurance under the ACA finally led it to stop offering health benefits for its workers.
Lamenting the punitiveness of the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war, as well as the influenza pandemic after the armistice, Bloomberg said he's thought through various counterfactuals. If we'd had Harry Truman with the Marshall Plan, we probably wouldn't have had a second war, he said.
Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, a long-standing goal of Republicans, has sputtered in recent weeks amid disagreements and confusion about the path forward, as well as anxiety about what will happen to people currently covered under the law.
— In a zoom-in on what issues could emerge in forthcoming debates on House Democrats' Medicare-for-all legislation, HuffPost's Jonathan Cohn outlines some questions to consider when talking about such a plan. Those issues include whether to eliminate private insurance altogether, including employer-sponsored coverage that remains mostly popular, how generous and comprehensive coverage and cost-sharing should be, and how government should regulate prices throughout the system and finance such a program.

Temporarily ban most foreign Muslims from entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. Trump would allow exceptions for dignitaries, business people, athletes and others who have proven themselves. Although Trump's aides, surrogates and running mate insist he no longer wants this so-called Muslim ban, Trump himself has yet to fully disavow the idea and it is still posted on his campaign website. (Trump did not ban all or most Muslims, but did institute a travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries.)

For years, drug companies have been aggressively increasing prices on existing drugs and setting higher launch prices for new drugs while recording windfall profits, Cummings said in a statement. The goals of this investigation are to determine why drug companies are increasing prices so dramatically, how drug companies are using the proceeds, and what steps can be taken to reduce prescription drug prices.
Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans care for the next three decades.
He effectively stole a Supreme Court seat by refusing for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama's eminently qualified nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill a vacancy. And, expanding on earlier transgressions by Democrats, he blew up generations of Senate procedures and precedents requiring the body to operate by consensus so that he could confirm more Trump judicial appointees.
Voters are forcing the question at the ballot box as Medicaid emerges as a big issue in initiative campaigns and gubernatorial races, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. It's getting harder for states to stand in the way of Medicaid expansion and all the federal money on the table as the symbolic barrier of Obamacare fades.
President Trump, with the flick of a pen, ended that new policy, making it harder for Americans of modest means to obtain their piece of the rock, the American Dream — home ownership, Schumer said on the Senate floor. It only took an hour for those populist words delivered on the steps of the Capitol to ring hollow.
KASICH: Now, I also believe -- I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools. You need mentoring in those schools. And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree. And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools. All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.
— Azar outlined the steps his agency is taking, in an interview yesterday with Fox Business host Lou Dobbs. Azar said flights containing 84 percent of travelers coming to the U.S. from Wuhan are being funneled to the major cities of LA, San Francisco and New York and the flight plans of the other 16 percent will be changed to they can also be surveilled before entering the U.S.
— Trump is sending a plan to Congress that calls for stripping more than $15 billion in previously approved spending, hoping it will temper conservative angst over ballooning budget deficits, Erica and our colleague Damian Paletta report. Almost half the proposed cuts would come from two accounts within the Children's Health Insurance Program, while an additional $800 million in cuts would come from money created by the Affordable Care Act to test innovative payment and service delivery models.
A few doubted their leader's abilities, but Trump always prevailed.
But his campaign team quickly walked back the remarks. Jeff Weaver, Sanders' longtime political adviser, told POLITICO following the town hall that Sanders was 'certainly not talking about shutting down the industry tomorrow.' He said Sanders wants more study and regulation of the industry to ensure that it is safe and that 'the federal government needs to act strongly in those areas,'  David and Sarah write.
Upon retirement, the recipients of paid family leave could choose to delay their Social Security benefits by three to six months. This latest version of the bill would also give them the option of having the sum gradually deducted from their benefits over the first five years of retirement.
TRUMP: They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction; there were none. And they knew there were none.
TRUMP: ... The only reason that is was a D was because we didn't care -- we didn't give them the information...
And I will say this. These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters. And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.
RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record, that's not up to the New York Times. That's up to you, Donald. If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration...
Inevitably, people worried about outside interference with an app of unknown security standards. Or about the sort of sheer incompetence that marred the launch of the Obamacare exchanges. I saw more than one tweet to the effect of: These people can't even count a simple vote and we're supposed to trust them to take over the health-care system?
First lady Melania Trump visited a public school in New Delhi to attend a 'happiness class,' part of a special curriculum introduced across India's capital in 2018 to emphasize well-being alongside academic achievement. … [Meanwhile], Trump and Modi claimed progress Tuesday toward a comprehensive trade deal, but a chummy atmosphere between the two leaders during Trump's state visit could not mask frustration that the long-delayed pact is still in limbo. Trump predicted that a successful deal is in the offing but gave no deadline. The United States had once hoped to have the agreement ready in September, when Modi visited the United States.
Elizabeth Warren. She's heading to four states over the weekend, including two — California and Georgia — that vote shortly after the first four big primary states. (The trip includes her first stops as a candidate in Nevada and South Carolina, too.)
The takeaway: Tax credits aren't up for debate.
If Bannon is really arguing that overly aggressive repeal-and-replace, including major cuts to the Medicaid expansion, carry political peril, that's potentially significant. There are good grounds for concluding this: It appears that the ACA, and particularly the Medicaid expansion, helped produce large drops in the ranks of the uninsured among non-college whites, who voted overwhelmingly for Trump.
From categorizing it as tough language to saying they don't recall that specific phrase, Trump supporters are downplaying his shithole countries remarks. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
The Food and Drug Administration has also warned about genetic testing that hasn't gained approval from the agency, including those that guide antidepressant prescriptions.
From Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.):
Edwards's defiant tone was emblematic of her pugnacious approach to politics, which has won her ardent supporters but has also alienated some of her colleagues.
For example, Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have been seeking a dedicated $45 billion fund to treat opioid addiction. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), meanwhile, has been pushing to eliminate more ACA regulations and allow people to buy insurance policies across state lines.
By the end of 2018, the federal debt held by the public — the total of all past annual deficits — was near $16 trillion, equal to 78 percent of the economy (gross domestic product, or GDP). On present trends, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the debt will reach $29 trillion in 2029, about 95 percent of GDP.
Yet the administration has drastically stepped up its response to the growing coronavirus outbreak.

Wednesday's economic rescue package, the largest in U.S. history, would boost unemployment benefits even more. The bill expands eligibility and offers workers an extra $600 a week for four months, in addition to their benefits under state unemployment programs.
TRUMP: Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. I give the example -- I'm going to build a wall. I'm the one that wants the wall. I'm the one that can build the wall.
Mulvaney also promised Americans with preexisting conditions will still be guaranteed coverage even without the ACA, which mandated such protections for the first time. Republicans are trying to … pass a piece of legislation that meets the requirements of the United States Constitution, he said on CNN's State of the Union.
We want to see a stable market where we can make sure everyone has access to coverage, and that's why we think it's so important at this juncture for states to take control back, Handelman said.
Trump's appeal to voters is, and always has been, how he is able to speak to them on an emotional rather than an intellectual level. He got people angry and worried in the 2016 campaign — and they voted on it. They went to the polls feeling as though the stakes were literally catastrophic; elect anyone other than Trump and watch the world burn.
The Green New Deal has received little consideration from most senior House Democrats, who saw their centrist Blue Dog Coalition go nearly extinct a decade ago after Pelosi and other leaders forced moderates to vote on cap-and-trade legislation to manage industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. While more than 65 progressive House Democrats have signed onto the Green New Deal, many other Democrats privately scoff at the resolution.
Another patient visited Alibini's emergency room the next day suffering from vision loss and severe pain after getting eye injections from the same company. After seeing both patients, Albini reported the cases to the FDA.
On foreign policy, Biden asserted, America First is America alone. He criticized the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani and laid into Trump for dismissing brain injuries among American soldiers as headaches. He gave an impassioned answer damning Trump for abandoning Kurds in Syria, reminding the audience he opposed adding troops to Afghanistan. He acknowledged a mistake in voting for the Iraq War but made the case he knows how to restore U.S. credibility. He defiantly took credit for both the Iran deal and the Paris agreement.
Planned Parenthood leaders announced yesterday they're working with lawmakers in more than a dozen states to introduce bills expanding access to abortion or pulling back on existing measures that limit it. They include a bill to repeal Missouri's 72-hour waiting period before a woman can obtain an abortion; Maine legislation allowing nurse practitioners to prescribe abortion pills and a bill restoring family planning funding that former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) had cut from the budget.
It wasn't something most Republican were interested in having a conversation about between now and November, said Lanhee Chen, a health-care policy expert who advised now-Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) during his 2012 presidential bid.
4 p.m.: Barr 'very concerned' by courts blocking administration policies nationwide
The president's attack had all the hallmarks of a coordinated effort:
KELLY: All right. Let's talk immigration for a little bit. Senator Cruz, let's start with you. You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty. But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump. If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies, isn't their choice rather clear?
-- Trump's biggest donors, who have been briefed on his theory of the case, are giving him a very long leash because they are playing the long game. The atmosphere was buoyant at a conference held by the conservative Heartland Institute last week at a downtown Washington hotel, where speakers denounced climate science as rigged and jubilantly touted deep cuts Trump is seeking to make to the Environmental Protection Agency, Matea Gold and Chris Mooney report. Front and center during the two-day gathering were New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, Republican mega-donors who with their former political adviser [Bannon] helped finance an alternative media ecosystem that amplified Trump's populist themes during last year's campaign.

(Reis Thebault) More than three-quarters of business economists expect a U.S. recession by 2021, according to a National Association for Business Economics survey. The majority also estimate that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates this year. (Bloomberg News) California Republicans picked a Latina to lead the party into 2020. Jessica Patterson, an ally of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will become the first woman in history to lead the California Republican Party after a series of losses in the 2018 election.

(Michael Brice-Saddler) A Kansas legislator repudiated his support of an anti-LGBT bill after his daughter shamed him about it in an open letter. Kansas state Rep. Ron Highland (R) said that sponsoring a measure that would describe same-sex unions as parody marriages was a mistake. (Lindsey Bever) A South Carolina woman died from her injuries after two of her dogs mauled her. Authorities said the dogs, both boxer mixes, became aggressive with Nancy Cherryl Burgess-Dismuke while playing with her. It went from looking like they were really playing to them really eating her alive, a neighbor said.
But underneath him, the GOP fault lines on Trump were growing.
The gross national product, she said, had grown more than $1.5 trillion since Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of 2017. So when we're concerned about a deficit being created or a debt being created — the economy has already grown an excess of $1.5 trillion, she said.
The commissioner's April 5 departure date may make this particular goal a distant one, Bloomberg's Anna Edney reports
His tweet appeared at 8:21 a.m. as official Washington prepared to tune into Sunday news shows: Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!
In a separate scrum with reporters, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said that advocates from states that had expanded Medicaid wanted a soft landing.
Before the appearance, he previewed his comments in an interview with the Bulwark's A.B. Stoddard.
But Americans should understand that there will be a significant, long-term economic cost to our polarized politics and dysfunctional government, which has now reached the point of near-total breakdown of comity and cooperation between the parties, between the houses of Congress and among the various branches of government.
Moreover, the United States has lagged far behind other major countries in providing tests for possible cases. The CDC initially distributed flawed tests to state and local health departments. The lack of tests in the United States, compared with countries such as South Korea that have tested tens of thousands of people, has meant the possible spread of the virus in the United States may not be fully known. The Washington Post reported a number of mishaps that led to testing delays.
The tax changes are expected to encourage saving, investment, and work, the CBO said. In CBO's projections, it boosts the level of real GDP by an average of 0.7 percent and nonfarm payroll employment by an average of 1.1 million jobs over the 2018-2028 period, according to an April 2018 report.
Cotton, an Army veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who has built a reputation around his hawkish national security views, also backed Trump's foreign policy approach. He said the president made the right call with his decision to strike a Syrian air base last month.
Biden's comments came during a bipartisan summit on cancer legislation that probably will preview a central aim of his post-pandemic health agenda.
What would not change: a laissez-faire approach to the campaign trail, approaching any media interaction not as a risk, but as a way to get the Yang name out there. The day before his event in Randolph, Yang told the Daily Beast that, if elected president, he would encourage parents not to circumsize their sons. When conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro challenged Yang to a debate on the topic, Yang tweeted back that he would be happy to do so.
Wolff details how Trump did not take well to living in the White House, recounting a reprimand to the housekeeping staff for picking his shirt up from the floor. Trump also reportedly imposed a rule that no one touch his toothbrush.
Upon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.
-- Howard County saw a bigger swing from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 than any other in Iowa. The Wall Street Journal's John McCormick took the pulse for 2020: Recent interviews with dozens of voters here suggest that most of Mr. Trump's 2016 supporters ... plan to stick with him, even though some said they have grown weary of his personal behavior and trade fights. Among those who previously voted for Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, many said they are reserving judgment until they see who wins the Democratic nomination. … What such swing voters do in 2020 will have national implications. Before Mr. Trump, Howard County hadn't backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. It is one of the 31 counties in Iowa—the most of any state—that backed Mr. Obama twice and then switched to Mr. Trump. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Still, other Trump administration actions — such as eliminating the individual mandate and promoting the use of non-ACA compliant plans — run the risk of destabilizing the market.
President Biden and Vice President Kamala D. Harris were sworn in, just hours after the 45th president, Donald Trump, left the White House on Jan. 20. (The Washington Post)
What we will do is lay out for the American people exactly what steps [Trump] can and probably will take to try to undermine the law, so they understand when he takes those actions . . . that he is the one taking away health-care coverage from millions of Americans, said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
New systems are faster and more flexible than ever, he said, making it easier to change elements on the fly. (Maybe too easy: ABC News apologized recently for a not-even-close-to-accurate on-screen banner that said former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had pleaded guilty to five charges of manslaughter.)
But just -- just to set -- because I fully understand what you're asking. When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started. I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
It's a radical [Saul] Alinsky group, Sperry told Fox News's Sean Hannity after the story ran. It's got a lot of money. And they're training an army of agitators to sabotage Trump and his policies, while at the same time protecting Obama's legacy, like 'Obamacare' and the 'dreamers.' And here is OFA listed prominently on Obama's new Web site, OFA Organizing for Action.
Political control R Reagan R Senate D House Why it happened Congressional leaders wanted to spend billions to create jobs, but Reagan opposed it. The Democratic House opposed funds for a nuclear missile program. How it was resolved Congress abandoned plans for the jobs spending, but also funded legal support for poor Americans over the president's wishes. Reagan signed it anyway.
Good news: The Biden administration reported Monday that the United States was averaging 2.4 million shots daily during the past week.
A House Republican accused his colleagues of hypocrisy:
Second, Biden is an insider — exactly what we need to mobilize the federal government, fight through bottlenecks and help state governments that are now overwhelmed. He rattled off a list of actions that he would take in his interview and later in the town hall, including fully implementing the Defense Production Act and setting up a federal bank initiative to ensure that small businesses get their loans. (He noted on ABC that Bank of America came out and said unless you already have loans with us, unless you already have worked with us, unless you have a credit card with us we're not going to — even though they're government-guaranteed loans, we're not going to process those loans.) He wants to hear what Trump is doing to ramp up testing and why he is not reopening the Obamacare exchanges. A president, Biden effectively tells us, knows what the heck he is doing and how to do it.
Coming out of Tuesday's meeting, which focused on how to handle Medicaid cuts, the other members of the working group didn't rule out the conservatives ideas. Asking about making essential benefits opt-out, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said he'd look at the idea.
Those tax credits would replace subsidies the ACA provides people with incomes of up to 400 percent of the poverty level to help them afford health plans through marketplaces created under the law. The credits would be available to everyone who buys coverage on their own, wealthy or poor. But the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the credits, as conceived at the moment, would be too small to help low-income people afford health plans. They also wouldn't make much difference to affluent people, according to the CBO, since most of them already are insured.
More than two decades ago, during the Clinton administration, the nation endured an unprecedented government shutdown. The Clinton-Gingrich impasse of 1995 to 1996, which remains the longest to-date, caused hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be furloughed.
As the debate over Trump has burgeoned, mental-health advocates are also becoming frustrated by some of the words used on social media to speculate about Trump's state of mind – words like unhinged, crazy or unstable. They fear the use of such language will perpetuate the stigma around those with mental-health conditions, feeding into assumptions that such patients can't be trusted or successful in life.
Create thousands of new jobs in construction, steel manufacturing, and other sectors to carry out this work. Only American workers will be hired for these jobs. (Trump cleared the relatively low bar of thousands of such jobs early in his administration. It's undoubtedly false that 100 percent of those occupying such jobs are American, though.)
She noted that in April, after Florida received a $1.5 billion authorization from federal officials to fund a program paying hospitals for charity care known as the low-income pool, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) suggested spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a dike upgrade and tourism promotion.
The health insurer is one of several major businesses that vowed to halt campaign donations to lawmakers who voted against certifying the electoral college results of President-elect Joe Biden's win. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Marriot and CVS Health Corp. have made similar commitments in the wake of a mob that breached the Capitol.
Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Trump tweeted Friday, adding Also, don't forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!
Ryan's chamber passed its own bill and is invested in trying to get a bill to Trump's desk. The speaker supported Johnson throughout his campaign with donations, including money for the state party, and by joining Johnson on a four-day bus tour of Wisconsin that included a rally with Pence.
I haven't shaken someone's hand in a year, but I gave him a big handshake, Silverman says. And I go, 'Look at us. We were arch enemies and now we're best friends.' 
Representing Montanans in Congress, he saw first-hand the need for responsible development of public lands. And he understands the importance of our public resources to job creation and the growth of our economy. That's why he has the enthusiastic backing from sportsmen's groups, conservationists, ranchers, the energy industry, Native American tribes, and of course, so many in Congress, some of whom liked him so much they wanted him to actually stick around and run for the Senate.
A forecast used by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects the death toll will reach at least 405,000 deaths by the end of January.
If this package was clearly about crushing the virus, then why is less than 9 percent of all total spending actually used to put shots in people's arms?
Trump made this comment in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, who noted that there were now eight cases in the United States. The Trump administration had imposed an entry ban on all foreign nationals who were in the People's Republic of China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, in the previous 14 days, effective Feb. 2. Trump reportedly had been reluctant to impose the ban, citing his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but the action was urged by his top health advisers. The virus was already spreading through the United States. But the testing criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were extremely narrow: Only those with recent travel to China or those who had come into contact with a confirmed infection would be tested.
Then-President Barack Obama spent an inordinate amount of time criticizing the Supreme Court for its decisions during his tenure, as The Washington Post's Greg Jaffe reported a few years ago. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama took the opportunity to criticize the justices' ruling on Citizens United, prompting Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to mouth the words not true. When the justices took up a case involving Obamacare, Obama remarked, This should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn't even have been taken up.
So why hasn't the measure become law? The bill lacks backing from the Koch-backed group Concerned Veterans for America — which has lobbied hard against it — and, perhaps for similar reasons, the White House. Advocates had hoped to get the bill included in the massive spending measure Congress passed last month, but in the end didn't succeed.

— A senior career Justice Department official has resigned in the wake of the Trump administration's refusal last week to defend the ACA in a lawsuit from 20 Republican-led states challenging its requirement to have health insurance, The Post's Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report. Joel McElvain, who has worked at the Justice Department for more than 20 years, submitted his resignation letter Friday, the morning after Attorney General Jeff Sessions notified Congress the agency would not defend the ACA.

Meanwhile, at the DNC meeting unfolding in the District this week, the leaders of state parties are submitting their delegate selection plans for 2020. The next big changes on that are really up to state legislatures, and the march of states from caucuses to primaries is continuing at a steady pace. Washington, which has been under total Democratic control since early 2017, is on pace to bind its delegates to a primary, not a caucus.
Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder found that prioritizing people who don't already have natural immunity could allow health officials to get more impact from limited supplies, especially in areas where many people have already been infected, according to a modeling study that has not been peer reviewed.
Biden should do all that he can to make it impossible to earn anything approaching a living selling drugs on the black market — which means ending what we call the war on drugs.
Newsom's plan comes as other state's are looking to move forward with state-based plans instead of waiting for the federal government. Massachusetts, Washington and New Jersey have new or recently expanded policies on the books, and Jim and Claire report Oregon, Colorado and Connecticut are poised to follow. Still, Newsom's proposal for California would be the most generous.
During a fundraiser last night in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, Biden never referred to Sanders's challenge during 20 minutes of remarks. Speaking to 350 people in a former studio executive's backyard – Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother were in the crowd – he reminisced instead on the accomplishments of Barack Obama's administration, including Obamacare, the auto industry bailout and the Paris climate accord. He remembered how bad the economy was when they took power in 2009. Everything but locusts landed on his desk, Biden said. Suggesting that Sanders's attacks were on his mind, Biden mused as an aside at one point about his support for raising Social Security benefits for people over 85.
Then, Republicans lost the House in the midterm elections. Trump's bargaining position weakened. Faced with a pending government shutdown, Democrats offered Trump $1.6 billion for border security in exchange for funding the government.
Moreover, it's not as though Sanders has ever gotten consensus for and passed his self-described socialist ideas. Other candidates can claim victories in passage of green-energy legislation and support for state compacts to adhere to the Paris Agreement, both of which address the problem of climate change. The Green New Deal hasn't been implemented because, in its idealized version, it lacks substantial political support and won't pass.
Contrary to CMS's bigger goal, the agency's proposal … would in fact raise costs for most Medicare beneficiaries, Eyles wrote.
When I talk to people of all different races and different genders and different backgrounds, they say they are looking for someone with a history of delivering results, Van Hollen said. It's not enough to simply vote a certain way or to provide sound bites. Real work involves forming coalitions to deliver results.
At a news conference in Burlington, Vt., he conceded the obvious — we are currently losing the delegate count — but insisted he is winning the policy debate and the generational debate. I'm not sure what the latter means, since his wave of young voters never materialized and former vice president Joe Biden is winning everywhere, even college towns. Biden could say he is winning the race, gender, married, unmarried, college-educated and non-college-educated debate. He is winning. Period.
Trump's acting director of national intelligence worked for a nonprofit group funded mostly by Hungary.
Many of those who live along the border in Texas say that while there has been a dramatic increase in the number of migrants caught crossing illegally, the border itself has been heavily restricted for nearly a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Welfare is a broad term and can apply to people who are working but receiving some government assistance. If someone is receiving means-tested assistance, it doesn't necessarily mean they are not working.

Our Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Paul Sonne have reported Wilkie built his career working alongside polarizing figures and was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends Confederate symbols. CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.
Today begins a series of this week's eight confirmation hearings that will be held on the nomination of the president-elect's Cabinet. This morning at 9:30, Senator Jeff Sessions kicked off his hearing as the next attorney general. I think the president said it best when he said, quote, Jeff has been a highly respected member of the U.S. Senate for 20 years. He has a world-class legal mind and considered a truly great attorney general and U.S. attorney in the state of Alabama. Jeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone he knows, end quote.
But in conservative media, where the claim originated, Trump has gotten credit for cracking open a plot by a deep state of critics and conspirators to bring down his presidency. And the perpetrator is former president Barack Obama.
That's way too long to sit there, District says (Duncan Stevens)
Reading from the teleprompter at the dinner, Trump said he's working with Republicans to come up with a great health-care plan that is far less costly to the people. And he reiterated such a plan would wait until after the 2020 elections. I will be asking that this be my first vote immediately after the election, he said, telling Republican lawmakers in the room: You're going to win your elections based on healthcare... It's a great incentive for the voters to vote for you.
Hogan said during a news conference on Tuesday that he will keep an open mind. But he expressed reluctance to support any proposal that penalizes residents for not purchasing insurance.
The FDA has indicated it probably will take a similar approach with new vaccines and therapeutics aimed at coronavirus variants: We do not believe there will be the need to start at square one with any of these product, the agency's acting director, Janet Woodcock, said in the statement.
Ryan made his comments two days after a special investigative panel formed by Republicans issued a report recommending that Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, lose its access to Medicaid reimbursements and federal family-planning funds. The GOP report also recommended that Congress allow states to exclude abortion providers from their Medicaid programs.
Though a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the Senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. Only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. Among Biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for Medicare and expanding Obamacare. Reconciliation could also empower Democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by Republicans as well as portions of Biden's climate and immigration priorities. The Congressional Review Act also will enable Democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the Trump administration with simple majorities. Democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only Democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.

Schultz's advisers have said that the data backs up his decision to explore a run, and Schultz himself points to extreme positions — he used the word six times on CNN — as proof that he's right.
It's a hell of a way to start an administration — one that could cost you votes rather quickly. And nobody knows that better than Obama.
The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.
Graham then advised them he wasn't worried about losing his job.

New York Times reporter Emily Cochrane:
Collins has spent more than 20 years forging a singular brand of political standing, emulating her political idol, Margaret Chase Smith, the Republican senator who was one of Joe McCarthy's sharpest critics in the early 1950s.
I want to get something done now, he said at a breakfast event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. That's why I don't want to repeal Obamacare; I want to add to Obamacare, and I want to help people now.
The measures include medical teams from the Coast Guard, the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as private contractors who triage and examine migrant children. The U.S. military is also helping to evaluate and treat migrants. Border agents, including hundreds who are paramedics, monitor remote areas, Maria writes.
Tighten up rules around individual marketplace coverage.
These three companies play an outsize role in the country's drug prices, as they negotiate payments between insurers and pharmaceutical companies for medications used by about 180 million Americans. They'll undoubtedly characterize the drugmakers as the villains who push list prices ever higher, while arguing their own role is crucial for obtaining rebates and other savings that ultimately result in consumer savings.
Forget the green lipstick. Stay away from the ferns. Cancel Fox and Friends. Scrap the rage-tweeting. As President Biden sells his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package, he and his team have leaned on a traditional White House communications model that includes heavy reliance on local and regional news outlets in 10 states.
Trump will have a private dinner with supporters tonight. He has no other events on his schedule.
Senate Republicans pulled in the opposite direction yesterday, trying to advance a bill to make the Hyde language written into permanent law and ban federal subsidies for any Obamacare marketplace plans that include abortion coverage. They failed to gain the 60 votes needed, opposed by two Republicans and all but two Democrats.
The House and Senate GOP plans backed by Trump probably would have resulted in higher costs for people with preexisting conditions in some states, according to the Congressional Budget Office. As noted above, the Trump administration did not defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit that would end protection for preexisting conditions.
In the U.S. government, there are several senior officials on the president's staff and across the executive branch who are responsible for at least some element of this important relationship. But no senior-level government official is singularly in charge of attending to all of its dimensions and coordinating policymaking across agencies, subject matter and personnel. That's a problem when our relationship with China involves so many areas of public policy.
No details of the Friday exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were released, nor was it clear if more details would later be publicized.
But McConnell has indicated he has no interest in trying again to repeal Obamacare. And the other three senators Trump mentioned in his tweet have stressed they're focused on ways to lower health-care costs generally rather than try to scrap the health-care law.
An analysis by The Washington Post found that of the 35 counties where residents stand to lose the most in financial assistance under the GOP plan, Trump carried 33 — in many cases, by overwhelming margins.
—No, Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) bluntly told The Post's Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey when they asked whether the two Senate committees overseeing health-care policy are planning to draft an ACA replacement.
From stations equipped with six monitors, staff at Mercy Virtual are able to manage a massive triage system where they can alert the providers physically present in each hospital if a patient needs attention. Whereas a nurse in a traditional hospital may be assigned just a few patients to monitor, the nurses at Mercy Virtual can be monitoring 40 to 80 patients at a time using the triage information, Mercy Virtual President Gavin Helton told me during a recent visit there.
If he aims a proposal aimed at the middle class and the poor people . . . we could work with them. But I don't think they're headed in that direction, and they're going repeat the same mistake they made with the health-care bill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) predicted of tax reform on This Week.
Democrats fell into that trap when passing the ACA, he said. We should not be overselling.
The reason I have a little doubt — just a little! — is because he grew up, and nobody knew him. When you interview people — if I ever got the nomination, if I ever decide to run — you may go back and interview people from my kindergarten, they'll remember me. Nobody ever comes forward. Nobody knows who he is until later in his life. Very strange. The whole thing is very strange.
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days, Trump said. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth.
OOF: The insurer Centene is being sued by customers who claim the company misled them about the scope of benefits in Obamacare plans sold on the marketplaces. The plaintiffs allege contrary to the tone of Centene's advertising, they had difficulty or were unable to find medical providers who would accept their plans, Bloomberg reports.
Others, such as Castro, have called for winning border states such as Arizona and his home state of Texas, which have long been in the Republican column, a strategy that requires heightened turnout by Hispanics and those sympathetic to immigrants. Candidates like Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are more focused on increasing turnout among urban and nonwhite communities and have so far focused their immigration rhetoric on the morality of Trump's policies.
Last year, PhRMA launched a series of ads called Share the Savings, urging more commercial insurers to take this step to lower the prices patients pay for their medications.
We don't know precisely what Trump will say about all this. But Seema Verma, his appointee running the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, gave a hint yesterday that might send a shiver down the spines of PBMs. Verma called the system of rebates convoluted since it's unclear with whom PBMs are actually aligned.
Trump seems to believe that he knows more about everything (energy, medicine, diplomacy, nuclear weapons, intelligence, law enforcement, trade, etc.) than anyone, and yet his gaping ignorance and refusal to learn the basic facts imperil the country and the economy. Bloomberg should point this out over and over again.
— Jan. 25, interview with ABC News
Although addressing rising drug prices should be a bipartisan issue, Chairman Cummings did not consult with Republican Members before launching his investigation. Now, in light of Chairman Cummings's recent boast that his investigation has affected pharmaceutical 'stock prices '- and the Chairman's decision to unilaterally release sensitive information obtained by the Committee in another investigation — we feel obliged to inform you about these matters, they wrote in the letter.
This threat against Kemp wasn't new. On Dec. 5, at another rally, Trump publicly encouraged former congressman Douglas A. Collins to challenge Kemp in the 2022 gubernatorial primary. Nor has Kemp been the only governor to face a similar threat. Gov. Doug Ducey (R-Ariz.) was targeted last month, too.
It might be easy to brush off this latest plot line from Bornstein as another wild episode in this season of the Trump administration, but our colleague Aaron Blake warns that trivializing it would be a mistake.
In 2000, Robert Herring Sr., who is 76, sold the family's business, Herco Technology, for $122 million. He retired and met a woman in Russia who became his third wife. An insomniac, Herring spent much of his nights watching TV. After a while, he decided to dive into the business himself.
In the 2018 midterms, voters in the Republican-leaning states of Nebraska, Utah and Idaho approved ballot initiatives expanding Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently approved Maine's Medicaid expansion, which was also approved via the ballot.
Melania Trump has often been described as reticent to enter life in the public eye. Recent actions indicate she may be ready to embrace her role as first lady. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, it's not your turn. You'll get your turn, sir.
— William Barr, Trump's nominee to serve as the next attorney general, is scheduled to appear for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning. Ahead of the hearing, the group Protect Our Care released a set of questions for the nominee who could succeed Jeff Sessions, including whether Barr agrees with the administration's decision not to defend the ACA in court and whether he agrees with the ruling last month by Texas Judge Reed O'Connor that the ACA is unconstitutional.
He is a leader in Congress on conservation issues. He has supported measures to manage America's public lands for hunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts. In Congress, he negotiated a historic water compact between the federal government and a tribal community in the state of Montana. He's got a reputation for taking on tough issues, cutting through the bureaucracy, and we look forward to his confirmation. Today, Betsy DeVos will meet with the Senate HELP Committee at 5 p.m. She will be introduced by former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.
I do believe the product before us reflects a path for Virginia that we can all be proud of, Jones said.
It is his effect on the judiciary, however, that has cemented McConnell's reputation as master of The Long Game. (The title of his memoir alludes to his focus on not just the Senate but also our constitutional order.) After Justice Antonin Scalia died in early 2016, McConnell would not allow hearings or votes on a Supreme Court nominee before Election Day. He made clear that the American people would decide who nominated the next justice. McConnell's GOP caucus confirmed Neil M. Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett M. Kavanaugh in 2018 — the latter in the face of a scurrilous assault — ensuring a five-justice conservative majority. McConnell has prioritized populating the federal bench with originalists and during the Trump administration has presided over the confirmation of 51 federal appeals court judges, 138 district court judges and other judges to specialty courts. The effects will be seen for at least a generation.
We're not seeing skinny plans, said Coleman, who founded a website last year with information on association health plans. We're seeing the regular doctor care, we're seeing emergency room care, we're seeing mental health coverage.
And, now that Democrats have seized the House majority, abortion opponents' hopes of accomplishing major goals such as defunding Planned Parenthood or passing a federal ban on abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy have dimmed further. They're refocusing their strategy on passing incremental legislation at the state level — and hoping it's upheld by the courts.
An 18-year-old Ethan Lindenberger from Ogio explained he read scientific studies, including from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and tried to persuade his mother to let him and his four younger siblings get vaccinated. I looked into it, it was clear there was way more evidence in defense of vaccines, he told The Post. But his mother resisted.
After Trump prevailed, Trump turned to Ailes for advice on a chief of staff, the book says.
Under questioning from Sasse, Barr also echoed a common theme from the hearing and pledged independence as attorney general, telling senators that he would quit rather than carry out an unlawful directive.
Ryan outlined three phases in which health-care reform would be achieved: first, via the special budget procedure known as reconciliation, of which the current measures are a part; then, through regulations at the Department of Health and Human Services; and finally, the passage of other bills that will need bigger backing and could include the ability to buy insurance across state lines.
Trump's lawyers and the GOP-led states bringing the lawsuit against the ACA have said there's no hurry to decide it. But Democrats, who clearly feel Texas v. Azar is a political liability for Republicans, had been champing at the bit for a final decision before the November election.
Asked whether he considered himself a progressive, Hickenlooper said he was; asked whether he was one of the more centrist candidates looking at the presidency, Hickenlooper said that might end up being how voters see it.
For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
This same inability to make trade-offs has also prevented action on a host of other Republican priorities.
Authorities said they do not know yet whether the killings were racially motivated, but the shootings raised concerns among advocacy groups, who have called attention to a string of high-profile attacks on people of Asian descent.
The Kaiser Family Foundation holds a forum on healthcare prices.
Like other Democrats who have won statewide races by campaigning on the Medicaid expansion, Kelly emphasized that it would expand health coverage to thousands of working people — many people on Medicaid work — and would shore up hard-pressed hospitals, including in rural areas. That's in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016 by more than 20 points.
Le respondemos a los escépticos con un rotundo: sí. Hay muchas razones para esperar que el mensaje de Biden, transmitido con evidente pasión y no poca elocuencia, pueda tener un efecto real. Una razón es que, a diferencia de Trump, no lo contaminó con rencor por las matanzas y los trabajos robados, ni enfrentó a un público recto contra el stablishment explotador. En cambio, instó a la humildad y pidió a aquellos que no nos apoyaron que me escuchen. Además, Biden se acercó al podio inaugural sabiendo cuán peligrosamente Trump profundizó las divisiones, especialmente el 6 de enero. Su descripción de la democracia como frágil se basó en esta experiencia, que muchos en su audiencia vivieron de primera mano. La presencia de destacados republicanos —el exvicepresidente Mike Pence, el senador Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), el representante Kevin McCarthy (California) y el senador Roy Blunt (Misuri)— en los invitados fue una señal prometedora, más resonante seguramente que el mensaje mezquino que envió Trump al no presentarse.

But Perriello is no Sanders-like rabble-rouser. He reads his crowds, he absorbs information quickly, and he formulates cogent arguments heavy on anti-Trump defiance.
The legislation from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) looks to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to fast-track reviews and inspections and allow temporary imports in the case of a drug shortage or if there are fewer than five competitors in the market for medicines approved for at least 10 years.
The risks of such a health profile are well known: heart disease, strokes, diabetes and high blood pressure, to name a few.
Such skewed results could undermine Iowa's special position in our national primaries. After all, the only reason I'm here is that Iowa is first; otherwise, a very rural, very white state with a population of 3.1 million wouldn't attract much attention. We come here because it is the first chance we have to see actual voters expressing their desires. So Iowa tried to give us a more detailed accounting of those preferences — and flubbed it.
Trump wants all able bodied patriots to come. Jessica Marie Watkins, Ohio bartender and founder of a small, self-styled militia, planned ahead for the insurrection, federal prosecutors allege, Rosalind Helderman, Rachel Weiner and Spencer Hsu report . In text messages cited in court documents, Watkins explained her rationale:
Soon after arriving in Philadelphia, two senior Republicans found themselves on the defensive over Trump's latest comments regarding voter fraud that doesn't appear to exist and an executive action reopening the contentious issue of secret sites for using enhanced interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects.
The tone of the Feb. 12 email that Perry sent senior ICE officials was urgent.
2. The real reductions to future Medicare spending are considerably smaller than $845 billion. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget explains, it's closer to $575 billion because the administration's budget moves two parts of Medicare — payments to hospitals that treat higher shares of uninsured patients and payments to hospitals that educate medical residents — to another part of the budget.
Krugman's critics on the right will surely take issue with his writings on Trump's economic policies by pointing to record-high stock prices and the 11-year expansion of the U.S. gross domestic product. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with Krugman's underlying message that the current system is hurting the poor to the benefit of the rich and corporations. According to the Census Bureau, a key index that measures the gap between the wealthiest and poorest Americans is the highest it has been in 50 years.
The interaction is about human behavior and our ability to reshape even the ugliest confrontations by trying just a bit harder. It also highlights Silverman's special superpower, the ability to use her glow and an awwcomeonbuddy nudge to convert all sorts of nasty mojo.
Over the course of several hours earlier in the afternoon, Schiff had laid out 10 separate arguments for why Trump's push to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden was intended for the president's personal benefit and not to advance the national interest. When we're done, we believe that we will have made the case overwhelmingly that the president is guilty, Schiff said. Is there really any doubt about this? I mean, do we really have any doubt about the facts here? Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he's charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing … because, of course, we know that he would.
Some of this stems from the fact that Planned Parenthood has less real estate than it used to. The latest report says the network operates more than 600 clinics around the United States, compared to 860 clinics 13 years ago.
The death rate for people with Ebola is not and was not a virtual 100 percent. The case fatality rate (or the percentage of known infected people who die) of the virus does vary dramatically — from 25 percent to 90 percent — depending on the outbreak. In general, it averages around 50 percent. It's hard to know the case fatality rate of the coronavirus yet, but estimates put it below 3 percent.
Pro-expansion forces have taken their cues from Northam, a soft-spoken pediatrician and former state senator whose approach is more honey than vinegar. Rather than blasting Senate holdouts, they have run newspaper ads with an expansion plea signed by hundreds of faith leaders.
Earlier today, the U.S. Embassy in China sent its second alert to its citizens in two weeks over the unexplained illnesses, urging Americans to seek medical attention if they experience unusual, unexplained physical symptoms or events, auditory or sensory phenomena, or other health concerns, the Associated Press's Kelvin Chan and Dake Kang report.
State officials project as many as 36,000 Ohioans could lose Medicaid coverage for failing to meet the requirement, the Columbus Dispatch's Catherine Candisky reports.
Much of the conversation has centered on opposition to removing the filibuster from Democrats Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.). But roughly a fifth of Senate Democrats have committed to doing so, by our count.
AHH: Our Post colleagues Tracy Jan and William Wan have more detail on the impact to the social safety net of the partial government shutdown. Cabinet heads say they're working to ensure benefits continue through February.
We saw those images. Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria is heartbreaking, Castro said, in English.
We remain very concerned that countless clinics across the country continue to market violative stem cell products to patients, the FDA wrote. And we will not shy away from taking further steps when we see bad actors taking advantage of patients, and putting them at serious risk, for their own financial profit.
Cruz also got a good look at the Laura Ingrahams, the Breitbarts and the rest of the Trumpkins who spew conspiracy theories, xenophobia and out-and-out falsehoods. Cruz came face-to-face with Fox News, which has become the junkyard of journalism. We imagine he has learned the shortcomings of the right-wing media echo chamber and will refrain from venerating talk radio and Fox personalities.
The company said the net price was $135 per patient per month for Humalog insulin in 2018 compared with $147 in 2014, the Wall Street Journal's Peter Loftus reports. Meanwhile, the average list price for Humalog increased 51.9 percent to $594 per patient per month during the same period. Eli Lilly says that's because it increased the rebates and discounts it paid to middlemen in the drug-supply chain as the list price for Humalog increased.
She also took issue with Trump's position on immigration, including that he wants to stop the things we put into place to have people come over and actually become citizens.
Prakash, asked about Republicans pushing for more votes on the resolution, reiterated that activists did not expect to pass it. She pointed to the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN Iowa poll, which found Democratic support for the resolution at 79 percent and climate change emerging as a top issue.
Washington Examiner columnist Byron York noted in the first week of hearings, quote, Ended up being far less adversarial than expected, either because Democratic attacks lacked energy and focus or the nominee was able to deftly handle the situation or both. Democrats are clearly desperately trying to politicize this process and it's not working.
Stanford professor Mike McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia and a Post contributing columnist, demanded that Blackburn present evidence:
The economy is growing, jobs are being created and the federal government is collecting record tax revenue, Renna said. She added, It's also worth noting that the CBO projection doesn't always get it right. One notable example is that their projections about Obamacare enrollment were significantly off the mark. (The CBO overestimated how many people would buy insurance on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act, but its overarching estimate of how many people would gain insurance coverage was largely on target, as we've reported.)
It's typical for political candidates to spend more time talking about what's wrong with the country rather than what's right. After all, they need to motivate voters to turn out at the polls. But in taking that approach with health care, the Democratic candidates have inadvertently highlighted the ACA's glaring shortcoming: It didn't lower the fundamental cost of medical services and health insurance.
That mean comment dismayed congressional Republicans, especially House members who had to be cajoled into supporting the bill at all. Democrats have leapt at the political opportunity it afforded them to tar the GOP over its health-care effort. Reporters asked Republican leaders yesterday to respond to Trump's latest heart comment:
But later at a luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, Trump said he was very, very honored that Clinton — whom he derided during the campaign as Crooked Hillary — had attended the inauguration with former president Bill Clinton and asked the other dignitaries in the room to applaud the couple.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump made more than 280 promises, though many were contradictory or just uttered in a single campaign event. So that posed a conundrum: What would be a good list of promises to track that Trump was really serious about? We did not think it would be fair to rate a promise that might have been tossed out without much serious discussion by the candidate and his staff.
Jayd Henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because Congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.
Stanley, an attorney who opened a practice with his widowed mother after encouraging her to pursue her dream of becoming a lawyer, is a conservative Republican. But he opposes capital punishment, champions animal rights and pushes legislation meant to break the cycle of poverty in a region that, as he likes to say, was on the top of the economic food chain in Virginia just 30 years ago.
I think there's a lot of frustration all around town, said Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, which backed Freedom Caucus members in opposing the AHCA. In a couple of weeks people will look back and people will say the coalition in the Republican House and the Senate is a center-right coalition that wants to get big things done.
The overall momentum toward passing a bill made outside advocates like Brandon optimistic.
But let's be honest too about all this. The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage. Let's start talking again about the issues that matter to this country. I'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.
Asserting the administration supports making payments for the extra cost-sharing subsidies (popularly known as CSRs) insurers give the lowest-income marketplace enrollees and ending the practice known as silver loading (where insurers hiked premiums for silver level plans in order to compensate when the adminstration cut off the CSR payments). The notice invites comments from stakeholders on how the agency might address silver loading in the future.
The problem is that legislating health care, as we've found out, is a hugely messy process. Any replacement of funding would be subject to debate and would face an uncertain future. Democrats might hold out for more Medicaid funding. Republicans might hold out for less Medicaid funding or hold the line on something like cutting off Planned Parenthood. The GOP would essentially be gambling that Congress would have to pass something, thereby absolving them of whatever harmful effects might come from cutting off the Affordable Care Act in one fell swoop.
When you hear Mike Bloomberg on health care ... you should know he did it as mayor, he'll get it done as president, the ad says.
Obamacare will significantly soften the blow for many, but coverage gaps remain — many of which, unfortunately, are based on the politics of where someone lives. Those who live in the 37 states (including D.C.) that expanded Medicaid or in the 13 states (including D.C.) that run their own ACA insurance marketplaces—those states have reopened their doors for enrollees, even as the Trump administration refuses to do so for the rest of the marketplaces—will have more options to get affordably insured.
The House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittees on Health and on Economic Opportunity hold a joint hearing on addressing veteran homelessness on Jan. 18.
He mentioned just two parts of the law to keep, both favored by House Republicans despite their eagerness to axe the law. Trump reiterated his support for a rule forbidding insurers to refuse coverage to people with preexisting medical problems. And he said young adults should be able to stay on their parents insurance policies until 26 — an aspect he did not discuss during the campaign.
The survey also indicated Democratic voters are more interested in shoring up existing health-care law than passing a new law. Sixty-eight percent said lawmakers should improve or expand current law to cover more people, while 29 percent said they should pass a new law such as Medicare-for-all to provide universal coverage.
If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world, he said.
OAN staffers complained to Herring when the channel produced and aired a promotional spot that depicted a black police dispatcher refusing to send help to a white caller whose house was under attack. When employees called the spot racially incendiary, Herring agreed to take it off the air, but it remains on OAN's YouTube channel, where it has attracted more than a million viewings.
I'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.
Schultz is the former Starbucks chief executive who's considering an independent presidential run. His media tour, which included a prime time CNN town hall this week, is predicated on the theory that only far-left candidates would be able to make it out of a Democratic primary and would then lose to Trump.

Prosecutors are asking for 21 months in prison for Boucher, whose attorney is asking the federal judge to grant probation. Boucher is expected to be sentenced on Friday.
— HHS Secretary Alex Azar said the agency won't block insurance companies from using a workaround to buffer steep increases in health premiums for consumers, a practice known as silver-loading that had the effect of making subsidies more generous. Federal officials previously signaled they may prohibit the practice for next year's Obamacare plans. But at a Wednesday hearing before the House Education and Workforce Committee, Azar said doing so would require regulations, which simply couldn't be done in time for the 2019 plan period.

And lest you think it's just Ryan splitting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vocalized his disagreements with Trump, too. He's supported calls by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for an investigation into Russia's meddling in the U.S. election, and he's put a hard foot down on Trump's term-limit proposal. (I say we have term limits now. They're called elections.)
OUCH: A member of the opioid commission Trump commissioned last March says the GOP-led Congress is turning the panel into a sham by its unwillingness to put money toward the crisis. Everyone is willing to tolerate the intolerable -- and not do anything about it, former Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy (R.I.), a leading mental health advocate, told CNN. I'm as cynical as I've ever been about this stuff.
HOT ON THE LEFT: South Dakota law allows LGBT child services denial, from the New York Daily News: Adoption and foster agencies can legally refuse to serve gay people in South Dakota under a new law that activist groups have denounced as a 'dark new reality' for LGBT rights. Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed SB 149 on Friday, making South Dakota the first state to pass a so-called 'religious freedom' law since the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. The law says no child placement agency in the state can be required to provide services that conflict with any 'sincerely-held religious belief or moral conviction.' 'LGBTQ children in South Dakota's foster care system face the risk of staying in a facility that does not affirm their identity and actively works against the child's well being by refusing to give them appropriate medical and mental health care,' Human Rights Campaign legal director Sarah Warbelow said in a statement. HOT ON THE RIGHT: Sean Spicer ambushed while shopping at the Apple Store, from the Washington Examiner: White House press secretary Sean Spicer was accosted while shopping at an Apple store in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. 'How does it feel to work for a fascist? Have you helped with the Russia stuff? Are you a criminal as well? Have you committed treason too, just like the president?' a woman filming Spicer asks.
-- Washington will get a taste of spring today, but the city could see wet snow by the weekend. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Could see a broken line of showers, and perhaps a gusty thundershower, move through from west to east this morning into early afternoon. That means some spots could get briefly soaked while others stay dry as a cold front tracks across the area. Temperatures start out on the mild side this morning, near 60 to the mid-60s, but then drop back into the 50s during the afternoon, as winds gust from the west-northwest around 40-50 mph.
George also rebutted a dubious claim from Trump's campaign manager, which the president retweeted, that the two men don't know each other. In fact, he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, often concerning legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president.

Sanders tried to placate organized labor last year by modifying Medicare-for-all to let unions convert its savings into higher contract wages or extra health-care benefits, though it's hard to imagine what those benefits might be, given how sweeping Sanders's plan already is. Perhaps cosmetic surgery coverage, which Sanders previously ruled out.
The former vice president has leaned on his eight years of service in what he likes to call the Obama-Biden administration since announcing his candidacy for the Democratic nomination last spring, but he's becoming as explicit about it as ever. Biden's staff set up teleprompters last night next to a podium in a gymnasium at the College of Charleston, but he ignored those accoutrements and paced with a wireless microphone. He claimed the 2009 stimulus package wouldn't have passed without him. The president asked me to handle it, he said, referring to Obama. The president said … 'Sheriff Joe will do it.' Biden also touted the Affordable Care Act. Five Democratic presidents tried to get Obamacare or something like it passed, he said. We got it passed.

-- One of the two bases attacked, Irbil, is a major hub for U.S. and coalition military activity in Iraq. Erin Cunningham, Adam Taylor and Michael Brice-Saddler report: Many U.S. forces pass through Irbil on their way in and out of a network of much smaller bases in Syria. During the peak of the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq, military officials also oversaw a major battle in the nearby city of Mosul from Irbil. The city, like most of Iraqi Kurdistan, has been considered safer for U.S. personnel than other parts of Iraq.
The Omar kerfuffle. If left-wing Democrats remember anything from this year's conference, it will be the way that several leaders of their party criticized (not by name) the Muslim congresswoman from Minneapolis. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer pointedly reminded the crowd that there are 62 new House Democrats, not three, a line other frustrated Democrats have used to minimize the coverage of Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Economics, Politics, and the Fight for a Better Future
— A bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill meant to increase competition for drugs as a way to lower prices.
Yesterday I teamed up with my colleague Juliet Eilperin to scoop that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is working on guidance expanding the hardship exemptions from the mandate. Agency officials haven't finalized the guidance, but they aim to increase the number of reasons people could cite as justifications for being uninsured when they file their tax returns, according to two people familiar with the effort.

Every life is sacred, and . . . every child is a precious gift from God, Trump declared Tuesday night. We know that every life has meaning and that every life is totally worth protecting. Trump is doing everything in his power to protect those lives. That is why pro-life conservatives stick with him.

In all these ways, the administration has tried to undermine the ACA, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that deals with health-care services, said at a hearing yesterday. I would ask to what end? Due to the administration's actions, costs for families and working people are skyrocketing.
Some Freedom Caucus members are wary of efforts that would add to the federal deficit. But in a sign that Meadows may be willing to compromise on tax reform, he said that tax cuts don't necessarily have to be paired with spending cuts or revenue increases.
-- Health care is the top concern for the New Hampshire electorate, and it comes up more than any other issue during town halls and on rope lines. Amy Goldstein reports: The system's flaws come up nonstop: the expense of prescription drugs, a scarcity of mental health services, coverage gaps, and care that's difficult to afford even for people who have private insurance. … With one of the nation's highest median ages and a fast-growing older population, … people see close-up the limits of Medicare.
-- Schiff, a mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, has emerged as a surprisingly polarizing figure. Perhaps it's because the president has accused him of committing treason, in addition to calling him pencil neck and liddle. Trump has now tweeted about Schiff hundreds of times. Schiff's boosters say the right only loathes him because he's so effective.
The company's top engineers, Eugene Leonard and Leon Weissman, dubbed a later system the Chiron, after the wise and powerful centaur of Greek mythology, said Francis Mechner, one of System Resources' founders. The product was so successful that System Resources decided to change its name to Chiron in the mid-1970s.
Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream: But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay/ We may effect this business yet ere day.
But that may be where the agreement about Trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.
— Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation that would authorize Veterans Affairs doctors to prescribe medical marijuana.
Murray issued a scathing response, characterizing Democrats as the ones willing to negotiate. Democrats are not walking away from the table even if Republicans are, she said. We want the Republican health care sabotage to stop and we want families' health care costs to go down — and we are ready to work with Republicans as soon as they decide to join us and put patients and families ahead of partisan politics and special interests.
And you know what they got in these courses? Stuff you can pull off of Zillow. When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.
AHH: The Senate parliamentarian says COBRA subsidies can stay in the relief package.
Formally known as the Congress of Tomorrow, the GOP retreat's early steps felt a lot like the campaign of last year.
This accident of American historical development creates insurance-related job lock, incentives for overconsumption, a health-care system geared to the needs of households with income exceeding $100,000 per year — 84 percent of which are covered through their employers — and a large minority of uninsured.
Get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries. (Apple in 2019 moved Mac Pro production out of the United States to China.)
I'd go further still: There are numerous Trump lies being forced out into the open right now. Trump claimed he would not touch Medicaid and simultaneously that he'd repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better for all. It was a lie for Trump to claim he wouldn't touch Medicaid; it was a lie to suggest preserving Medicaid and repealing Obamacare were compatible; it was a lie to claim that his repeal-and-replace plan would result in better coverage for everybody. If anything, the White House's justifications only throw the scale and audacity of these intertwined scams, lies and betrayals into even sharper relief.
The Onion even made fun of the missing Senate health-care bill:
There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.
The Cheollima Civil Defense group released a statement over the weekend urging the media to keep their identities a secret so as not to be assassinated by Kim's kill squads.
The morning of the hearing, the House Oversight Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittee released a 46-page memo detailing how Juul marketed itself to Native Americans, BuzzFeed News reports. Juul visited reservations and pitched its products.
TRUMP: I'm not playing to anybody's fantasies, I'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime. The border is a disaster, it's like a piece of Swiss cheese. We're going to stop it, we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally. We're going to stop it.
Now, Americans have a 1 in 96 chance of dying from an opioid overdose, compared with a 1 in 103 chance of dying in a vehicle crash, NPR's Ian Stewart reports.
Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday unveiled a series of policy options to overhaul the nation's health-care laws, but substantial disagreements remained even as leaders aimed to conclude their perilous and divisive effort as soon as later this month.
But others onstage — Buttigieg and Gillibrand — said their goal was to arrive at that point quickly by offering federally run health care coverage as an option, and then counting on it to out-compete private care.
That same weekend, the Texas GOP added not one, but two planks to its platform clarifying that the party opposed allowing people to use any bathroom that did not comport with their gender at birth. Texas Republicans had been deeply conservative before Cruz arrived; whether or not Trump wins the presidency, a Republican who appeals to these voters is poised to win the state party's future. Cruz's allies see no gain in him endorsing the party's nominee, but an obvious advantage in him remaining consistent. A hypothetical 2020 campaign, without Trump in the White House, could be predicated on the same argument Cruz made this year: The party loses when it dismisses true conservatism.
Hanger was the only Senate Republican to favor expansion during the session, and even he wanted substantial changes to the House plan. The standoff forced the legislature to adjourn March 10 without a budget. Legislators need to pass a budget by July 1 to avoid a government shutdown.
They promise to solve the opioid crisis — while eliminating the requirement that insurance policies cover substance abuse treatment.
The aim has become very simple for House Republicans stumbling closer to passing a bill to revise the Affordable Care Act: just get it off their plates and over to the Senate.
Silverman, after telling the audience that blackface — under any circumstances — is wrong, invited actor Don Cheadle onstage to explain its history. He began to read off the teleprompter before stopping, in frustration, and turning to Silverman.
Edwards was also winning among younger voters and those making less than $50,000 a year; Van Hollen did best with seniors and voters with postgraduate degrees.
The upshot is one that will probably worry Democrats: Barr had essentially suggested that Mueller's findings would be filtered through the attorney general, who would decide what Congress and the public would learn. Barr had previously promised that his goal would be transparency, though he seemed to be managing expectations about a full airing of Mueller's findings.
The president absolutely did not ask Barr to interfere with the special counsel investigation, nor did any other official in the White House, Barr testified under questioning from Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.).
We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.
That's the question before all of you in this trial: Is this America? said [Raskin]. Can our country and our democracy ever be the same if we don't hold accountable the person responsible for inciting the violent attack against our country?
The National Institutes of Health and the rest of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are in full agreement about the importance of and continued need for aggressive research and dissemination efforts about Medication Assisted Treatment, NIH Director Francis Collins wrote to Pallone.
I didn't trust anything Donald Trump or the Republicans were saying, he said. A retired employee of the Metro system, he described himself as vacillating between being a Democrat and an independent.
Ryan's departure comes at an average length of time for House speakers: three and a half years. But it comes less than two years into Republicans controlling Washington for the first time in a decade, something Ryan dared not hope for during the presidential election and then was elated when he got.
To be sure, African American voters in South Carolina revere Obama. Dorothy Hollis, 77, retired nine years ago after 40 years of teaching high school. Now she teaches Sunday school and sings in the choir at First Calvary Baptist Church in Columbia. As Saturday looms, she's undecided and praying for guidance. I want President Obama to run again, to be honest, she said. He was an outstanding president. Like Abraham Lincoln, those don't come but every so often. So we have to take the next best thing and accept a flawed person and just go with it. But who is that?
Yes, CNN and MSNBC did this, mostly. Fox News didn't, though it has certainly served up some mighty troll-y chyrons for Hillary Clinton and Democrats. Example: A tale of two candidates. . . Hillary in hiding while Trump's out on the trail. (October 2016).
Christopher Wood, one of OAN's first news writers, recalled, We'd have staff meetings on Wednesdays, and Mr. H. would say he wanted more stories from Breitbart, the Drudge Report and other conservative sites. It was his way or no way.
You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in, Buttigieg said. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.
If men and women started companies at the same rate, they estimated there would be about 40 biotech start-ups that don't exist today, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson writes.
Tran first responded that it would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point. When pressed further by Gilbert, Tran responds: My bill would allow that, yes.
Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the percentage of people working two jobs has actually declined since the Great Recession — and been relatively steady at around 5 percent since 2010. The percentage bounced around a bit but it was as low as 4.5 percent in August 2017 and was 5.0 percent in the February jobs report, the most recent available.
OOF: A top policy aid to Pelosi reportedly met with top health-industry executives to express that Democratic Party leadership had reservations about the kind of universal health care plan some new members of the party are pushing.
Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA …. The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation! (Pair of tweets, April 2)

Is Trump fit to be POTUS?: Are we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here? . . . All of the above. No. No. I don't think he is, Pelsoi said. I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don't think he's fit to be president of the United States.
After months of repeating over and over that there was no quid pro quo, a chorus of Republican lawmakers are now parroting Dershowitz's line of defense. The GOP conference seems increasingly prepared to stipulate that there might have been a quid pro quo as a rationale to vote against calling Bolton as a witness. After all, if there was a quid pro quo but that's not impeachable, or even inappropriate, then Bolton's testimony might be considered moot.
That strategy prevailed last summer as the House narrowly passed a repeal of Obamacare after first voting against it. That vote is now top of the list of things Ryan brags about as his accomplishments as speaker. (The Senate voted down the bill by one vote.)
We have to restore our democracy at home, Bennet said. The rest of the world is looking.
— The father of a first-grader who was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was found dead in an apparent suicide.
Trump's proposed Medicare cuts amounted to a huge gift for Democrats, said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as White House communications director under President Barack Obama.
How many people have called your office to say, 'Mr. Schweikert, what is your plan for fixing this?'  Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) asked Schweikert on the House floor in February, as part of a back-and-forth about the fact that Ryan's big ideas did not enjoy broad support.
Wagner told a Republican group a couple of weeks ago he believes Medicaid expansion will happen, so he wanted to get engaged to make the plan as conservative as possible.
The incidents are related to an E.coli strain known as O103,″ according to the CDC. Eight people have been hospitalized but no deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which has affected Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia.
Mnuchin personally reviews department news releases and informational pages, while also interacting frequently with lawmakers, Federal Reserve officials, the SBA, foreign banking ministers, and international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, according to the people in close contact. On top of that, Mnuchin was also intimately involved much of this week in crafting the federal rescue package for the federal airlines.
Whether it made a difference in the political battle is unknowable. But it would have made the Democratic talking points less scary.
Given their lack of other options, pro-lifers accepted their second-class-citizen status in the GOP. Then along came Trump, a man who doesn't care what the Republican establishment thinks. He has embraced the pro-life movement in a way no other president has. In 2018, he became the first sitting president to address the annual Campaign for Life gala of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, founded in 1992. And now he will make history again at the March for Life.
People will say I'm a micromanager and involved in lots of details, Mnuchin said in an interview. A lot of money has been allocated to us by Congress and I want to be involved in understanding the details.
The realization that the Pennsylvania 18th won't survive court-ordered redistricting has not diminished both sides' interest in the race. Each side hopes this is an indication of things to come. However, the signal is unmistakable: If Republicans have to struggle to win a seat like this, they're in for a shellacking in the scores of more Democratic-friendly districts. Come to think of it, they might get a jump on the results and start panicking now.
By the end of the campaign, Ryan had broken up with Trump completely.
This is clearly a made-up figure. As of the end of 2015, there were nearly 180,000 pages in the code of federal regulations. So, in theory, that means getting it down to 45,000 pages. There were 71,000 pages back in 1975. Even under Ronald Reagan, the number of pages climbed almost 20 percent.
Even as Cotton reiterated his opposition to the ACA at that town hall meeting in April, he was determined to distance himself from the House bill that was introduced in March and championed by Trump. To the woman who voiced concerns about people losing coverage, he said: Part of my problems with the bill that was introduced in the Congress last month . . . is that it could have had that result, and it was moving too fast. I didn't think it got it right, that it was better to slow down, and get it right rather than get it fast.
Underwood and Hill won, both defeating veteran Republicans.
Last month, I asked whether Medicaid is starting to approach the political durability of two of the other major progressive welfare-state achievements of the 20th century: Medicare and Social Security. The news out of Kansas raises this question once again.
For hundreds of years the Black Christian church has been the central religious, social and political institution in Black American life. The church has survived racial acts of terror, including bombings, fires and mass shootings. As recently as December a group of neo-facists marching in D.C. vandalized Black churches displaying Black Lives Matter signs. The most elaborate and well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the United States was organized by Denmark Vesey, the co-founder of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., according to Vesey biographer David Robertson. Richard H. Cain, who was elected to the House of Representatives during Reconstruction, served as Emanuel's pastor. And the Black church is where a charismatic young preacher from Atlanta plotted a nonviolent overthrow of the racial caste system in the South.
From a Center for American Progress spokesman:
— Today the Trump administration will invite states to convert part of their Medicaid programs into block grants. The program will be branded as Healthy Adult Opportunity, Politico's Dan Diamond and Rachel Roubein report.
-- New York Magazine, Can the New Activist Passion of Suburban White Women Change American Politics? by Rebecca Traister: At Hearth, a restaurant in Sandy Springs, Georgia, about 30 people — most of them women, most of them white — are sitting at a long table on Saturday night, drinking white wine and beer, scarfing pizzas and salads and talking at a frenzied pitch … They are dedicating their time — in many cases, nearly all their time — to campaigning for Jon Ossoff … That Ossoff has come as close as he has is a startling signal of liberal vigor in Trump's America … Especially surprising is that the closeness of the race can largely be attributed to the obsessive energies of the sixth district's women, an army of mostly white, suburban working mothers who had until now lived politically somnambulant lives.
President Trump said on April 3 that we're going to be guarding our border with the military until a wall is constructed along the U.S. border with Mexico. (The Washington Post)
Furthermore, gun ownership is highly restricted in Ireland. People have to apply for a license to own a gun, and are likely to be refused under many circumstances. Furthermore, there are heavy restrictions on kinds of guns that they are allowed to own — roughly speaking, guns for sport and hunting (sports pistols; shotguns; some kinds of rifles) are okay, but handguns of the kind that O'Reilly could use for self-defense are not, let alone automatic weapons. Gun rights are not a topic of political debate in Ireland — Ireland's most conservative party, which is now the majority party in the government, has just introduced new restrictions, without any significant public opposition.
Previously, Barr noted at the hearing that he was nearing semiretirement when the possibility of serving as attorney general came up.
Immediately ask the generals to present a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy the Islamic State. (Trump did this upon assuming the presidency. The caliphate has been essentially eliminated, although that builds upon progress from the prior administration.)
Lawmakers' actions underscore how seriously they're taking this crisis. But many of them are putting words to their fear, too, in a way that drives home how the coronavirus is more like a world war than any other comparable challenge the United States has faced.
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement email obtained by The Washington Post shows that the administration has already entered crisis mode on the southern border.
— More doctors are using genetic information to help prescribe better antidepressants for their patients. But even as genetic information has been used to evaluate risk and treatment for diseases, using pharmacogenetics to address depression remains a controversial practice, our colleague Ilana Marcus reports.
How we define the role of government determines the need for financing. Ideally, we ought to face these issues sooner rather than later. The odds of this happening seem negligible. We deplore deficits but find them more acceptable than the alternative. No one really knows how much debt is too much. Our policy seems to be to wait until we discover the answer. But by then, it may be too late.
In short, to succeed in future political endeavors, Cruz needs to see voters as they are, not as he would like them to be. He will need to let go of pretenses (e.g., only he is a pure conservative) and roles (bomb-thrower in the party, victim of the mainstream media) that he adopted under the misconception these things would make him popular. He needs to leave aside the myths that hobbled Republicans and led them into a political dead end. He should forget expedient tactics (e.g. fawning over Donald Trump, blaming fellow Republicans for Obamacare) in favor of — dare we say? — sincerity. Not to put too fine a point on it, but he needs to be more self-aware, gracious and receptive to information whether it fits within an ideological narrative or not.
John McCain graduated 5th from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy, but was known as a fierce fighter, a loyal friend and a leader among his peers, the document says.
Sanders says he wants to do nothing to impair the party's effort to throw out President Trump. Nevertheless, the senator's online mob continues to spread disinformation about Biden, and his own staff calls Biden corrupt and makes false allegations (e.g., the former vice president wants to cut Social Security — which he does not). Sanders also posed a list of issues he would like Biden to address at the next debate (e.g., health care, climate change, racial equality). Biden will say what he has said all along, laying out his progressive but practical vision.
McConnell appeared to try to square things up with Trump at Friday's inaugural luncheon. The Senate leader, who is famous for expressing himself only when he needs to, took another lawmaker's seat so he could sit next to the president. For more than 15 minutes, McConnell did a vast majority of the talking, positioning himself in a such way that no one else could join the discussion.
A Bloomberg analysis of federal contract data shows that spending related to the environment reached 423 congressional districts in fiscal year 2016 and totaled $5.9 billion. Almost half that spending — 47 percent — went to districts represented by Republicans. That spending distribution could complicate Trump's efforts to cut environmental spending.
The White House did not immediately comment on this, so given the speaker, it's possible this is pure invention. But hopefully more reporting will get to the bottom of it.
The most immediate task ahead for Republicans is confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees. That has proven a challenging process, with Democrats uniting against many of Trump's selections. On Wednesday, Trump withdrew his pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, amid growing concerns among both Republicans and Democrats.
Did you go to Chao? a young woman in a pantsuit asked her friend, as they both searched for seats at one confirmation hearing in the Dirksen office building.
Nearly four months after a former congressman from Charlottesville shocked the political establishment by jumping into the race for governor of Virginia, state Democrats are locked in a contest that they didn't want but that the whole country is watching.
Not included in this analysis are Trump's endorsements of the Republican candidates in Georgia's two Senate runoff races, for which Trump held that rally Monday. The situation is a political unicorn in a lot of ways, but it also features the first contests since Trump lost his reelection bid. If a lame-duck Trump can't get two Republicans over the finish line in a state he lost by only 10,000 votes, why would Kemp need to be worried about his influence in two years' time?
BAIER: Governor Kasich, would you put ground troops in Libya?
You would not like it if I made some pledge to the president, Barr said. I'm not going to make a pledge to anyone on this committee to exercise his duties in some particular way.
I would argue that if you actually look back in history, the Democrats were very clear in 2008, that a lot of the -- some of the paperwork wasn't in on their nominees. They weren't always there entirely with the Bush nominees. But I think by and far, we're ahead of where where previous administrations have been and this is a political tactic more than anything.
The Trump administration says it's trying to improve affordability by expanding access to certain types of leaner, cheaper plans, but Democrats have characterized those plans as junk insurance and there's been little evidence on Capitol Hill of bipartisanship on the issue of health-care costs.
Allow Russia to deal with the Islamic State in Syria and/or work with Putin to wipe out shared enemies. (Trump routinely claimed credit for knocking out the Islamic State caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Although the United States became involved, there was no explicit partnership with Russia.)
This is no way to make laws. And what's even worse is that it's happening at a moment when Republicans — who in the past have been nothing if not skilled at undermining, vilifying, and sabotaging Democratic presidents — have seldom looked more feckless.
And Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who previously voiced openness to voting on health care in July, wrote Monday on Twitter that he was closing the door on delays. We need to do it this week before double digit premium increases are announced for next year, he added.
In one corner of a packed and muggy hotel ballroom sat a man wearing a black Team Trump T-shirt. But in another was a sign urging: TRUMPCARE GO (BACK) TO SIBERIA. At the front stood Tom Cotton, an ambitious Republican senator plunged into the crossfire on health care by the election of Donald Trump.
By the way, the Trans-Pacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need -- it is a disaster for our country. It's trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama. And I'll tell you something. The biggest problem with that is: They don't take into concurrence the devaluation. They're devaluing their currency.
The current situation is unacceptable Booker said in Spanish, adding that Trump had demonized immigrants for political gain.
Yesterday's Georgia runoffs handed Democrats two more seats, giving them a single-vote advantage in the upper chamber because Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris will serve as the tiebreaker. News of the victories was overshadowed when a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a shocking takeover that persisted through the afternoon.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson expressed some reservations about the bill, which only allows abortions to save the life of the mother and does not provide exceptions for those impregnated in an act of rape or incest. But the Republican governor said he signed the bill because of its overwhelming legislative support, as well as his long-held pro-life convictions, the Associated Press's Andrew DeMillo reports.
Block grants are the latest chapter in an unfolding fight between the Trump administration and Democrats over the future of Medicaid. Last week, Verma and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced a program called Healthy Adult Opportunity, in which states can agree to receive a lump-sum payment to finance care for adults who become eligible for Medicaid when the 2010 health-care law expanded it.
President Trump disclosed reimbursement of over $100,000 to personal attorney Michael Cohen amid the Stormy Daniels controversy:
-- A GOP congressman who is facing a tough reelection in the Denver suburbs called on Trump to fire Miller:
In every American state legislature and in most every legislature around the world, if there's majority support for a bill, it passes. In almost all cases supermajorities are only required, if ever, on things like constitutional amendments.
The $2.3 million, announced Monday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is being delivered after some of the groups, known as navigators, complained they had little money left after a regular enrollment season ended late last year, The Post's Amy Goldstein reports.
I think it is important that the Republican Party remain a conservative party, that we stand for principles and values that we not become neither hot nor cold but simply lukewarm, Cruz told the Tribune, and I'm going to do everything I can to empower and motivate courageous conservatives across the country to ensure that that's the case.
Bigger Medicare payments sound great to doctors and hospitals, but they're typically less enthused about risking earning less. Providers participating in similar arrangements have recently pushed back when CMS moved to subject them earlier to financial losses for underperforming. But like Boehler, Azar said he's confident doctors will want to participate in this latest experiment without any mandates. There's no need to do mandatory for the sake of mandatory, Azar told me over the phone yesterday afternoon.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the court sided with Republicans.
Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is expected to sign the bill, the New York Times's Sarah Mervosh reports. He praised lawmakers in the state on Friday.
The partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:
Trump once boasted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, and his supporters would stick with him. We don't know if that's technically true — and hopefully we'll never find out — but he's proved to have a Teflon coating that has kept his boosters remarkably loyal and his personal favorability durable. From Access Hollywood to Charlottesville and James Comey to Stormy Daniels, he's continued to consolidate support among Republicans and his approval among members of his own party has never been as high as it is now.
Price noted that as secretary he is now the named defendant in the lawsuit, and I'm not able to comment.
As soon as he takes office, ask Congress to repeal the defense sequester that limited the military's budget. (The process Trump was targeting — known as sequestration — remains on the books, but since 2018, it has essentially been displaced by new spending bills, and the limitations are due to end after 2021.)
Ryan's anguished on-again, off-again support of Trump has left him in no man's land inside the Republican Party — tainted by his endorsement of the nominee while facing a possible revolt by Trump backers for having largely abandoned him. Ryan is likely to withstand any attempt…to oust him…but Trump's attacks on Ryan may have done lasting damage to his stature among the party's base, just as he weighs a possible White House run in four years.
The bottom line is, the White House is going to work with organizations that support the White House, said Selnick, who recently left his post to return home to California. CVA has been very supportive of the White House, so they're going to have a seat at the table.
While Raimondo's immediate concern is for the plight of her state's hospitals and small businesses, she pointed to the double fiscal effect of the pandemic.
We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
Our goal is to pass Medicare-for-all and make health care a right, he wrote on Twitter. Today our job is to defend the Affordable Care Act from relentless attacks by the Trump administration.
-- The parking lot suicides, by Emily Wax-Thibodeaux: Nineteen suicides occurred on VA campuses from October 2017 to November 2018, seven of them in parking lots, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. While studies show that every suicide is highly complex — influenced by genetics, financial uncertainty, relationship loss and other factors — mental-health experts worry that veterans taking their lives on VA property has become a desperate form of protest against a system that some veterans feel hasn't helped them.
—Even a senior White House official directly involved in the discussions said there was no specific proposal, my colleagues write.
But Bloomberg, who is pumping millions of dollars into his entirely self-funded campaign, is running a single ad in 26 states that details where he stands in the health-care debate that has become a central issue in the Democratic primary. The ad, the only TV message Bloomberg is currently airing, is all about -- you guessed it -- health insurance.
But opponents note that the criteria put forth by Wagner and Hanger conflict in some ways with each other and with what Northam and the House want.
— For some federal workers, their missed paychecks may have future repercussions. Scores of government employees who went without pay also struggled to make child-support payments usually withdrawn directly from their paychecks, our Post colleague Samantha Schmidt reports.
A food safety lawyer in Seattle, Bill Marler, expressed concern that the CDC hasn't pinpointed a source of the infection.
Trump will be greeted as a pro-life hero, because he is one. He put two outstanding conservative justices on the Supreme Court and has appointed a record number of federal appeals court judges. He has allowed states to defund Planned Parenthood, defunded the pro-abortion U.N. Population Fund, and restored and expanded a ban, known as the Mexico City policy, on taxpayer funds for groups that perform abortions overseas. He has exempted organizations, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, that have moral objections to providing abortifacient drugs, from the Obamacare Health and Human Services mandate, and he has stood by the nuns as they fight to protect their religious liberty in the Supreme Court.
The district, a stretch of suburbs and small towns that was drawn to elect a Republican, was not the sort of place that Democrats had been expected to make competitive this year. Lamb's coalition pulled together suburban liberals, wayward Republicans and traditional Democrats who had drifted from the party on cultural issues.
AHH: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is still working on a scorecard for states to report how well their Medicaid programs are working, the agency confirmed yesterday to the Washington Examiner. CMS Administrator Seema Verma had mentioned such a scorecard in a speech last fall, when she said it would use state data to track whether positive outcomes from Medicaid and measure items such as the effectiveness of children's health care and treatment and prevention policies.
The Ryan-backed plan would offer a refundable tax credit that would provide the same sum to taxpayers of all income levels, even those who pay little income tax because of their low incomes. It would also be advanceable — that is, distributed throughout the year — to spare insurance buyers from having to pay their premiums in full before seeking reimbursement on the following year's tax return.
We have spent as of one month ago $6 trillion in the Middle East.
Your last term! Your last term! people were chanting by the end.
It may be tougher than he thinks. It would seem that O'Reilly's nearest Irish ancestor was his great-grandfather. This means that he misses the cut-off for automatic Irish citizenship by one generation. If you have one Irish grandparent, you qualify for Irish citizenship — but unless O'Reilly's grandparent or parent formally applied, he's out of luck. He does have a second possibility though — paying to become a citizen. Ireland, like many other countries, provides citizenship to individuals who are willing to invest or donate a large sum of money to the benefit of the Irish economy.
Section 7006 — Federal Transit Administration Grants sets aside over a billion dollars for Capital Investment Grants (CIG). Within this money, it is estimated that $112.5 million would go to the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) and Silicon Valley Phase II Extension Project.

You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.
The ACA requires most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. But during the Obama administration, federal agencies defined multiple circumstances in which people could be excused from that requirement. For example, people can qualify for a hardship exemption if they experienced a serious financial difficulty such as eviction or filing for bankruptcy — or a personal difficulty such as domestic violence or the death of a family member.
We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.
For the sake of argument, one could assume everything attributable to John Bolton is accurate and still the House case would fall well below the standards to remove a president from office, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement this morning.
RUBIO: This is why, because he's trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course. He's making promises he has no intention of keeping. And it won't just be $36,000 that they lose, it's our country that's at stake here.
Households where family members are struggling with addiction often are in turmoil, and in some cases children must be placed in foster care. In such chaos, Ice said, parents may not take the necessary steps to get their kids covered.
OUCH: The FDA ordered a mandatory recall of a Las Vegas-based company's kratom products that were contaminated with salmonella, marking the first time the agency has used a mandatory recall for a food product. The recall came after the company failed to cooperate with a voluntary recall. It involves powdered kratom, an herbal supplement used as a pain remedy, that was manufactured, packed and processed by Triangle Pharmanaturals, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
According to multiple GOP sources, Republicans are looking at whether to use reauthorizations of existing programs, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program, as vehicles for replacement measures. That could give them leverage to secure cooperation from Democrats.
Week 1415 was Part 1 of our annual retrospective; you could enter any of 25 contests from the first half of the past year. (Next week, the rest.) The Empress could easily have filled this column with nothing but inkworthy foal names and Shakespeare jokes, but then you'd miss all the variety.

In the legislation Democrats are proposing, the enhanced ACA subsidies would last just this year and next, before returning to the original levels laid out in the 2010 health-care law. The COBRA subsidies would last just through this fiscal year.
Yesterday, Ryan staged one of his PowerPoint presentations on the Republican health-care plan, the kind that makes Washington pundits swoon about how wonky and smart he supposedly is. Here's part of what he said:
KELLY: OK. Stand by. We're going to continue this right after the break. We have more.
All three of the judges were appointed by Republican presidents, a fluke that prompted jokes from the Democratic attorneys general arguing the case: At the 4th Circuit, the names of the three judges randomly assigned to each panel are made public on the morning of an oral argument. … When the two Democratic attorneys general first greeted each other Tuesday in the ornate, wood-paneled courtroom, they joked about the luck of the draw. 'Did you pick the panel?' [Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D)] joked, slapping his palm to his forehead in mock disbelief.
-- Related: Beto defeated a sitting congressman, Silvestre Reyes, in a 2012 Democratic primary by attacking him from the right. CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Paul LeBlanc review the campaign: O'Rourke at the time endorsed cuts to defense and domestic spending in the middle and long term, along with seriously considering changes to Social Security and tax laws that would do away with some tax breaks. … O'Rourke attacked Reyes for his failure to vote for the Budget Reform Act of 2011, which created a super committee to develop a deficit reduction plan. … Reyes subsequently ran ads criticizing O'Rourke, saying he wanted to cut Social Security.
This has cast an unflattering light on what had seemed to be Northam's strengths — his calm demeanor, his record of working in the Republican-controlled legislature, even his rural Virginia drawl.
The Blues officials said they feel the administration has made a few positive moves to assist marketplace enrollment, such as making it easier for individual insurers and brokers to directly enroll people in coverage.
Democrats are expected to frequently highlight the memo, which Barr wrote and sent last year. In a letter to Graham released late Monday, Barr noted the memo's analysis was narrow in scope, stressing that he didn't think it was impossible to accuse a president of obstructing justice.
That presented more opportunities for awkwardness: They were seated behind Harris, who vigorously opposed all three. In particular, she conducted a heated grilling of Kavanaugh that thrilled liberals and deeply angered conservatives.
And that's because, as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put it last night in the hallways of the Capitol: [Trump] still remains the most popular Republican in the country, a fact he pointed out wasn't unusual for a former president.
Others, too, were sounding the alarm as Congress tried to overcome significant policy disagreements and general political mistrust of the other side to get this passed.
-- Rupert Murdoch is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump firing Preet Bharara. New York Magazine's Gabriel Sherman reports: Since Election Day, Murdoch, now the executive chairman of Fox News, has personally nudged the network in a more pro-Trump direction. Trump seems to be returning the goodwill … [and] now Murdoch may be poised to reap a much bigger win from a Trump administration action. That's because on Saturday, Trump oversaw the firing of Preet Bharara … whose office is in the middle of a high-profile federal investigation of Fox News. Which is why, for Murdoch, it must be a relief that Bharara's replacement could be an ally. ... Trump's shortlist to replace Bharara includes Marc Mukasey — who just happens to be former Fox News chief Roger Ailes's personal lawyer.… Considering Mukasey's close relationship with Ailes, he would surely come under pressure to recuse himself from the Fox probe if he was appointed by Trump to succeed Bharara[:] 'I have no comment,' Mukasey said when I reached him Sunday evening and asked if he planned to do so, should he get the job.
Seventy percent of Americans were in favor of allowing states to impose Medicaid work requirements on non-disabled adults, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found in June. The idea was backed by 82 percent of Republicans, 77 percent of independents and 56 percent of Democrats.
Liberals at the same time stood down after vowing to fight legislation benefiting the lucrative tax preparation industry last week. They also have yet to follow up their criticism of a recent Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee policy banning strategists who work for those challenging incumbents in primaries, what they've deemed a blacklist.
The Irish attitude to guns is going to be a serious culture shock. First, he'll be far worse off than he would be in rural Oregon. While there will surely be cops closer than 40 miles away, those cops will almost certainly be unarmed. In Ireland, police only carry arms under special circumstances. Most Irish police officers don't even have firearms training.
Stop so-called zombie spending, in which the government funds programs that have had their congressional authorization lapse. By cutting 5 percent of this spending, Trump estimates he could save almost $200 billion over 10 years. (Such spending included funding veterans' medical care, the National Institutes of Health, the FBI, the Federal Election Commission and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, none of which have ceased).
Trump's claims, which The Health 202 reported were exaggerated, infuriated Democrats.
She had intended to support Cory Booker, but now that the New Jersey senator has dropped out of the race, Williams is struggling to choose among the candidates who remain. Not-Donald-Trump is not good enough to get my vote, she said. She is worried that another four years of Trump might mean the end of Obamacare, which reduced her family's monthly insurance costs from $1,500 to $350.
And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.
OOF: The FDA is reversing a decision to award a no-bid $4.2 million grant to a policy center at Duke University headed by former FDA commissioner and current paid board member for Johnson & Johnson Mark McClellan, after several health policy experts had expressed favoritism concerns about the initial no-bid proposal, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.
-- Jim Comey penned a Post op-ed citing the blackface controversies as evidence of why Virginia should take down its Confederate statues. The former FBI director writes: White people designed blackface to keep black people down, to intimidate, mock and stereotype. … Blackface, and our elected leaders' involvement with it, is an important subject, and our country must confront that part of our racist past. Those who did it, or lied about it, shouldn't hold office. Past actions matter. But our present is filled with gigantic bronze embodiments of that same racism. They loom over Virginians every day. If Virginia's leaders want to atone for a troubling legacy, changing state law so Richmond's statues no longer taunt the progress of our country would be a good place to start.
We lost over the last six, seven years with Mexico $100 million. Before NAFTA, we made $40 [billion] to $50 billion.
Twelve of the 13 states that run their own ACA marketplaces have opened special enrollment periods for their residents. The insurance industry urged Trump to do the same for the 38 marketplaces the federal government runs. Trump refused, a decision compounded by the fact that all 14 states that have refused to expand Medicaid are in the federal marketplace, which leaves those states' residents with fewer options.
Working with President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the goal is to transform the federal judiciary.
WALLACE: No. I promise I will get to you in a moment, sir.
The association plans don't have to cover the essential health benefits required of plans purchased by individuals in the ACA marketplaces — something Democrats have been quick to note. Analysts have also warned that they'll cause marketplace premiums to increase by as much as 3.5 percent, by drawing healthy people away from Obamacare plans and into association coverage.

We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.
Similarly, foreign policy, we can predict, is likely to get short shrift in the Democratic primaries. We will find it even more difficult to parse out the candidates' foreign policy views and gauge what we might expect from them. (Remember Bush′s humbler foreign policy?) Here too, we'd do better to assess their values, priorities and approach to big issues than demand specific answers on issues that may be in the rear view mirror by the time they get elected. I'd like to hear answers to these questions:
Trump takes both comments out of context and twists their meaning. Dayton faulted Republicans for refusing to adjust the law, which he said made insurance no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people. Bill Clinton's remark about a crazy system referred to the fact that people who did not qualify for insurance subsidies did not have a way to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.
Klobuchar declared at the rally: I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his.

Congress often let federal funding lapse before 1981, but then the Antideficiency Act of 1870 was enforced. (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)
The White House's strategy is to continue to let McConnell take the lead. Trump is involved only as an encourager, as he was with Cruz on the Thursday phone call. He is not offering or cutting deals, those familiar with the situation said.
KELLY: ... That's never been publicly available.
For most people, the cheaper option is purchasing insurance through the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Since you've lost your job, you may get a hefty government subsidy that will make a policy purchased through Healthcare.gov or your state's health insurance marketplace more affordable. While you're signing up, the online registration portal will also tell you whether you qualify for Medicaid or if children in your household qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Plan. (Learn more about Healthcare.gov policies here.)
We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.
In 2018, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor agreed with Texas and other red states that because Congress had reduced to zero the tax penalty for not complying with the ACA's individual mandate to have health insurance, the mandate was unconstitutional. He then ruled that the entire act must fall, although he stayed his decision, and the ACA remains in effect.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says the conversation around Trump's contentious immigration meeting and remarks has turned into an s-show:
The guests won't be limited to potential presidents — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will be one of the first guests, but so will Adam McKay, the director of Vice and The Big Short. Nonetheless, the long-term plan of Cenk Uygur, the founder of the TYT network and host of its flagship show, is to carry out the most substantive conversations on the planet with candidates.
Democrats' claims that association plans constitute junk insurance aren't necessarily true. That's because the plans are subject to the same requirements currently in place for large employer plans, including requirements to fully cover preventive care and bans on limiting annual and lifetime benefits.
During the presidential campaign, that became a problem for Biden, and he reached out to Hill to express his regret for what she endured.
Barr carefully took Trump's side in the shutdown showdown during his confirmation hearing, stressing that he would like to see a deal reached whereby Congress recognized that it's imperative to have border security and that part of that border security, as a common-sense matter, needs barriers.
Such developments have reduced new infections in the United States to about 40,000 per year, but that figure has plateaued, said Brett Giroir, HHS assistant secretary for health. We really need to have a push.

Watch as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina reads a statement by Nassar, defending himself as a good doctor:
It would be essentially a return to what the individual market looked like before the ACA, where insurers would require applicants to fill out long questionnaires about their medical histories, and make decisions based on people's health and how much to charge, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now we're in the situation where very sick people have gotten insurance, and so changing the rules means taking coverage away from people who genuinely need it.
AHH: The disparities in cancer deaths between black and white Americans have narrowed markedly in the last several years and have disappeared completely for a few age groups, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports, citing a new study by the American Cancer Society.
* TRUMP SELLS OUT HARD-LINERS ON DREAMERS: Trump has not rescinded Obama-era protections for children brought here illegally as children, and the Times reports that immigration hard-liners are furious:
Thursday's meeting seems unlikely to settle such differences. This week, a friend of Ryan's told The Washington Post that Ryan would not demand Trump agree to his specific vision for entitlements but rather would search for common ground on broader questions of principle.
And if people don't like it, we've got have a country, folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.
--The Health 202 often features prolific and punchy tweets from Andy Slavitt, the former UnitedHealth Group executive who helped implement the ACA during the Obama administration. Yesterday, Slavitt launched a bipartisan nonprofit aiming to find consensus on improvements to the U.S. health-care system, called the United States of Care. Rather than lobbying, the group will focus on policy and grass roots work to promote access to affordable care through ways that most Americans can back, Slavitt told his hometown paper the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
At his most recent political rally — in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in late June — he made just a few scattered references to the issue.

Andrew Yang: Yes, the government should put the power in the hands of the consumers. And what I would want is for a consumer to at some point essentially just have one choice. It's like, do you want your data use and protection to be like low, medium or high? And you can change that election at a particular point. And then the tech companies treat you differently based upon which dial you put it to, and you get a different amount of money. So if you put it to high, it's like you can aggressively use my data to some extent and I'll get more money. And then low is like then you have to anonymize it, like you can't really use it for a lot of things, and I get next to no money. So at least then Americans have a basic sense as to what their preference is and how it's expressed, like how the company actually adjusts.
Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.
Congress is trying to fix this problem so that low-income Americans don't drop their health insurance because they can't afford it. The $1.9 trillion stimulus package that is expected to pass by mid-March would forgive these tax bills. (Under a deal reached late Friday, households earning under $150,000 would also be spared taxes on the first $10,200 in unemployment income.)
Glenn walked through several specific proposals in the Trump budget with CRFB Senior Vice President Marc Goldwein, who spotted a number of Obama-era proposals including a $131 billion savings item from equalizing payments for doctor visits in offices vs. hospitals and a $38.5 billion reduction in payments for bad debts.

By May, the CBO had incorporated this analysis in its estimates. The impact of the mandate was downgraded even further, to just 2 million fewer insured in 2019 — and 8 million by the end of the decade. So that's a 38 percent reduction from the November 2017 report and a drop of 50 percent from the report that caused such a stir a year earlier. (Note: we have updated this chart to reflect the July report that more closely modeled the impact of just the mandate.)
On Monday, as Trump arrived in India, violence broke out in Delhi between supporters and opponents of [Modi's] controversial new citizenship law. Critics say the law is unconstitutional and discriminates against Muslims. … [Violence continued today], police told local media that the death toll from Monday's violence had climbed to seven, including one police officer. More than 100 people were injured, according to media reports. Heavy police presence in the affected areas failed to stem the violence. … Home Minister Amit Shah, Modi's second-in-command, chaired a meeting with top officials and the Delhi state leadership. The government ruled out calling the army for assistance and said there were adequate security forces on the ground. …

-- A federal judge ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional and called for the agency to be eliminated. Renae Merle reports: Senior U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska threw out the bureau's lawsuit against a New Jersey company that the bureau alleged had scammed former NFL players and 9/11 emergency medical workers out of millions of dollars. Preska's ruling contradicts a decision by a U.S. appeals court on the issue this year and increases the likelihood that the CFPB's constitutionality could become fodder for the Supreme Court. Noting that the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was not binding in New York, Preska said she 'respectfully' disagreed.

Some leading House Republicans are also wary of Trump's approach. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) urged Trump to hold off on pushing for a court-ordered destruction of the ACA, advice the president ignored, according to a senior Republican official who spoke to The Washington Post earlier this week on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the conversation.
The technological backbone to much of the relief — including the distribution of relief checks and the unemployment insurance system — requires knowledge of a software programming language not widely used in decades.

A decline in the death rate from cancer is the single largest driver of the small increase in life expectancy, the CDC reported, Joel writes. Five of the other nine leading causes of death also showed declines in death rates, including the top cause, heart disease, as well as unintentional injuries (which includes overdoses), chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Two more, diabetes and kidney disease, were essentially unchanged. Deaths from suicide and influenza/pneumonia increased.
Fourth, Biden explained on ABC that he was moving forward with his vice-presidential selection process (graciously telling Sanders what he was doing, a remarkable courtesy considering Sanders's refusal to drop his futile campaign) and preparing his party for a possible virtual convention. The idea of holding a convention is going to be necessary, but we may not be able to put 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people in one place, he said. He also made a pitch to secure our election process whether by mail or other means. [How] are we going to do that? How are we going to make it available to everybody? In each of these areas, Biden argued that we should never, never let our democracy take second fiddle. ... [We] can both have a democracy and elections and at the same time protect the public health. Presidents plan ahead to secure our democracy; they don't view a crisis as an opportunity to seize power or imperil democracy.
Only a fraction of the total $1.5 trillion in economic gains Tenney mentioned would be taxable, so it's inaccurate to say the cost of the tax cut has been offset already. Tenney's interviewers at WUTQ-FM quickly jumped on her claim and pressed her to explain. In the end, she shifted somewhat, from saying the tax cuts had paid for themselves in six months to saying in the end, the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves.
Her first foray got off to a rocky start: Stumping for her mother in New Hampshire, she mischaracterized Bernie Sanders's health-care plan, saying he wanted to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare and dismantle private insurance.

Ocasio-Cortez has used her deceased father's Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012 … But The Post could find little indication she continues to live there. … On Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona. … 'Come downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,' the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.

But the law's tax increases on the rich largely remain intact. Penalties for violating the individual mandate accounted for about $2 billion annually of the $40 billion raised under Obamacare through new taxes. The biggest tax passed under the Affordable Care Act, the one on investment income, remains in place, and nearly 100 percent of it was paid by Americans in the top income bracket.
I will be the first to acknowledge that ideas like the wealth tax or putting workers on boards are easier to understand and more apt to energize the political base than changing the tax treatment for unrealized capital gains or adjusting the fiduciary duties of corporate directors. But the reason our government has become as dysfunctional as it has is because the process of running for office has become totally divorced from the process of governing — think Donald Trump and the border wall that he has insisted Mexico is going to pay for.

On Tuesday, Chinese officials declared the China leg of the WHO probe complete and called for its scope to be expanded globally.
The platform includes planks on healthcare, national security, regulatory reform and reducing poverty.

I feel pressure, yes, I do: I feel pressure to say no, he said. They're overwhelmingly, resoundingly saying, 'Thank you for being a no.' 
-- CNN, Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her, by Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield: Interviews with mothers who've lost children and with those who spy on anti-vaccination groups, reveal a tactic employed by anti-vaxers: When a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed, or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those. Nothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers. … Jill Promoli, who lives outside Toronto, lost her son to flu. She believes the anti-vaxers are trying to silence the very people who can make the strongest argument for vaccinations: those whose children died of vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Del. Christopher K. Peace (R-Hanover) is in the hopeful camp, calling reaction to his Medicaid vote largely positive. Same goes for Del. Bob Thomas (R-Stafford), who said he has heard grumbling from less than 10 constituents. But one person unhappy with his vote, former Stafford supervisor Paul Milde, announced Thursday that he would challenge Thomas for the nomination next year.
Today's disappointing decision by the Supreme Court only prolongs and worsens the uncertainty and fear that Republicans' anti-health care agenda is inflicting on American families, Pelosi said in a statement, adding that the Trump Administration and its GOP allies have engaged in an outrageous sabotage campaign to systematically destroy protections for the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions as well as every last benefit and protection provided by the Affordable Care Act.
At the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates drug policy across the government, only three people are still working out of a staff of about 80, our colleagues write. The office is largely responsible for developing drug policy and strategy, and it administers two grant programs. One sends money to state and local law enforcement agencies in 'high-intensity drug-trafficking areas.' The other helps support community groups working to curb youth substance abuse. One of the three people still working at the office is the agency's director, James Caroll, who was confirmed by the Senate last week.
9:43 a.m.: Graham, new Judiciary Committee chairman, opens the hearing with a joke
The Ninth Annual Congressional Women's Softball Game is tonight.
The hardest job for the C.B.O. is estimating the effects of the MacArthur Amendment, which allows states to waive several insurance regulations … the office's economists must … estimate how many states will decide to pursue the waivers, how many people live in those states, and which rules they will choose to waive … Some experts have said the waivers will be unpopular, and only a few states will pursue them. Others have argued that they are likely to become widespread. Our panel estimated a wide range of effects, saying as few as 10 percent of Americans would be affected or as many as half.
Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said leaders proposed gradually reducing federal payments to states that accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA. That would give recipients more time to ease out of the program and into purchasing coverage on their own or through an employer rather than under the House bill.
Have we mentioned the vote-a-rama? Wednesday at 5 p.m. (moved from 11 a.m.), a voting blitz in which legislators could offer a parade of amendments relating to the repeal of Obamacare. The vote-a-rama was set to potentially include more than 100 amendments. The vote-a-rama, it was said, could go on all night.
Expand programs such as Project Exile, a federal program started in Virginia in 1997 that locked up criminals possessing illegal guns for years in federal prisons far from their homes. (See above.)
7. Are there Republicans who might vote with Democrats?
The fierce competitors are striking an unusual pact that could sharply boost the supply of the newly authorized vaccine, senior administration officials told Laurie McGinley and Christopher Rowland.
In effect, Sanders split the difference, staying on the ballot to gather delegates and influence the party but formally ending his campaign with warm words about Biden. Sanders's relationship with Biden was always better than his rapport with Clinton, and Sanders always felt that Biden had a personal commitment to working-class voters whose standard Sanders saw himself as lifting.
ICYMI: One of the wilder stories of 2019 is this scoop by WaPo's John Hudson, which details a mysterious incident in Spain that potentially threatened to derail Trump's talks with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un prior to their meeting in Vietnam.
This inequity has existed since the payroll tax was introduced. It turns the payroll tax from a flat tax — one in which everyone pays the same share of their income — into a wildly regressive one in a world where most wealthy people have arranged to receive most of their income in the form of dividends and capital gains. Obamacare was financed by partially closing this glaring loophole, and if Obamacare is repealed, it will be because Republicans insist on reopening it. Zero-sum game.
McConnell offered little hope that bipartisan cooperation is likely for the GOP's major goals; he said health care and tax reform, another legislative priority, are likely to pass along sharply party-line votes.
O'Rourke dove into Spanish in his opening answer. We have to include every individual in the success of this economy. But if we want to do that, we need to include everyone in our democracy, O'Rourke said, repeating his words in Spanish.
The next scheduled trial will take place in Summit and Cuyahoga counties in Ohio on Nov. 9.
As my colleagues Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report that Wray told the committee domestic terrorism has roughly doubled over the past year. The FBI director testified in September that the number of such cases was about 1,000. By the end of 2020, there were about 1,400 such cases, and after Jan. 6 the figure ballooned again, the director said.
The differing ideas on health-care reflect not only contrasts in policy but sensitivities to opposite ends of the political spectrum, with some concerned about an electoral backlash from centrist or left-leaning voters who oppose major changes to Obamacare and others worried that a less aggressive assault on the ACA will leave right-leaning opponents of the law dispirited.

Comeback kidders: The year in redo, Part 1
GOP senators have continued to weigh the potential testimony of John Bolton following new reporting on Jan. 26 about his conversations with President Trump. (The Washington Post)
As Trump continues to win Republican delegates, Romney delivers an unusually potent speech attacking his candidacy.
When George W. Bush was elected, he failed to reinstate the rule during his eight years in office. My former White House colleague Yuval Levin recently wrote that the reinstatement effort was abandoned in the spring of 2006, in a deputies-level policy gathering that was one of the most contentious meetings I ever witnessed in government.
Every Democratic campaign had a similar reaction, and it's easy to see why. In 2018, the national exit poll found that 41 percent of voters considered health care the most important issue facing the country. Seventy-five percent of those voters picked Democrats. The year-long fight against repealing the ACA unified Democrats like no issue since then, and the administration's endorsement of the new lawsuit could unify them again.
The chief justice issued a rare rebuke of a sitting member of Congress, chastising the Senate's top Democrat for saying at a rally outside the Supreme Court that Trump's two nominees to the court would pay the price if they vote against abortion rights. Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous, Roberts said. All members of the court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter. Schumer, speaking as the Supreme Court heard arguments in an important abortion case from Louisiana, called out Brett M. Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch by name: I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
The twelve states that have not expanded Medicaid will see even more incentives from the federal government to do so. At least 4 million Americans who would otherwise be eligible for expanded Medicaid live in those dozen holdout states, with nearly a third of them in Texas. Under the stimulus bill, the government would increase its Medicaid contribution by 5 percent to states that expand the program. At least 4 million Americans who would otherwise be eligible for expanded Medicaid live in those dozen holdout states, with nearly a third of them in Texas. Under the stimulus bill, the government would increase its Medicaid contribution by 5 percent to states that expand the program.
The lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, led by Texas and other Republican-led states, seeks to overturn the entire law because Congress erased its penalty for lacking health coverage. That penalty is the basis for which the Supreme Court upheld the ACA as constitutional back in 2012.
Let's concede that higher deficits are one problem that can't be blamed on President Trump. Since the 1970s and 1980s, Democrats and Republicans alike have evaded the hard questions required to balance the budget.
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
Bigger picture, though, Klobuchar is running as a pragmatic dealmaker while Warren is running as an ideological street brawler. Klobuchar said yesterday that she was the only candidate who raised her hand during Friday night's debate when the moderator asked whether anyone on stage worries that a democratic socialist couldn't win the general election. [In fact, Steyer did as well.] She also criticized the free college for all and Medicare-for-all plans that Warren and Sanders advocate, and she warned voters not to fall for bumper sticker slogans, an apparent reference to Buttigieg.
People who are doing interesting things are way beyond what Medicare envisioned, Cavanaugh said. There's lots of ways in which the Medicare billing rules don't jibe with the future of medicine.
OOF: In a call with donors last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) directly blamed his party's midterm losses in the House on the issue of health care. He specifically called out the Republican effort to roll back protections for people with preexisting conditions, our Post colleague Mike DeBonis reports.
Booker delivered an at times rambling but passionate explanation for why the data — which Barr acknowledged he had not reviewed — showed that the system was rife with racial bias that was hurting communities, appealing to Barr to reconsider his past views, and pleading with Barr to at least commission a study to understand why liberals and conservatives alike had determined that the system needed to change.
In the Texas Monthly interview, as reporter Erica Grieder noted, Cruz diverted a question about whether he could back Trump by saying he would support a hypothetical candidate who met his standards — who will fight to reduce the burdens of the federal government on small businesses, which create two-thirds of all new jobs; who will reduce taxes and dramatically simplify the tax code; who will repeal Obamacare; who will protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights — religious liberty, the Second Amendment, the Tenth Amendment — and keep our country safe.
Which brings us back to Biden's commitment. On Thursday night, he promised not only that every adult American would be able to sign up for a vaccine by May 1 but that there would be a comprehensive online tool for them to do so. And maybe there will be; Biden has already set a pattern of beating his own (often generous) benchmarks for action. Or maybe Biden will be the third president in a row to promise a website that addresses a critical health concern but who fails to do so.
Then there are the ongoing actions by states to restrict abortions in various ways, a trend that has been going strong for several years and continued in 2017. Last year, 19 states adopted 63 new restrictions on abortion rights and access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group.
The 'no' or change it to a talking filibuster camp: This group includes Manchin and other moderate Democrats, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.). But there are other Democrats who might stall momentum entirely on the issue.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is set to testify before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies on Wednesday.
Once students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. Kaytlin Roholt graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley during the Gorsuch nomination, and now practices at Jones Day and is a member of the steering committee of the Federalist Society's D.C. chapter for young lawyers. Regardless of where I am, I know that a Federalist Society event is a place where I can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. What we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. Panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. Together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.
I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so. … The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country. … When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism …

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to members of Parliament in the House of Commons in London on March 20. (Reuters)
The president did engage personally on health care earlier in the year, courting groups of lawmakers in the Oval Office and making rounds of calls, eventually claiming partial credit when a version of the legislation passed the House. But those overtures to reticent lawmakers over Diet Cokes have largely faded as Senate Republicans have labored to pass their version of the bill, long the party's signature pledge to its base.
ProPublica's investigation focused on Evenflo, a company labeled their booster seats as SIDE IMPACT TESTED without revealing that there was no regulation it needed to follow to indicate that. In the company's own tests, child dummies were tossed from the seats with the side impact feature, according to video of the tests obtained by ProPublica.
So the reporter said to me the other day, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?
The House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations holds a hearing on how the Veterans Affairs Department supports survivors of military sexual trauma on Feb. 5.
It's time that politicians recognize birth control as health care and that women, in consultation with doctors, decide what contraception we receive — not our employers, Wen said in a statement.
The bottom line is, if we don't clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists, said Hickenlooper, a former small-business owner.
If the reaction seems mild, that could be a triumph of messaging. House Republicans have billed expansion as conservative Medicaid reform since their plan would impose work requirements on recipients — something the Trump administration has supported elsewhere. (Critics on the right say the requirements amount to a nonbinding work suggestion.)
Asked why the police force was so much whiter than the city itself, he replied:
At her father's 1992 nominating convention, a campaign aide suggested that Chelsea, then 12, introduce her dad after the biographical video with a simple: Ladies and gentleman, the next president of the United States, my dad, Bill Clinton. But Hillary Clinton nixed the idea to avoid putting pressure on her daughter, the New Yorker magazine reported at the time.
Kathleen Sebelius, who was secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration, said that in the first few years after the law's implementation, there was not tangible evidence of what this was going to look like.
Biden has become increasingly critical of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) for saying Obamacare should be replaced with Medicare-for-all.
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
OOF: The shutdown is also putting the nation's food safety at risk, as the furloughing of hundreds of employees at the Food and Drug Administration means food inspections have been sharply reduced.
Among others, I have suggested that mass voter registration, litigation against voter suppression laws and sophisticated digital operations should be at the top of Bloomberg's spending list. However, when it comes to ads, the point should not be to taunt Trump but to mobilize voters and remind those who voted for him in 2016 why they cannot do so again.
Aides and advisers to Trump say it's clear that he will need support from some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, to move parts of his agenda forward beyond tax reform.
Capitol Police say they have intelligence about possible plot by militia to breach Capitol on March 4, a date that some QAnon followers falsely claim will mark Trump's return to the White House, Felicia Sonmez reports.

We change 'em, as if we were changing our socks!
The GOP denounced Schumer and criticized the media for what they said was a lack of outrage, Robert Barnes and Colby Itkowitz report. Democrats demanded to know why Roberts had not spoken out last week when Trump singled out liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor for criticism, or why he did not defend the federal judge Trump denounced for her oversight of the trial of the president's friend Roger Stone. The episode underscored the partisan politics that have engulfed the fight over the judiciary, which is supposed to be the nonpartisan branch of the government.
The novel coronavirus has leveled the American economy and has businesses of all sizes tightening their belts. Much of that pain is getting passed on to workers as businesses are forced to close because of public health orders or cut costs through layoffs and furloughs. Here's everything you need to know if you've lost your job or been furloughed because of the spread of covid-19.
— A bipartisan group of senators working on legislation to address surprise medical bills has asked health-care providers and insurers for information about how states laws on billing practices, whether hospitals should play a role in tackling surprise medical bills and how much insurers pay for out-of-network care.
Despite a number of payment experiments tried by CMS over the past decade, physicians still earn the most through the traditional fee-for-service method in which they're compensated for each individual service. Nearly 60 percent of doctors in a 2017 AMA survey reported their practices had received some revenue from a value-based payment model, but these alternative payments comprised only 17 percent of their profit.
Ryan also spent time focused on poverty issues, traveling with Robert L. Woodson, a former civil rights activist who founded a center aimed at transforming troubled communities. But Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) said that as much as he'd like to believe Ryan was sincere, he couldn't point to anything concrete Ryan had achieved on behalf of communities of color.
But neither the White House nor Republicans in Congress have offered a new plan to replace the comprehensive Obama-era law, which was passed nearly a decade ago and has grown in popularity since Trump was elected, Toluse and Seung Min add.
But the ACLU opposes the plan, with spokeswoman Manar Waheed saying in a statement, A new domestic terrorism statue should be off the table.
Conversations with the Post Editorial Board:
Some doubt a flurry of executive orders and new regulations would have any immediate effect on consumers' pocketbooks. What is clear is that the approach, which includes White House support for a bipartisan Senate bill to cap Medicare drug price increases, is putting congressional Republicans in a tough spot: Embrace Trump's agenda and abandon conservative precepts about interference in the marketplace, or buck the president on one of his top priorities.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
Is illegal immigration a crime?: About half of the candidates raised their hands when moderators asked whether they would they change the law to decriminalize illegal immigration.
Trump wanted a parade. He just might get one:
Breaking character is strictly forbidden in any Dungeons & Dragons game. (If it weren't, we'd briefly note that #GOPDnD began trending earlier this month after tweets by podcaster James D'Amato and has since evolved into a viral, extremely elaborate parody of the young Trump administration's stumbles.)
The proof of all this is the fact that this covid relief bill will pass, because it's the only thing Democrats can do without a supermajority. It's a vital, popular bill that could have been done in cooperation with Republicans had they wanted, but instead they've decided to oppose it. Which is their right, but it also shows how a simple majority should be the requirement for more legislating — which can only happen if the filibuster is eliminated.
— A bipartisan pair of lawmakers is calling on federal regulators to scrutinize the pending $74 billion merger of pharmaceutical giants Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb to understand the impact on industry and consumers.
The difficulty with this scale of spending is not that it helps the poor at the expense of the wealthy. The problem is that it helps the present at the expense of the future. The level of liabilities the federal government is incurring will eventually impose a burden of debt servicing that crowds out a lot of discretionary spending. But there seems to be a cheerful, bipartisan agreement to ignore this problem. And it probably should be ignored during an economic crisis anyway.
Pressed on his incorrect assertion that he had the largest margin of victory in the electoral college since President Ronald Reagan, Trump blamed faulty facts.
Trump reprised the central ­arguments of his candidacy and harshly condemned the condition of the country he now commands. He said communities had fallen into disrepair with rampant crime, chronic poverty, broken schools, stolen wealth and rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones.
It will be done through CMS's innovation center, a new department created under the Affordable Care Act to test better models of paying providers. The center will offer four new payment options – and consider a fifth – in which primary care doctors and larger practices would collect per-visit fees and monthly payments based on their volume of patients, instead of separately billing Medicare for every separate test, exam or procedure.
— Jan. 25, interview with ABC News
Results from the first nine months of 2019 suggest that the individual market remains profitable and stable despite the effective repeal of the individual mandate, the KFF analysis reads. Continued modest growth in claims costs and a decrease in hospitalizations through the third quarter of 2019 indicate that the repeal of the individual mandate penalty and expansion of short-term insurance plans did not leave the individual market significantly less healthy.

One committee member has signaled he plans to ask Barr about his past interactions with politically active conservative organizations that accept anonymous donations.
At the other end of the spectrum are conservative senators such as Rand Paul (R-Ky.) who want to see a more forceful repeal than many of his GOP colleagues. I'm still open-minded. I do want to vote for a repeal bill, said Paul, sounding a noncommittal note.

Just as big business has suffered from getting too cozy with the Republican establishment, the Republican establishment has suffered from getting too cozy with big business — at least as measured by the 13 million voters who showed up this year to vote for Donald Trump as the party's presidential nominee.
180 million people in America get their insurance through an employer-based plan and Medicare X gives people the opportunity to decide whether they want to stay on that plan, Bennet told Marianne. Some of the other plans take away insurance from those 180 million.
Other members of Congress are more explicit in their refusals to participate in more Obamacare repeal-and-replace exercises – an effort bound to be fruitless partly due to a Democrat-led House.

Speaking of Cruz, Lee, Paul and Johnson, Trump said on Fox News: It's not that they're opposed. They'd like to get certain changes.
That kind of reform would save money (and give us better drugs) in the long run, but relief is needed now. While drug price negotiations — as Trump once recognized — can help, they may not always suffice. For instance, if only one drug is available to treat a particular disease, the firm that owns the patent holds all the cards in negotiations, and it can walk from the bargaining table. In those situations, we need additional tools to lower prices while ensuring that patients have access to all necessary medications.
Dozens of patients told an FDA advisory panel to suggest long-term research or bans or restrictions on products linked to serious complications, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
Do not throw a lavish state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping, as Obama did last year, and instead buy Jinping a double-size Big Mac and tell him, We got to get down to work. (Trump didn't give Xi a state dinner, but he hosted him for a dinner at Mar-a-Lago. He also took part in a state dinner thrown by Xi in China.)
His 50-minute speech in Miami was a recitation of the law's accomplishments, a repudiation of persistent Republican efforts to tear it down and a road map for refining the law attached to his name — Obamacare — after his tenure in the White House. Coming less than two weeks before the fourth enrollment season begins on Nov. 1 in ACA marketplaces, his remarks also were an attempt to frame the law's benefits as the administration will face a fresh test of the popularity of the health plans the law created.
But, at least in the case of Indiana, the rulings haven't always gone their way.
We need an education in how to be better human beings.
Moreover, his move hurts longtime trading partners, especially Canada, which is the biggest source of imported steel, followed by Brazil and South Korea. The notion that we are seeking NAFTA adjustments while slapping tariffs on Canada exemplifies the administration's incoherence. And as we struggle to reassure South Korea that our alliance is strong and will rebuff any threat from North Korea, our tariffs send the opposite message.
There is no question that race played an important part in the 2016 election and that for many Trump voters, cultural identity was a more significant factor than economic self-interest. It is otherwise impossible to explain why so many working-class whites supported Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, a policy that benefited them above all.
— The National Institutes of Health unveiled an outline yesterday on how it plans to spend $500 million from Congress to address the opioid crisis. The plan includes developing new medications to treat addiction, making current treatments more effective, improving overdose-reversing medications and developing new nonaddictive pain drugs and treatments, according to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
They looked on in chagrin as his administration reinstated the Mexico City policy (banning foreign nongovernmental organizations who get U.S. family-planning assistance from performing or promoting abortions), made it easier for employers to refuse to cover birth control for workers and nominated two Supreme Court justices who recently sided with allowing a restrictive Louisiana abortion law to go into effect.
RUBIO: As few as possible. The Second Amendment, as I've said before, is not a suggestion. It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families. It is a right that -- it is the Second Amendment for a reason.
The FDA rightly observed that young people prefer these cheap, cartridge-based e-cigarettes that deliver a jolt of nicotine because the devices look appealing — many resemble a USB drive — and are easily concealed, Gottlieb writes. But policymakers struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing preferences of young people, and the new rules appear to have overlooked different devices that are gaining popularity with kids.
-- A small team of FBI agents spent years trying to solve a stubborn mystery – whether officials from Saudi Arabia were involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. A team of ProPublica and NYT Magazine reporters tell their story: The FBI has disputed the idea that foreign-policy considerations significantly influenced its investigation. In interviews, current and former bureau officials and federal prosecutors insisted to us that they never would have hesitated to pursue any Saudi who could have been solidly linked to the 9/11 plot … But others who worked on the matter, including some at the FBI's highest levels, say that the United States' complex and often-troubled relationship with the Saudi regime was an unavoidable fact throughout their investigations. Even as the Saudi authorities became more cooperative with the United States in fighting al-Qaida after 2003, they were minimally and grudgingly helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry. According to current and former officials, requests for assistance that might rattle the Saudi security agencies were frequently balanced against FBI and CIA needs for Saudi help against continuing terror threats.
He's a petulant child, Smith said. I mean I don't know how else to describe the man. He says and does things without thinking about their implications to America, the American people, our standing in the world. You know the only thing he kind of thinks about is dominating the news cycle to make sure he's on the front page of your newspaper.
(Washington Post reporters have found no evidence that Trump met with the Russians during this meeting at Trump Tower. The president fired back at Bannon on Wednesday, saying in a statement that Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.)
11:05 a.m.: Barr says its 'ludicrous' to allege his comments on Mueller were a bid to get attorney general job
Even if you accept that Schumer wasn't talking about a more nefarious threat, he was still talking about some kind of retribution or response. He was also deriding sitting justices as if they were his defined political opponents. His allies may sympathize with that, and perhaps we're past the moment where Supreme Court justices will be viewed as anything other than political pawns. But that's an extraordinary state of affairs.
That is corruption, pure and simple, said Warren, going to a favorite tag line.
At this point, it is doubtful that either party wants to be involved with big business, said Vin Weber, a former member of the Republican House leadership who now lobbies for corporate clients.
It's important to remember that these rates are what companies have requested, and not necessarily what will be approved, Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer, Jr. said in a statement. There will be a thorough review of all the filings. As in years past, we may require changes.
Much of this was driven by President Trump himself. There was a particularly sizable spike in coverage on Oct. 13, when the president announced he was cutting off extra cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers, and on Oct. 18, when he tweeted opposition to the bipartisan plan from Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to fund them again.
After ticking though his priorities on health care and education — many of the same ideas he ran on in 2016 — Sanders eventually answered the question.
The House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions holds a hearing on surprise billing.
One of the Republicans argued that Trump holds political sway over Cruz and Johnson. The former is up for reelection in 2018 and is hoping to avoid a serious primary challenge; the latter unexpectedly won a second term last fall thanks to Trump's strong showing in Wisconsin.
Over the past 10 years or so, there's been a significant evolution in TV graphics, said Peter Blangiforti, Fox News's senior vice president of broadcast and media technology.

Two weeks ago, the CDC began notifying staffers and officials abroad about its plan to downsize these activities, because officials assume there will be no new resources, a senior government official told Lena. The official said notice is being given to CDC country directors as the very first phase of a transition, adding that there is a need for forward planning to accommodate longer advance notice for staffers and for leases and property agreements.

He must know something beyond what's on Breitbart, Ingraham said.
Chaotic scenes similar to this one have become a new normal at Republican town hall events across the United States, reminiscent of the tea party movement that intensified following Obama's election in 2008. But now it's the Republicans who are enduring protests, sharp rebukes and emotional questions about what they see as a sharp turn in governance as well as the House and Senate's willingness to check the White House, The Washington Post's Dan Zak and Terence Samuel wrote this year.
Yet differences are emerging among Capitol Hill Democrats over how to expand coverage, part of a larger debate roiling the party as 2020 candidates, many of them senators, and a new class of freshmen House Democrats move the party left not only on health care but also on the environment.
Chafin earned a bachelor's degree from East Tennessee State University, a school close enough to home that he could fulfill his obligations to the family farm by returning home most weekends, his biography said.
At the same time, the fractious party failed to agree on other big ideas, like how to replace Obamacare, reform immigration laws and overhaul the tax code. So, by process of elimination, Ryan's idea became the Republican idea, the best evidence that — in Ryan's words — the GOP is a proposition party, not just an opposition party.
The regulation has fueled this fierce debate: Will exposing the prices of medical procedures such as surgeries or scans ultimately cause hospitals to lower those prices?
Following this, the president-elect will meet with Andrew MacKenzie -- M-A-C-K-E-N-Z-I-E; Jacques Nasser, that first name is J-A-C-Q-U-E-S, last name N-A-S-S-E-R; and Mr. Geoff Healy, G-E-O-F-F H-E-A-L-Y, from BHP Billiton, B-I-L-L-I-T-O-N, the world's largest mining company.

This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?
Outnumbered Norsemen fall prey to wildlife (Beverley Sharp, Montgomery, Ala.)
President Trump pointed to such a move at the National Prayer Breakfast last week, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports, telling religious leaders that such faith-based agencies would still be able to get federal funding to help vulnerable children find their forever families while following their deeply held beliefs.
Did Sen. Kamala Harris really say she listened to Snoop Dogg and Tupac when she smoked marijuana in the '80s? Not really:
Potential changes to EHBs are prompting heavy pushback from many health-care advocates, who are loath to see reduced benefits in the plans available to Americans — especially those who don't have access to employer-sponsored coverage.
-- State attorneys general and former DOJ officials are raising questions about the department's decision to issue a legal opinion long sought by GOP megadonor and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. The Democratic attorneys general of Pennsylvania and New Jersey expressed concern in a letter to DOJ leaders that the opinion, which could further restrict Internet gambling, followed substantial lobbying by outside groups.

Jamrozy opened up. He told her that he had been molested as a boy and felt alone. He also apologized for the hostility.
Maureen Haines, 33, started the Facebook page agitating for a town hall out of frustration that Brat – who she voted for – seemed to be inaccessible. In 2015, she was surprised by an event where questions to Brat had to go through a staffer. In 2016, she couldn't find any Brat events open to the general public.
TRUMP: And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website.
But the biggest difference-maker was President Trump. Hillary was polarizing on our side, Welch said in an interview. Trump is unifying on our side.
Barr sought to get ahead of some of those questions late Monday night, writing a letter to Graham that offered much more insight into his thought process in preparing the document, and detailing exactly with whom he discussed it.
There is a family connection to Republican establishment politics and service in the administration of George W. Bush. There is a glittery Ivy League résumé — Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law — along with a Marshall scholarship to Oxford. There is a partnership at one of Washington's top litigation law firms and a string of successful cases.

Stanley's hospital bill sped to Northam's desk. He chose to sign it — his first as governor — at the hospital, a gesture bound to create more attention and goodwill. He invited Stanley to fly there with him — just days after sending a Valentine's greeting to Stanley — and only Stanley — on the Senate floor.
— The FDA is looking into nearly three dozen reports of e-cigarette users having seizures, although the agency stressed it's not sure whether there is a direct relationship.
Several of these candidates have this stuff done real early in the process. But I think we are tracking well ahead of where -- where some administrations have in the past. In most cases, all that paperwork has cleared. And at least for all the candidates this week, all of the candidates that are going up in front have been -- have been -- all of their paperwork has been in and submitted.
But, as we noted, the individual market is just one-seventh the size, with employer-provided plans (half of Americans), Medicare and Medicaid unaffected by the provision. (Medicaid, as we have reported, would face steep cuts in funds.)

After a 12-day visit, a World Health Organization mission to Wuhan is unlikely to satisfy U.S. officials who are demanding transparency from China or critics who have raised questions about whether the WHO is equipped to investigate the pandemic's origins, Gerry Shih and Emily Rauhala report.
Two weeks ago, a Pew Research Center poll showed, for the first time, that a majority of Americans liked Obamacare (54 percent) vs. 43 percent who disliked it. This is a law that for years had more opposition than support.

Supporters of the plan noted that stimulus payments approved by Congress last spring and in December also did not go out automatically to non-filers but are still viewed by many economists as both a political and economic success. Some research has found the stimulus payments dramatically staved off poverty as the economy wobbled under the weight of the coronavirus.
-- America is drowning in red ink: The federal budget deficit will eclipse $1 trillion in 2020, the Congressional Budget Office said, and the 13-figure shortfall is largely due to the Trump tax cuts. Jeff Stein reports: A combination of the 2017 tax cuts and a surge in new spending has pushed the deficit wider. This year would mark the first time since 2012 that the deficit breached $1 trillion, a threshold that has alarmed some budget experts because deficits typically contract — not expand — during periods of sustained economic growth. Overall, the CBO projected that the federal government will spend $4.6 trillion in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 and bring in $3.6 trillion in tax revenue. … The CBO also projected the economy would grow by 2.2 percent in 2020, which represents a healthy clip but falls short of the 3 percent target set by the Trump administration. The projections were contained in the CBO's annual budget and economic outlook.
If you want to build the political support for [Medicare-for-all], politically this is a time for conversation and education on those issues, Dach said. It's not a time where those things are going to pass. This is going to take time.
In other words, the three GOP seats that Republicans are worried about look very dicey for them, while Democrats are seeing worrisome seats move closer to them. With so many seats to defend and so many of those in red states, Democrats will have a steep climb to pick up the net-two seats needed to win the majority. Nevertheless, it is quite possible Democrats will stay even at 49 seats or perhaps net one seat (forcing Vice President Pence to be there to break tie after tie). Virtually no one on either side would have predicted that last year.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving the Trump administration:
RUBIO: ... because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you've made a center issue. Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue. And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger. And I said that repeatedly at the time.
It broke my heart that I didn't go and vote, but I just couldn't switch to Hillary's side from Bernie's side, she said.
Pelosi appears to remain skeptical as congressional Democrats have introduced a range of Medicare-for-all plans, without unifying support behind any one proposal or a deep understanding of what all the proposals would encompass, as Health 202 wrote last month.
-- L.B. Jamieson, 49, sells cement trucks and hates Obamacare. She considers herself an independent, backs Handel and suggests she will be deeply disillusioned if congressional Republicans do nothing to get rid of the law. I have to pay a $40 co-pay just to see a doctor, the Republican said. It's not affordable.… I'd rather pay the fine.
SPICER: Can you -- Alexis, can you -- in terms of what?
But perhaps the greatest threat to the U.S. economy is the deterioration in the rule of law that has become a hallmark of the Trump presidency and now lies at the heart of the unfolding impeachment process.
In October, Boucher had the branches taken away in portable dumpsters, but when more appeared, he burned the woodpiles. Paul then made another branch pile where the previous ones were, per the report. But Paul's Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor called the debris allegations a false narrative.
President Trump attacked the Affordable Care Act as horrible, no-good, and said the Republicans would come up with a plan that is far better. (Reuters)
The Iowa Democratic Party's chairman was talking about the disastrous caucuses when his lectern's sign fell, prompting chatter that this was perhaps a metaphor:
We spoke around the time Iran launched ballistic missiles toward two bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops but before the Pentagon confirmed the strikes and gave word that there were no casualties. I don't know if this goes any further, Bloomberg said. I don't know what comes out of this. I can't read the tea leaves to know about tomorrow. But I do know that if you're making irresponsible decisions, the likelihood of bad and even calamitous results grows.
The remark came as Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) pressed Barr on just how much independence the attorney general nominee would give Mueller, if confirmed.
-- Trump shifted blame for his health care collapse to the right on Sunday, shifting culpability to conservative interest groups and Freedom Caucus members after initially faulting Democrats. Sean Sullivan, John Wagner and Amber Phillips report: His attack [starting with a Sunday morning tweet], marked a new turn in the increasingly troubled relationship between the White House and a divided GOP still adjusting to its unorthodox standard-bearer. And the tweet served as a warning shot, with battles still to come on issues such as taxes and infrastructure that threaten to further expose Republican fractures, that Trump will not hesitate to apply public pressure on those in his party he views as standing in the way.
We are likely to file a broader challenge to the Executive Order in the coming days, and we'll likely seek temporary relief, Lee Gelernt, a senior lawyer at the ACLU's national office and one of the main lawyers on the case, told me this morning.
Tim Miller, the former spokesman for the Republican National Committee and communications director for Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign who has emerged as a Trump critic, blasted Blackburn for her tweet about Vindman:
Like the conservative health-care bill passed last month by the House, the Senate's version would end that insurance mandate in 2020. The House's legislation would replace the mandate with a subtler form of encouragement for people to keep buying insurance — permission for health plans to charge customers 30 percent more for a year if they have let their coverage lapse.
A Democratic senator engaged in this back-and-forth with the RNC chairwoman after a clash over humanitarian aid caused violence in Venezuela:

Shortly after, West, back on Twitter after a long hiatus, chimed in:
Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.
But by handing Sanders two strong performances, Iowa and New Hampshire have lent momentum to him at precisely the moment when conscientious vetters should have put a stop to the Sanders fantasy.
Pelosi states in broad, certain terms that 7 million veterans will lose premium tax credits for themselves and their dependents under the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. But in reality, it's not so certain. Republicans have stressed that they want current protections to remain, even if Obamacare is repealed; it's an issue only because of the parliamentary tactics they have chosen. They're now taking steps to turn the current IRS protections into law.
Where do I come up with all of this money to pay them back during the pandemic? said Ryan, 50, who lives in Bergen County, N.J. What did they expect us to do? Drop Obamacare during the pandemic?
Tucker Carlson continued his mockery last night of the man he's taken to calling Saint Adam, a nickname intended to convey what he portrays as the congressman's sanctimoniousness. Say what you will, but as a piece of theater, it had literally everything, Carlson said after playing a video clip of Schiff talking on the Senate floor about how Trump's approach to Ukraine has played into Russian President Vladimir Putin's hands.
Edwards has argued that race and gender do matter and that African Americans and women need more representation in the Senate.
Several Democrats, however, are battling for their political lives. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) leads within the margin of error (getting a big boost from the resignation of former governor Eric Greitens, who resigned because of a sexual assault scandal; Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) are in statistical ties in the RealClearPolitics average (although Democrats rightly or wrongly seem unworried about the Heitkamp race).
AHH: Now Trump's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says the White House is hoping to run on the issue of health care ahead of the 2020 election -- a topic that Democrats used to ride to their House majority last year.
Isn't it a good thing that the American public didn't trust Ted on that one?
-- U.S. officials are close to releasing a long-awaited Mideast peace proposal. But Trump's recent actions in the region have increased the likelihood that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will summarily reject the framework. Anne Gearan, Karen DeYoung and Loveday Morris report: The proposal is likely to be released within weeks, with the aim of beginning negotiations between the parties, perhaps as early as this summer … [Jared Kushner] and the chief U.S. negotiator, [Jason D. Greenblatt], are visiting Arab capitals and Israel this week to describe some elements of the administration's vision and seek help in drawing Palestinian leadership to the table. They are not meeting with Abbas or his advisers. Abbas and his Fatah party have refused to meet or talk with White House officials since December, when Trump announced the change to decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem.
Katherine Hempstead, an analyst at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, has documented how national commercial carriers reflected in the stock index have largely abandoned the market to Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and others.
Two more moderates threw their support behind Biden, with enthusiasm and good cheer. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), her voice cracking with emotion, declared, I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his. She then redeployed her own campaign lines to sing Biden's praises. We are never going to out-divide the divider in chief, she warned. She underscored, as she had in her own race, that President Trump lacks empathy, and she extolled the virtues of moderation. If you feel tired of the noise and the nonsense in our politics, and you are tired of the extremes, you have a home with me — and I think you know you have a home with Joe Biden. In what must have been a heart-wrenching day, she put a smile on her face and showed the same feisty demeanor we have seen for more than a year in her own race.
Several major employers, including Dollar General, McDonald's and Olive Garden, have announced incentives for workers to get vaccinated, USA Today reports. But Amazon, Target, Walmart and other major employers are not committing to providing any extra pay or ensuring workers get time off to receive a shot. (Jeff Bezos, the executive chairman of the board of Amazon, owns The Post).
He'll be relieved of his temporary duties in days, assuming William P. Barr is confirmed, ending the improbable tenure of an accidental attorney general. Before joining the Trump administration, Whitaker hawked hot tubs for a company that shut down and reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. His main qualification to be attorney general, it appeared, was criticizing Mueller on TV.
The foundation also reports a 69 percent majority of Americans don't want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. It found 91 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents don't want the ruling overturned, while 57 percent of Republicans would like to see it overturned.
We realize millennials are disaffected and global evangelical leaders are disillusioned, Birdsall said, pointing to his own daughter's concern that people perceive evangelicals as racist and fearful.
Such an examination would probably take months and push a final Supreme Court decision on the issue far into the future, and certainly past this year's elections.
RUBIO: ... Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.
TRUMP: ... I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls. The Cue (ph) poll just came out. I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio. I beat -- I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.
If this package was truly about helping all Americans, why did they change the bipartisan budget formula used in all the other covid packages to reward the blue-state governors, one governor that's being recalled and another governor that hid disclosure of how many deaths that were in nursing homes?
But the fact remains that Ryan and McConnell are now charged with legislating the agenda of a president whose views on some major issues they do not share.
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), a conservative member of the whip team who had endorsed the previous version of the bill, told reporters that the votes were there to pass the new version. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he's pretty confident of the same. But several members from swing seats, including Rep. Mike Coffman ­(R-Colo.) and Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), said outside Pence's office that they remained undecided on how they would vote.
And that goes double in an impeachment process whose outcome isn't in any real doubt. Even if Bolton testified, there is little question the Senate would fail to produce the two-thirds vote needed to remove Trump — something that would require as many as 20 Republicans.
-- Trump met Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro at the White House, and he definitely liked what he saw in the South American nation's far-right leader. Anne Gearan reports: For Trump, the rise of a South American political admirer offers real economic and geopolitical advantages, and a measure of sweet revenge against critics who call both men crass race-baiters. Bolsonaro has embraced his nickname the 'Trump of the Tropics.' 'We do have a great deal of shared values. I admire President Donald Trump,' Bolsonaro said … Trump did not disagree as Bolsonaro said that 'Brazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberty and respect for traditional family lifestyles with respect to God.' He added that they are also united 'against politically correct attitudes and against fake news.'
The conversations are key, because Democrats are likely to use Barr's interactions with the White House to press him to recuse himself from the Mueller probe.
Biden needed not only to deliver a boffo performance but to wound candidates pulling away from him in the polls. Senior Biden campaign officials promised he would draw strong contrasts with Sanders and make electability an issue. He started defensively, acknowledging his hit in Iowa and stating, I'll probably take a hit here. But from there, he took off, defending Obamacare and laying into Sanders for not spelling out the cost of Medicare-for-all. He got the crowd on its feet to applaud Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the impeachment witness whom President Trump fired on Friday. To the applause of the crowd, Biden declared, [Trump] should be pinning a medal on him and not on Rush Limbaugh.
So does the ACA's partial reliance on private insurance to deliver benefits. As Suzanne Mettler argues in her book The Submerged State, social programs that channel public authority through private markets may fail to build strong political constituencies.
And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida. Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.
People who lose their jobs may have difficulty navigating our complex health-care system — and may also discover gaps that remain. People who live in a state that expanded Medicaid, and who are under the income threshold, can get covered now — it does not matter what you made last month. What matters for Medicaid is current income. But those 2 to 4 million who might otherwise get Medicaid but live in a state that did not expand may be out of luck.
Association health plans — including those in the agriculture space — have a mixed record. Some, such as Western Growers Insurance Services in California, are thriving and even expanding. Others haven't managed to survive, like Citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers, which was forced to close its self-insured plan in 2002.
Democrats had put themselves back on defense and had somehow turned an issue that should have been an unalloyed advantage into a political liability.
The Congressional Budget Office is expected to release an analysis by the end of March or the beginning of April on design and policy considerations in developing single payer proposals, Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) told me. At that point, the committee will hold a hearing with the CBO to go over the potential costs of the measures offered by Jayapal and others and their impact on the federal budget.
The 14-to-14 vote along party lines means that it will be up to Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to advance Becerra's nomination to the full Senate, The Post's Dan Diamond reports.
But the fact that Warnock has pastoral responsibilities puts him in an unusual strategic position — not just with voters who want to walk a righteous path, but also with respect to the radical liberal attack line from Republicans. In December, the New York Times reported that a different group of religious leaders wrote an open letter to Loeffler, asking her to stop calling Warnock a radical, saying that doing so amounted to a broader attack against the Black Church and faith traditions for which we stand. The pastor's social justice theological and faith traditions, they reportedly wrote, are not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, but also a central message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
That was the same decision made by former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Flake was never an ally of Trump's, instead serving as one of the few voices of criticism within the Republican Senate caucus. With his reelection looming and his position among Arizona Republicans slipping — with Trump's encouragement — Flake decided against seeking another term. It ended up being a good example of how Trump's grievances can be shortsighted, though: Flake was ultimately replaced by a Democratic senator, Kyrsten Sinema.
Seizures and convulsions are known potential side effects of nicotine poisoning, and the FDA says vaping products may make it possible for people to inhale nicotine quickly, or for users to inhale more nicotine than usual, which could be leading to the seizures.
Speaking on Meet the Press, Mulvaney said that conservatives were not the only ones to blame, saying, It was a bizarre combination of who was against this bill, some folks in the Freedom Caucus and then moderates on the other end of our spectrum.
­-- Shattering glass: For the first time, the flagship law journals at the top 16 law schools in the country are all led by women. Ann Marimow reports: Only one woman worked on the staff of the Harvard Law Review when Ruth Bader Ginsburg arrived on campus in 1956. It would be another two decades before a woman was elected to lead the school's prestigious legal journal. The Supreme Court justice recently addressed the current slate of editors in chief from the top 16 law schools in the country. For the first time ever, all are women. … The event in part celebrated the statistical improbability of an all-female sweep of elections at the leading publications of legal scholarship at schools including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, Columbia and Duke universities. The editors in chief collaborated for the first time to publish a Women & Law journal with a series of essays from prominent female lawyers. But there was also recognition, as the women came together dressed in dark power suits, of the reality that men still dominate the ranks of law firms, the federal judiciary and academia. ...
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that the case in Guangzhou was medically similar to the ones seen in Cuba last year, when a large part of the American Embassy staff was withdrawn after many complained of symptoms that included hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, visual difficulties, headaches and fatigue, our colleagues report.
AHH: Melania Trump has said she'll announce her initiatives as first lady today in the Rose Garden. The focus will be on the overall well-being of children, encompassing a range of issues children face growing up instead of a single topic, the AP reports.
Molly Roberts, editorial writer: Great. You've mentioned the Amazons and Netflixes of the world a lot. I keep thinking if I got a thousand dollars a month, why wouldn't I just go and spend it on Amazon? Is there anything besides taxing these big companies more that we need to do? Do we need to, as a lot of other candidates have said, break up Big Tech?
Quality control = rigged? he wrote on Twitter, adding the thinking-face emoji. Donald Trump Jr. declared, The fix is in … AGAIN.
correction An earlier version of this column imprecisely described the alleged actions of two associates of President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. This version has been updated.
The third obstacle is the politics: specifically, the idea of taking benefits away from millions of Americans, whether deliberately or because the GOP fails to install an adequate replacement. Obamacare would have been much easier to repeal had it never been implemented in the first place. But today, 20 million Americans have signed up and many other Americans have come to enjoy parts of Obamacare such as the requirement for insurers to cover preexisting conditions and the option of keeping children on their parents' health-care plan until they turn 26.
When we were writing his plan, we didn't read any polls, the campaign's policy director, Sonal Shah, told me yesterday. We were focused on how do we get to quality coverage. 
In short, last week's action on the Senate floor and in the White House may be the inevitable posturing before a negotiation process that has not been foreclosed, and which could yet produce a package between $618 billion and $1.9 trillion (closer to the latter, we would hope) capable of getting 60 votes in the Senate. Certainly the benefits for Mr. Biden of not giving up on such a result outweigh the risks. Moderates in both parties have some good ideas: Limiting the direct payments was one; making future stimulus contingent on objective indicators, such as the unemployment rate, could be another. Giving them a genuine hearing — and exhausting the possibilities for compromise, even if it fails — would enhance the legitimacy of a party-line bill when and if that becomes unavoidable. This is the approach that got Mr. Biden elected, because voters, correctly, bet that it would be the healthiest one for the country.
— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) announced he's working on a paid family leave bill with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), the first such bipartisan effort.
But Azar does have the power to start shifting certain drugs to Part D, using experimental models allowed under current law – and he said he's moving swiftly in that direction. The move will require a stiff spine, Andy Slavitt, who led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama, told me.
Molina Healthcare announced this month that it would leave marketplaces in Utah and Wisconsin and scale back in Washington. It left the door open to more exits.
Instead, the Justice Department's decision gave Democratic leaders a chance to capitalize on a message they homed in on during the midterm elections. It also pushed the health care battle into the middle of the 2020 campaign, as our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Seung Min Kim report, with several presidential candidates tweeting to blast the president on health care.
The council, which has advised the White House on HIV/AIDS policies since its founding in 1995, offers recommendations on the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, a five-year plan responding to the epidemic. The council's executive director, Kaye Hayes, confirmed in a statement that all remaining 10 council members had received the termination letters last Wednesday.

Legislator and governors should be careful if they are considering overturning the will of the voters, Slavitt told me. Some believe that in a conservative state, they will not face consequences from voters if they overturn their will. I don't think that's a good bet.
I think it's great when new members come in and have ideas and give speeches, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.). But I'm struck at how often I'm being asked by the press about a gauzy resolution that has no details to it.
Barr did not take the bait, answering each question with a version of: I'd have to know the specifics.
Josh Peck, co-founder of Get America Covered, questioned what other kinds of circumstances would justify letting taxpayers off the hook for not buying health insurance. He said that while he was working at CMS under Barack Obama, the agency had thoroughly explored the extent to which exemptions were needed.
Molina Healthcare chief executive Mario Molina said recently that the cost-sharing funds are a major uncertainty hanging over his company's ability to participate in the marketplaces going forward. Another is enforcement of the individual mandate that compels Americans to provide proof of insurance on their taxes.
— Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has apologized to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for saying it was ridiculous for McCain to request that President Trump not attend his funeral, a remark that drew a swift rebuke from McCain's daughter Meghan McCain. I agree with the daughter, a remorseful Hatch told The Post's Sean Sullivan and Paul Kane yesterday. I shouldn't have said anything yesterday. I agree a hundred percent with her.
The lawsuit also would wipe out consumer protections established by the law, such as allowing children to remain on their parents' health-care plans up to age 26 and requiring insurers to accept those with preexisting medical conditions without charging them more.
He came under frequent fire from Democrats for not doing more to rein in Nunes, whom many saw as the chief destabilizing force behind the scenes of the panel's Russia investigation.
But Republicans may have made a strategic error by agreeing to the specifics of a five-year CHIP funding bill before the spending mechanisms were decided. Now they have little negotiating power, even as Democrats continue blocking their proposal.
But most policy analysts — even conservative ones — say allowing insurers to sell their plans across state lines wouldn't help bring down prices much and could even hurt plans. The chief reason for that is the geographic nature of health care itself.
On Dec 26, most immigration judges were also furloughed, according to president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, Ashley Tabaddor.
And the truth is that Trump's broadside against the terrible dishonesty of the media will leave lots of heads nodding around the country. This tweet, from conservative commentator Matt Lewis nails that:
Axios reported in November that Trump became furious after reading an article in the Wall Street Journal that said Puerto Rico bond prices soared . . . after the federal oversight board that runs the U.S. territory's finances released a revised fiscal plan that raises expectations for disaster funding and economic growth. Aides suggested that the president misinterpreted the article and concluded that island officials were using disaster funds to pay down debt. But neither Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló nor a federal board that oversees the territory's finances has argued that federal disaster relief funds should be used to directly pay off debts. Rosselló and other local leaders have actively advocated against such a move.
Practically speaking, the measure is unnecessary. Democratic attorneys general around the country, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, are already vigorously defending the ACA against the Republican attacks. And some legal experts have contended the House lacks standing to intervene in the lawsuit at all.
Biden pledged yesterday to try to help the rest of the world with vaccines, after making sure Americans are taken care of first.

It's possible we're seeing the beginnings of Cruz trying to reshape his reputation as the guy who has made enemies in Congress to the guy who has stood up to Congress when necessary but can get along fine with them otherwise.

But Trump misleadingly compared those numbers with the known cases of covid-19 in the United States. Tens of millions of people each year come down with the flu — possibly as many as 58 million in 2017-2018. The fatality rate of the seasonal flu in the United States is 0.1 percent. The new coronavirus appears to have a much higher fatality rate.

I want every family to have that same freedom, Buttigieg said.
Still, many Republicans are troubled by the first month of Trump's presidency. It's not just his brashness or tendency to pick fights, they have said, but also the substance of some of the policies he has tried to implement. Chief among them: his immigration ban.
Andrew Yang, a former business executive, came to The Post on Thursday to talk about why he is running for president and what he hopes to accomplish if elected. Here is the full transcript and audio recording of our conversation. — Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor

Sinema's vote wasn't nearly so pivotal in this case, but she is emerging as a likely pivotal vote on key Democratic initiatives — and one who could find herself pitted against the liberal Democratic base on other issues. She's already taken heat for bucking an effort to get rid of the filibuster.

President-elect Biden has said he wants to restore the soul of America and unite us here at home. To do that, we must address the needs of our whole society from the inside out, with a focused framework to advance our common causes and meet the challenges we are confronting together.
This barrage of executive orders, including the most substantive one (the ban), is largely about portraying Trump as a man of action, as Kellyanne Conway put it.

Insurance providers in Tennessee have pulled out of the Obamacare exchange, leaving residents in 16 counties without health insurance. That's affecting more than 1.1 million people, Kustoff's office said, adding that premiums in Tennessee have skyrocketed to as much as 116 percent.
New York City eventually settled three federal lawsuits filed by Muslim plaintiffs and other groups after the AP's reporting. The city did not admit to misconduct or constitutional violations as part of those settlements. However, it agreed to a prohibition on investigations on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or national origin and to a civilian appointee to monitor compliance. The third settlement required New York City to pay more than $1 million in damages and legal fees to Muslim groups, businesses and individuals.
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now, Trump declared in his 16-minute address.

Over the past two years, the Chamber has tried to regain influence over the Republican caucus by opposing a few of the more radical tea party candidates in Republican primaries. Under Timmons, once a top Republican aide on Capitol Hill, NAM has helped moderate Democrats retain their seats. Still, the bitter partisanship is now so hard-wired into Washington's political culture that it will be years before big business can again cobble together the bipartisan centrist coalitions on which it traditionally relied.
States also have certain requirements and conditions about who can collect unemployment benefits. Texas and Florida, for example, require recipients to be actively searching for work while they collect payments. Pennsylvania requires beneficiaries to register for employment-search services and mandates they not refuse work when offered without good cause.

Fred Hiatt: You can define a timeline maybe to destroy the caliphate, but ISIS hasn't gone away. There are Islamist terrorist groups in northern Africa and Afghanistan, and a lot of people in the military would say without some presence on the ground, gathering intelligence and responding, they can't contain those threats on a continuing basis. Is that wrong?
A few more interesting reads about the Trump administration:
In short, Democratic voters definitely should be concerned about giving Trump the political upper hand. The worst thing they can do, far worse than nominating a political neophyte, is to nominate someone with an agenda easily portrayed as scary. If the candidate has no track record of success for measures precisely because they are far out on the left-wing of an already progressive party, primary voters should run the other way. If Democrats want to win, they better find a candidate who can remind voters Trump is the scary one with policies (e.g., repealing Obamacare, tax cuts for the rich) ordinary voters hate.
While many Republicans are frustrated by what is going on in Washington, polls have shown that Trump remains popular with most members of the party and continues to be viewed positively by his base.
-- A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday found that Democrats have opened a 14-point advantage over Republicans when registered voters are asked which party would better handle immigration, up from just six points last fall.

Fifty two percent of Americans support this, even with very aggressive wording — the question raises the prospect of heavy taxes on the rich, in order to redistribute wealth. A solid majority of moderates agrees. But large percentages of Republicans and conservatives oppose it. (In fairness, some polling has shown that Republicans, too, favor tax hikes on the rich.)

She said this after watching Price speak at a rally for Republican candidate Karen Handel. The HHS secretary began his speech in an airplane hangar here on Saturday by noting that he had come in his personal capacity. He made just one passing reference to the health debate in his remarks. Even then, it was part of a laundry list. Between calls for lower taxes and stronger national security, he said: And you all want patient-centered health care. That was it.
The law sought to stop drugmakers from hiking generic drug prices in a way the state determined was unconscionable. Health-care advocates and Maryland's Democratic attorney general, Brian Frosh, championed the 2017 law as a groundbreaking attempt to rein in skyrocketing prescription costs, the Baltimore Sun's Jeff Barker reports. In April, a federal appeals court ruled the law violated the commerce clause of the Constitution, prompting an appeal from Frosh.
Caseloads in the TANF program have declined over the past 15 years, from about 2.4 million families to 1.6 million families. After its post-Great Recession peak in 2013, the number of people receiving food stamps has declined.

They hope to distribute the 76,000 kits by the end of the fiscal year in September, our Post colleague Peter Jamison reports. Doing so would be a significant expansion of efforts to provide naloxone in overdose-heavy neighborhoods throughout a city that has had one of the highest rates of drug deaths in the nation. By comparison, just 2,396 naloxone kits were passed out in the city during the last nine months of 2017, when overdose deaths hit a peak in D.C.
For them to say they're bored, it has a lot to do with them not wanting to hear evidence, countered Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). They don't want to hear that this president who they're so busy supporting did these things. As I put it, the truth hurts.
Ditto for former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who delayed a final committee vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh to give the FBI another week to investigate decades-old allegations of sexual assault. A poll of Arizona voters at the time showed 59 percent of Arizona Democrats had a favorable view of him, as compared with just 20 percent of Republicans. Flake took the same exit ramp as Corker, acknowledging he couldn't win a GOP primary.
Either path will be aggressively opposed by the PhRMA industry and their surrogates and either path will require a stiff spine from the secretary, Slavitt wrote me in an email.
But tribalism is a two-way street: One big reason the border wall has become less popular since Trump made it the centerpiece of his campaign is that Democrats changed their minds about it.
Simply put, we're concerned that some patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors touting treatments of plasma from young donors as cures and remedies, they wrote.
Democrats are particularly incensed at Collins, who delivered a 44-minute-long floor speech in October declaring her support for Kavanaugh, they write. At the time, Collins, who supports abortion rights, said she did not think Kavanaugh would vote to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
Margaret A. Murray, the chief executive of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, which represents plans for low-income and vulnerable populations, said that anyone who has bought individual insurance and has had so much as a case of asthma in their past should be deeply unsettled by the choices this administration has made.
The Democratic leadership and rank-and-file members are planning to prevent the chamber from conducting routine business, including allowing committees to meet for extended hearings when the Senate is in session, Manu Raju and Ted Barrett report.

Northam, a pediatrician and former Army doctor who treated wounded soldiers in Operation Desert Storm, contends the state has not just a moral duty to care for the poor but an economic incentive to do so. Expansion would create a healthier workforce, encourage the poor to seek primary care rather than expensive emergency-room treatment and create 30,000 health-care jobs, he has said.

Democrats fret this could cost them Florida in the general. Terrie Rizzo, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, didn't mention Sanders by name but released a statement saying Democrats in her state stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have fled violent dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Two Democratic congresswomen from Florida – Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala – took issue with the comments as well, with Shalala saying she hopes that Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro. Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the only Cuban American Democratic senator, also denounced Sanders's comments.

If it gets down to two-person race — it's likely there will be a majority. But if it looks like there is a third or fourth candidate who is strong and amassing delegates, then things get interesting. Let's suppose all four candidates come out on Wednesday with delegates in the hundreds. Then you have a very interesting race …
Expansion is a top priority for Gov. Ralph Northam (D), as it was for his Democratic predecessor, Terry McAuliffe. They contend it would provide health care to as many as 400,000 uninsured Virginians and create 30,000 jobs.

So far, there is no suggestion that he will. Over weeks of negotiation, McConnell has refused to bow to pressure from Senate and House Democrats — or even from more moderate members of his own caucus — over how he will manage the process.

-- A major donor to Trump's inaugural committee intends to plead guilty to obstruction of justice after federal prosecutors filed a new charge alleging that the investor backdated a check and deleted emails to hinder an investigation into where he got money he ultimately gave to the committee. Matt Zapotosky reports: Imaad Zuberi — a venture capitalist who gave significant money to Democrats and Republicans over the years — was accused by federal prosecutors in New York of trying to hide from investigators that a $900,000 donation he made to Trump's inaugural committee was actually funded by others, court records show. Zuberi already had pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Los Angeles to an array of charges stemming from a lobbying scheme in which he arranged illegal campaign contributions, hid his work from the government and cheated on his taxes. David Kelley, Zuberi's attorney, said he had reached an agreement with federal prosecutors in New York to transfer the new matter to Los Angeles, where Zuberi intends to plead guilty. Provided the arrangement is approved by the court, he would presumably be sentenced on the West Coast in connection with both matters.
Meanwhile, higher-income, younger Americans — many of whom live in urban areas won by Hillary Clinton — stand to get more assistance in the Republican legislation.

Republicans have warned over the years that Washington could not afford to make good on its promise to pick up most of the $2 billion annual cost. Some fiscal hawks in the House say that concern has hardly gone away given the soaring federal deficits projected to result from Trump's budget plan. Other Republicans have expressed philosophical objections to providing an entitlement to able-bodied Virginians, no matter how poor.

I am alarmed that he might not stand up to the pharmaceutical industry. And I am alarmed that he might not stand up to President Trump's agenda driven by sabotage and ideology.
Even if a patient living in a high-cost area such as Manhattan could buy a presumably cheaper plan sold in a lower-cost area such as Iowa, they would still have to receive their care from a facility physically nearby.

WHY IT'S BIG: The justices regularly are called to invalidate state electoral maps that have been illegally drawn to reduce the influence of racial minorities … But the Supreme Court has never found a plan unconstitutional because of partisan gerrymandering.

The bill includes an amendment that would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. Another amendment that would provide $8 billion over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions swayed some concerned moderate Republicans to support the bill, allowing the House GOP leadership to secure enough votes to pass it.
Two new magazine covers confronted the family separations:
Clyburn (D-S.C.), whose district encompasses eight of the state's poorest counties, has long opposed cash payments to African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved. He believes it would be too difficult to determine who deserves to be compensated. But a race-neutral anti-poverty program he conceived a decade ago is now catching fire among candidates for the Democratic nomination as a way to provide practical restitution for slavery, Tracy Jan reports. Several presidential hopefuls, including [Sanders and Klobuchar], have sought to rebrand Clyburn's program as a vehicle for reparations, which remain politically contentious. Clyburn's idea, with strong bipartisan support, was originally adopted in 2009 by just one federal agency. But framing the program, which targets federal spending on certain high-poverty areas, as reparations has drawn criticism from African Americans living in poor urban neighborhoods — some in Clyburn's own district — that do not qualify for the funding, as well as longtime advocates for reparations. The critique underlines the difficulty of finding a solution that would satisfy those demanding redress and also be politically viable.
Whoever is to replace Sanders as the standard-bearer for the left — hopefully someone as smart and wonky as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — will need to learn how to win elections. (Hint: It is not by scaring voters or attaching oneself to the socialist label.)

Unlike Sanders, Warren (or whoever else takes the reins) will not be burdened by a record of reflexively praising dictators nor be driven to attack fellow Democrats.

* COUNTRIES IN TRUMP'S BAN AREN'T MAJOR TERROR SOURCES: The Wall Street Journal delivers a dose of reality:
While Trump has issued a flurry of executive orders and delivered on one key conservative agenda item — the confirmation of a successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — there is mounting fear that other marquee campaign promises will not be realized, making it harder for Republicans to win elections.

In a tense exchange on 'CBS Sunday Morning,' Koppel told the Fox News host and staunch [Trump supporter] that his brand of opinion-based journalism was harming the country. Derek Hawkins reports.
The President was unpopular, the Democrats were motivated and GOP members were retiring rather than opting to run for re-election in what was shaping up to be an awful, no good, terrible year. Today, however, there are plenty of signs that 2018 isn't like 2006. For, one, Trump's job approval rating in the Gallup survey is 45 percent, eight points higher than the dismal 37 percent where George W. Bush was sitting at this point in 2006. Gallup also found that satisfaction with the direction of the country at a 12-year high. A marked improvement from 2006. 'After a January 2006 reading of 36%,' writes Gallup's Jim Norman, 'satisfaction failed to surpass 35% the rest of that year, and with the economic calamities that followed over the next few years, it descended into single digits in two 2008 polls and has subsequently stayed mostly below 30%.'
I don't know if I have any data on how pro-lifers feel about Trump in general, Dannenfelser said. But 'Never Trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. Trump is a pro-life hero, she said.
Republicans, who are in the House minority, remain opposed to the committee's proposal, as they were when the House passed elements of it in individual bills last year. In his opening statement as the committee began debating its relief bill, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), Ways and Means' ranking Republican, criticized what he called higher subsidies for the failing Obamacare program. And he derided the larger subsidies for COBRA insurance, contending they would be another incentive to stay home, rather than rejoin the workforce.

If they can prevent shutdowns most of the time then, why not all the time? Members all say they hate them. The answer, according to the bulk of the evidence, is that there's largely no pain at the polls for most members who help instigate shutdowns, even when people blame them or their party for the disruption.

Michael S.

In Sept. 2017, Democrats suggested $25 billion for the wall. In exchange, they would get a path to citizenship for dreamers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. Trump signaled he would sign on, until his far-right base of supporters told him to hold out.
But Tuesday, Reid began his daily remarks to the Senate by declaring that I want everyone to know that my criticism of the senior senator from Texas is not based on anything dealing with his character, his integrity.
The day of pageantry and ritual — orchestrated both to celebrate the installation of a new commander in chief and to symbolize a peaceful transfer of power — began with a church service and included a military review, a triumphant ­parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and evening balls.
Nevertheless, a big Trump victory will not change much in the race. For one thing, virtually everyone is expecting his enormous margin of victory in his home state. A large batch of delegates for Trump here was already baked into the candidates' delegate estimates; it is not as if a Trump win fundamentally changes Cruz's delegate strategy. As a Cruz adviser put it, nobody is really going to be shocked if Trump runs up the numbers, especially given the media obsession with the New York values theme. Nevertheless, if the Cruz camp is going to get back on track, picking up delegates a week from today and setting itself up for wins in Indiana, the Great Plains and the West, there are lessons to be learned from this week.
While we can applaud those who have launched this much needed public conversation about economic justice, however, that doesn't excuse their bullying efforts to banish thoughtful criticism or competing ideas.
Critics of President Trump's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, have frequently said that doing so conflicts with his work to stem the nation's opioid crisis, which has taken more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades.
Seeking to highlight his record on immigration, Trump traveled to the border Friday for the third time this year and declared that the country is full. The area he toured includes a barrier with a plaque labeling it as President Trump's Border Wall, though in fact it is long-planned replacement fencing.
As someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . Those of us who said, 'He's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said Charles Camosy, an ethics and theology professor at Fordham University who writes books and articles about abortion. But when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. And what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'Grab 'em by the p—y' guy?
-- There are two Joe Bidens. The wrong one is running for president, Karen Tumulty observes in a smart column: Biden sounds like a man whose time has passed. Many in the modest-sized crowds that he draws are dismayed. After he spoke on the same stage as the other Democratic candidates at a state Democratic Party dinner on Saturday night, one undecided voter told me: 'Joe needs to retire.' This has become a common refrain, even among people who admire and respect Biden. But then there is the Biden you see mostly on the rope line.
Mitch McConnell, after months of legislative inactivity, will now force votes on abortion.
The article said it provided a snapshot, not a definitive portrait, and that at least eight plans almost certainly lost money.

When his first son was born two years ago, he and his wife paid cash for the prenatal expenses and birth — a total of about $12,000, he said. It struck him as a reasonable cost.
Figures released Wednesday by federal health officials show the number of consumers who chose coverage through HealthCare.gov from Feb. 15 to Feb. 28 — 206,236 — was nearly three times higher than during the same period last year and roughly 3½ times greater than in 2019, The Post's Amy Goldstein reports.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: I have many, many millions of followers on Twitter and it's different than it used to be, President Trump said. Things are happening, names are taken off, people aren't getting through. ... It seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, there's discrimination and big discrimination. ( CNN )

They are also about twice as likely to be Black compared with the national average.
Klein opens his book by dismissing individuals and leadership as explanations for polarization, in favor of structural or institutional factors. That may be a proper analytical stance, but often structural change can come about only as a result of external crises combined with the proper visionary leadership. Democrats will not win back swing voters by writing off their opponents as simple racists and xenophobes; they need to show empathy for the legitimate concerns of a working class that is in serious trouble. Identity is an inherently flexible concept that can be deliberately shaped in broader or narrower ways. Liberals around the world have lost ground to populists by ignoring the broad moral appeal of national identity, which in a diverse contemporary society needs to be built around liberal and democratic values. Klein dismisses complaints about political correctness and identity politics on the left, but a politics built on the grievances of ever narrower identity groups breeds similar thinking on the right, and it cannot be the basis for a broader democratic, civic identity that is the ultimate answer to polarization.
The deductibles and Obamacare are so high, on average $7,000. You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits, and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right?
This is another big question mark. An excise tax on health-insurance plans and a tax on medical devices went into effect Jan. 1, but the industry has been heavily lobbying for months to delay them again. Although industry is expressing optimism it will ultimately succeed, it's unclear whether delays will get rolled into a spending bill.
Senate GOP leaders are trying to convey to members that they face a binary choice, according to one person familiar with leadership strategy, between getting a deal done among themselves or having to work with Democrats, which is a less palatable option.
Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS. Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for? Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe? And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?
In a recruiting coup for national Democrats, the former presidential candidate is telling people that he is now inclined to run against Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), the New York Times reports. Bullock has only a few days to finalize his decision: The filing deadline to run in Montana is Monday.
Pelosi spokesperson Henry Connelly dismissed the idea that Primus wanted negative analysis of Medicare-for-all. Wendell absolutely did not ask for any kind of one-sided analysis of Medicare-for-all, and anyone who says otherwise wasn't actually listening, he said. As Democrats, across the entire spectrum, we believe in legislating based on facts, data and honest analysis.
Two years ago today, President Trump launched the campaign that would end up being one of the biggest upsets in modern U.S. presidential history.
TRUMP: Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.
6. Renewing FISA: Should the government be able to spy on a foreigner without a warrant? And, in the process, collect any communication that foreigner has with Americans? A program that lets the government do that, known as FISA, expires on Jan. 19. A House aide predicted to The Washington Post's Jeff Stein the issue will get a vote in the next few weeks, which means Congress could have a potentially contentious debate on its hands.
Electability as a buzzword has become quite blasé in the aftermath of Iowa. I interviewed more than a dozen voters at both the Klobuchar and Warren rallies. The most striking takeaway from these conversations was that several women across the ideological spectrum complained without prompting – and without me using it – about the pervasiveness of the term in the Democratic debate.
Sanders's Cold War travels face fresh scrutiny.
-- Many lesser-known Democratic candidates are trying different ways to get 65,000 individual donors, the magic number needed to secure a spot on stage for the debates. Michael Scherer reports: The latest turn … looks a bit like an infomercial for a food dehydrator or Ginsu knives. Former congressman John Delaney stands in front of a whiteboard in an online video, pitching voters on a new way to double their money. 'It's really simple, and it's actually a pretty good deal,' the Maryland Democrat says. 'You give one, I give two to a charity of your choice.' You heard that right, folks. A candidate for president wants your donation so badly that he is willing to pay twice as much out of pocket. Buttigieg reached his 65,000 goal last week after a successful CNN town hall. ... Businessman Andrew Yang put a counter on his homepage to drive the online energy past 65,000 donors. … Aides to Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru, and former housing secretary Julián Castro say their campaigns are also on track to qualify. Using polling alone to filter the field, especially this early in the process, would almost certainly have meant a far smaller group of candidates onstage. Recent national polls have shown no more than a dozen candidates with 1 percent support, the criteria used to qualify for the first Democratic debate in 2015.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is co-sponsoring the reinsurance bill, told Axios she's working with the House on potential changes to that measure, to which Republicans have indicated they're more open than cost-sharing payments. Reinsurance was part of the House's repeal and replace efforts, so there's no reason why Republicans would be philosophically against it right off the bat. Depends on the details of the package, a House GOP aide told Caitlin Owens.
This week: Combine two or more names from the list below of the new members of Congress to co-sponsora bill based on their combined last names, and state its purpose, as in the examples above. We're just playing with the sound of their names, not referring to the sens and reps themselves. Note the pronouncers next to some of the names; the Empress will accept a small stretch of pronunciation, but you can't pretend that, say, Rep. Peter Meijer pronounces his name Major. (It's pronounced myer, as shoppers at his family's huge Midwestern supermarket chain know.)

Powell could hardly have predicted just how much success his vision would have over the next half-century, in almost every area of the law. The Supreme Court would repeatedly rule in favor of corporations and the rich, and against the middle class and the poor — undermining unions, paving the way for lower taxes and generally playing an underappreciated role in reshaping the economy in ways that hurt working people. Democratic presidential candidates and the media generally attribute growing inequality to policies adopted by Congress and presidents, and to larger forces like automation, but the Supreme Court deserves a sizable share of the blame.
-- Politico, Conservative breakup: Club for Growth splits with Jamestown Associates, by Alex Isenstadt: The anti-tax group Club for Growth has split with the prominent Republican advertising firm Jamestown Associates, a rare breakup in the tight-knit world of conservative politics that could have ripple effects for GOP candidates across the country. On March 20, Club for Growth President David McIntosh sent a memo to his staff effectively severing its relationship with Jamestown Associates, which it had previously endorsed at a time when mainstream Republican Party groups were blacklisting the firm.
They had that conversation even before Northam was sworn in, when they met to talk about rural issues. They had it again just three days after inauguration, after Senate Democrats made good on a threat to kill Stanley's hospital bill if he did not back expansion.
That effort used the budget process to eliminate the penalties for individuals who do not buy health insurance and repealed the authority of the federal government to run health-care exchanges, rendering the parts of the ACA intended to expand private insurance coverage essentially useless.
More context from Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation
Biden seemed prepared for the attack and struck back at Harris, saying that early in his career he became a public defender. I didn't become a prosecutor, Biden said, a knock on Harris, whose past as the top prosecutor in California has stirred suspicion from some black voters.
And I said that my wife and I were sort-of looking forward to a bit of respite, and I didn't want to stick my head into that meat grinder, Barr said.
The sensory bombardment, Wolf says, reduces our ability to be critically analytical, which intensifies confusion — which may make viewers more susceptible to false or inaccurate information. She thinks it would be wise to eliminate the ticker — MSNBC already has — and clear out some of the clutter.
Although polls across the state closed at 8 p.m., results were held until 9 p.m., because four polling places in Baltimore were ordered by a judge to stay open an extra hour after delays opening Tuesday morning. Edwards had filed an emergency complaint late Tuesday afternoon, seeking the extension.
Against all expectation, Trump defeated the wizard Hillary Clinton. He and his followers discovered amazing new abilities as they pressed on.
Everybody that even gives any hint of being a birther — a word you didn't use — even a little bit of a hint, like, gee, you know, maybe, just maybe, this much of a chance: They label them as an idiot, Donald Trump tells the network's Ashleigh Banfield when she asks whether he thinks Obama was born in the United States. After insisting that he was not an idiot, Trump explains his purported rationale:
-- A new study found methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry are far higher than EPA estimates indicate. The New York Times's John Schwartz and Brad Plumer: The new study, published Thursday in the journal Science, puts the rate of methane emissions from domestic oil and gas operations at 2.3 percent of total production per year, which is 60 percent higher than the current estimate from the [EPA]. That might seem like a small fraction of the total, but it represents an estimated 13 million metric tons lost each year, or enough natural gas to fuel 10 million homes. (One of Pruitt's first actions as EPA administrator was to withdraw a request to the oil and gas industry to provide more information on methane emissions.)
He also stressed he believes the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections to aid Trump. But Barr added that he wants to ensure the fixation on Russia does not obscure the danger from China.
The Democrats still testing the waters don't have the same ties to the party's left and can be judicious about which policies they endorse. In the past week, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) has hinted that he might run, suggesting that the party could use another center-left voice; Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) delivered a foreign policy speech and confirmed that he might run; Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) warned that he was not hearing from the rest of the field the sort of message that could win. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who's seen as a figure from his party's left, has not signed onto Medicare-for-all legislation; it did not stop him from speaking to receptive crowds in New Hampshire.

Planned Parenthood was long one of the conservative movement's top targets even before Republicans took back the White House. For much of Richards's tenure, Planned Parenthood was engaged in battles to protect its taxpayer funding, both federally and in states, Dave reports. In 2011, she led a high-profile campaign to block funding cuts, pointing out that Planned Parenthood enjoyed far more public support than Congress.
Azar is leading an administration task force overseeing the coronavirus response that is composed of top officials from the White House and other agencies. And federal health officials have worked closely with states, even shipping coronavirus test kits to more than 100 state labs on Wednesday, the Post's Lena H. Sun reports.
But the response to those and subsequent attacks has been underwhelming, some legislators and other observers say.
The whole reason Trump and the [Republicans] oppose the court taking the case now is to postpone the public focus on the disastrous impacts of the lawsuit until after the election, Dach wrote.
From Ryan's perspective, his strategy worked. He managed to get a tax bill signed into law while passing an Obamacare repeal bill through the House, all while allowing himself room to say the president was wrong to equate white supremacists with counterprotesters last summer in Charlottesville
Sean Spicer was asked during his briefing on Friday whether Trump still believes the BLS numbers are a hoax. I talked to the President prior to this, he replied, and he said to quote him very clearly: 'They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.' The press room laughed.
Alvarado, Barrett and Lunadetta, all of whom voted for her 15 months ago said that they would do so again.
Trump previewed a Fourth of July celebration at the Lincoln Memorial:
For a democracy, you need negotiation skills that he doesn't have, she said. It's more of a dictator.
For the past 15 years Warnock has been the senior pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the same church once led by his hero, Martin Luther King Jr. The flamboyant, preacher-pol style that Warnock cultivated at Ebenezer may be alien to many Americans, including many White Christians. But it is deeply familiar to those who grew up in and around Southern Black churches. In those churches, preachers make it their business to tell uncomfortable truths about American life, including the shameful ways the country treats its African American citizens.
Another wild card is Trump's pick for health and human services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). Trump suggested Wednesday that Price would play a key role in shaping the Obamacare replacement strategy.
We would answer skeptics with an emphatic yes. There are many reasons to hope Mr. Biden's message, delivered with evident passion and no little eloquence, could have real effect. One reason is that, unlike Mr. Trump, he did not contaminate it with rancor about carnage and stolen jobs, or pit a righteous public against an exploitative establishment. He instead urged humility and asked those who did not support us to hear me out. Additionally, Mr. Biden approached the inaugural lectern knowing how dangerously Mr. Trump deepened divisions, especially on Jan. 6. His description of democracy as fragile was rooted in this experience, which many in his audience lived first-hand. The presence of leading Republicans — former vice president Mike Pence, Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.) — in that audience was a promising sign, more resonant, surely, than the mean-spirited message Mr. Trump sent by not showing up.
But there are a slew of other actions that deeply frustrate them, most prominently the failure of Congress to reimburse insurers for the extra cost-sharing discounts or fund a reinsurance pool that helps protect insurers against heavy losses.
In both tone and substance, this president spent his first day harking back to the serious, responsible traditions of the office. It felt bracingly, refreshingly new.

Longtime AIDS activist Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute and one of the two new co-chairs of the White House's HIV/AIDS advisory council, called the administration's plans a bold initiative. But, he added, there is a lot of distrust in the HIV community, and rightly so. In the next couple of days and weeks, the administration will have to prove themselves that they are serious about this. . . . The additional resources will be needed.
-- A new Iowa caucus app is sparking election security concerns. From NBC News: The app will be used in Iowa and Nevada by caucus managers — local registered Democrats who sign up to organize and run the caucus process in each location — to expedite the process, calculate and assign delegates and report results back quickly. The app will also be used in satellite voting locations across the country and overseas. But questions about the app remain unanswered, including who developed it and whether it has been subjected to independent security testing. Security experts say that the app is a potential target for early election interference, particularly since it is downloaded on to the personal phones of the caucus managers. Party officials say operational security prevents them from disclosing specifics about the app.
SPICER: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us again. We are now 10 days away from inauguration day. Getting realer and realer every day, so we're into the single digits tomorrow.
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ONE BAD HOMBRE:
Yes, Biden replied. I think he'll probably end up being prosecuted, too.
As for Sanders's supporters (who we now know from three weeks of humiliating losses are not as numerous as one might have imagined), some of them will go off in a huff no matter what, just as they did in 2016. (Some high-profile supporters, for example, voted for Jill Stein). Others have already decided that, yes, President Trump really is an existential threat, so they will of course support Biden, just as NeverTrumpers and supporters of other losing candidates have done. (Would anyone who would have otherwise refused to vote for Biden be won over if Biden said, Sure, I love Bernie's Green New Deal?)
Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. (Iran's nuclear program has continued, after Trump canceled the deal, although there are no indications that it has a nuclear weapon.)
Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, presented options to overhaul the Medicaid system, but said no final decisions were made.
Almost immediately, Democrats launched a divisive debate over how to improve the current system. Some on the far left demanded that Democrats commit to abolishing private health insurance, which would involve taking employer-based plans away from some 180 million Americans who might be averse to giving them up. The amount of blowback after Obamacare canceled objectively bad insurance plans for just a few million Americans suggests how toxic a single-payer-or-bust purity test could be.
— Meanwhile, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is considering a bid for the White House, signaled support for a Medicare option at age 50. Asked about his view of the Medicare-for-all proposals that have been pushed by others in the Democratic party, Brown said he believes in universal coverage.
I really enjoy the freedom, he said last week. You have complete autonomy to do what you want to do.
—A new team of federal agents, computer experts and analysts are targeting online opioid sales, which law enforcement warns can be more persistent and vexing than more traditional trafficking by cartels, the Associated Press reports.
Now, as the House begins to hone details of its legislative proposal, a possible compromise has emerged. It would temporarily keep federal dollars flowing to cover almost the entire cost of the roughly 11 million Americans who have gained Medicaid coverage but would block that enhanced funding for any new participants.

Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency said it alerted the woman's surgeons soon after the infection soon was discovered. But officials at Cleveland Clinic, where the transplant was performed, say they weren't told for weeks, until after the organ was removed. And McFarland, 29, only learned about the allegations from a Post reporter.
Attitudes toward Obama are more complicated among white Democrats. Lifelong Democrat Doug Brafford, a retired lawyer who lives in Mount Pleasant, plans to support Buttigieg after backing Sanders in the primary four years ago. One of the things that upsets me about Joe Biden is that, as vice president, he repeatedly denigrated Southerners, said Brafford, 77. When Obama said that people cling to their guns and religion, Biden didn't speak out. He picked up where Obama left off. I love Obama with all my heart, but I think he's divisive – and that matters to me.
-- Nature abhors a vacuum. Key U.S. allies are nervous about Trump's isolationist rhetoric. They don't feel like they can trust America's security guarantee the way they could in the past. Anna Fifield reports this morning on an influential group of Japanese politicians who are seeking a stronger military response from Tokyo to North Korea, making the case that the pacifist country should acquire the ability to strike Pyongyang instead of having to rely on Washington. Japan can't just wait until it's destroyed, said one politician who supports the idea. It's legally possible for Japan to strike an enemy base that's launching a missile at us, but we don't have the equipment or the capability.

The pace of immunizations is rapidly increasing, nearing a rate of 2 million shots administered daily, and Biden promised this week that there will be enough vaccine doses for every American adult by May.
It's understandable that Collins wouldn't want to go there, given Whitaker's credentials. The patent company Whitaker advised before joining the Trump administration attempted to hype Bigfoot, time travel and a deep-bowl masculine toilet for well-endowed men. In response to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire before becoming a U.S. attorney in 2003, Whitaker listed his two most significant cases as a personal-injury case and a negligence claim against a dry cleaner.
As far as the confirmation goes for the rest of the week, tomorrow on January 11th, hearings begin in the morning and in the afternoon for Rex Tillerson as the next secretary of State and for Secretary Elaine Chao as the next secretary of Transportation. On Thursday, hearings will be for General James Mattis as secretary of Defense; Wilbur Roth as the next secretary of Commerce; Dr. Ben Carson, Housing and Urban Development; Congressman Mike Pompeo for the Central Intelligence Agency.
Warren supporters forced to make a second choice were as likely to move to Buttigieg as to Sanders, according to this analysis by my Post colleague Philip Bump. Supporters of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) went mostly to Biden and Buttigieg. Biden supporters went mostly to Buttigieg.

This applies both to the battle against Trump's authoritarian impulses and serial shredding of our democratic norms, and to the battle against the various ways in which Trump will work with Republicans to advance a more conventional GOP agenda. This blueprint has five crucial components:
The wait-and-see camp based on Republican behavior:
And at the end of the day, don't go to court. Can't we have common sense in America? That's the way it used to be. And there was a book written called The Death of Common Sense. We need to bring it back.
It's partly because they just haven't been able to take the hatred and fear their hardcore base feels for Biden and scale it up and out, which then affects their ability to whip up frenzied opposition to the things he's trying to do. And the broader context matters, too: When we're caught in a pandemic and an economic crisis, only so many people will get worked up about whether a transgender girl is allowed to play softball.
The department is providing a trove of data to the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, which draws together authorities in 12 regions across the country, that shows which doctors are prescribing the most, how far patients will travel to see them and whether any have died within 60 days of receiving one of their prescriptions, among other information, Sadie writes.
The acting drug policy chief's comments came as the administration announced top policy initiatives for combating the U.S. overdose crisis. Among those initiatives are addiction workforce expansion and prevention efforts, plans widely heralded by treatment experts as effective for grappling with drug misuse, Ian and Valerie write.
While many Democratic presidential candidates have embraced health-care proposals that go beyond the Affordable Care Act to offer universal coverage, defending the law against Republican efforts to dismantle it has proven to be a potent rallying cry and an effective unifying tool.
The White House has said Jackson (the doctor examining Trump) will appear at Tuesday's press briefing to take questions about the president's health after compiling detailed results over the long weekend.
Mathur said her and her colleagues' plan could be seen as a compromise between what Republicans have suggested and the plan Democrats are backing.
In the closing weeks of his campaign, Joe Biden visited the community of Warm Springs, Ga., a place beloved by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The October stop was not the first time Biden had drawn connections between himself and FDR. In July, Biden had told the New Yorker that, like FDR, he felt the weight of steering the country out of crisis and would likewise use tools that were pragmatic but ambitious. It is easy to hold those invocations as suspect — given that they were made by a centrist figure who embraces a help not handout philosophy — but for the sake of our imaginations we should entertain them, to build a world, if only in our minds, that Biden likely will not.
From an insurance standpoint, the biggest thing is stability for the plans that are deciding whether to remain, and if you don't have the cost-sharing subsidies for 2018 — and they have to file rates and make final decisions by June or July — I think it's going to be very hard for many plans to stay in, the lobbyist said.
— Gun control groups are shifting their attention toward preventing gun violence and suicide at the state level, after seeing little success in advancing federal gun legislation. Last week, Everytown for Gun Safety launched a campaign to educate people about red flag laws in various states that can help take guns away from people who are a risk to themselves or others, as our colleague Katie Zezima reports.
She said that the perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways. In one case, I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer. McSally recalled being ashamed and confused, blaming herself for the incident.
There's truth to the drug price reductions Trump boasted about last night, although it's too early to claim his proposals have made the difference. The consumer price index for prescription drugs fell by 0.6 percent in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As my colleague Glenn Kessler recently noted, that decline would be the first drop in 46 years in the December-to-December timeframe (although there have been other 12-month periods with index declines).
Those are ideas Republicans have broadly supported in the past, but the Craig-Peters bill doesn't include longstanding federal restrictions on when federal funding may be used for abortions. In a memo sent to GOP committee members last night, committee staff noted that omission and added that the bill isn't paid for.
According to federal rules, every state Medicaid program must cover women with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $30,000 for a family of three) on the basis of pregnancy. As a result, Medicaid covers a sizable share of births in the United States — more than 4 in 10.
oriented in a Congress that's not very solutions-oriented. There's politics of separation now, and I think he's the exception to that, and that's good.

In an odd twist, it is the Senate — traditionally the more moderate chamber, and the place where Northam's personal ties are strongest — that stands in his way, not the House.
In Rockland County, about 40 miles from Manhattan, there have been more than 150 confirmed cases, according to county health officials, Lindsey writes. More than 82 percent of the measles patients had not received a single dose of the MMR vaccine, health officials said. The data shows that the largest number of cases — 46 percent — were seen in children ages 4 to 18, and 39 percent of them were in children younger than 3.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on the 340B Drug Pricing Program on June 19.
Gorsuch's opinions favoring the owners of the Hobby Lobby craft stores and the nonprofit religious group Little Sisters of the Poor took the same sort of broad reading of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as the Supreme Court's conservative majority.
Obamacare continues to collapse, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at the White House briefing Tuesday, pointing to Anthem's decision in Ohio.
There is little evidence that Trump received awards for the environment. The White House pointed us to a self-published book by Trump's former environmental consultant. The only award mentioned in that book was from New Jersey Audubon — but the group denied it ever gave an award to Trump, the Trump National club in Bedminster or any of its employees. (This statement earned Four Pinocchios.)
The March 2016 baseline had indicated 18 million people would be on the Obamacare exchanges in 2018. But the January 2017 baseline scaled back the figure and estimated that 11 million people would participate in the exchanges in 2018, a huge drop.
1. Fund the government by Jan. 19: Congress could not agree on how to fund the government in 2018, so they kicked the can down the road. Now they have a little more than two weeks to either stall again or come to a bipartisan agreement.
Trump is in a rage over the scrutiny, decrying ridiculous partisan investigations at his State of the Union address Tuesday night and tweeting since then about a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX, a continuation of [a] Witch Hunt and PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT. Alleged Trump: The Dems and their committees are going 'nuts.' The Republicans never did this to President Obama.
— And here are a few more good reads:
I'd like to start by highlighting the president-elect has nominated 20 of 21 of the Cabinet-level positions. We've now held 39 mock hearings to prep the nominees that we've selected. In total, 4,830 questions have been asked during these mock hearings, with an average of 123 questions being asked per hearing. The team anticipates more than 15 additional mock hearings to occur in the upcoming week to ensure that our nominees are ready for the hearings.
TRUMP: That's why the people in Florida do not like him.
Trump's wife, Melania, who wore a powder-blue cashmere dress, their son Barron, 10, and the president's four adult children from his two previous marriages looked on, as did Vice President Pence and his family.
But those who know him say he lacks Scalia's combustible, combative style.
As far as we can tell, Trump has not commented on coverage for preexisting conditions since the efforts to repeal Obamacare flopped in late 2017. But that makes his stance even more remarkable.
Sanders reportedly confronted MSNBC president Phil Griffin and another network executive last week before the NBC-sponsored Democratic debate in Las Vegas to complain about its coverage, including disparaging comments made by Chris Matthews and 'Meet the Press' host Chuck Todd. MSNBC has not confirmed the encounters took place, though it hasn't disputed the report either, Paul Farhi and Jenna Johnson report. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told Vanity Fair last week that MSNBC 'is constantly undermining the Bernie Sanders campaign.' He has even said Fox News has been 'more fair than MSNBC' …
My guess is that somebody has convinced the president that this is good leverage, and the way to get health-care reform passed and get Democrats back on board is to basically use this cost-sharing subsidy as a little bit of a hostage, to force them to the table, said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a veteran GOP Senate staffer who has also worked for the insurer Cigna. I think that's maybe understandable, but I think that given the complex nature of health-care reform and what's going on on the hill — I don't think we've got that kind of time.
CVA also began pushing a specific policy agenda, calling for a VA accountability bill to make it easier to fire employees and choice legislation to give veterans more options for health care outside of the VA system.
I think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States, Romney tells host Larry Kudlow, now a member of Trump's administration. The man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn't the reason why.
In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.
Arizona is second on the Senate leader's worry list. As with Colorado, migration and immigration have changed this Western state from rancher red to suburban purple, with strong tinges of urban blue. In a special election to fill McCain's unfinished term, appointed incumbent Martha McSally (R) — the first female pilot to fly in combat — is slightly behind astronaut Mark Kelly (D), polls say.
Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.
There was a swift response from Republicans as well as from Howard Schultz, the billionaire coffee tycoon considering an independent presidential run. That's not American, the former Starbucks chief executive, said on CBS News. What's next? What industry are we going to abolish next? The coffee industry?
If you want to appeal to people in the Midwest, it is for the most part because people are looking at it as a security issue, Brodnitz said. If you want to raise it in Arizona, they are probably more likely to say it is more about the humane treatment of those at the border.
Here's how Katie breaks down the financial benefits, per the study, if pot were fully legal in all 50 states:
In 2015, Booker had supported the deal with allies to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Wednesday night, he didn't say what exactly he disliked about the deal, but he said he believed events on the ground have changed, requiring a different type of agreement. He criticized Trump for marching the country toward a more hostile environment in the Middle East.
Bloomberg is much better known for his work on smoking and obesity (where he has a mixed record) than on health insurance. Though it's true that the number of uninsured New Yorkers dropped from 1.8 million to 1.1 million while he was mayor, that's partly because of provisions in President Obama's health-care law — a law Bloomberg cheered at the time but obviously had no direct hand in passing.
That's why we should talk to the North Koreans, he said. Yes, [Trump] hasn't gotten them to stop developing weapons or anything, but I'd still rather have contact – and the same thing with China and the same thing with all of these countries.
KELLY: ... you praised in your book, The Art of the Deal.
It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people. And only after that is done can anything else happen.
Another area of sharp difference involves two oil and natural gas pipelines being planned in rural parts of Virginia. Perriello is against them, period. Northam won't disavow the pipelines — which his patron, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), has touted as a big source of jobs — but says they must be subjected to strict environmental review.
Initially, the problem wasn't that she couldn't afford coverage. She was a successful technology worker who spent time in Silicon Valley, starting her own consulting business after the 2000 dot-com bust. But she hesitated to apply for insurance on the individual market because she was overweight, which she thought could be viewed as a preexisting condition and disqualify her from getting covered again.
Obama's election and reelection made a powerful statement about the nation and its growing diversity. Trump, however, portrayed that statement as a threat. Whether he genuinely felt a sense of racial panic or just pretended to do so is irrelevant. That's how he played it, and he rode Obama-hatred to the White House.
The implication is that Blackburn will put Trump loyalty over the state's interests.
Bill Marler, a Seattle-based food safety lawyer, told Joel it's surprising the CDC has not yet been able to trace the origin of the contamination. It's 2018, and we're basically a month into this outbreak, and they can't link it to a farmer or a farm or a processor? I mean, candidly, that's ridiculous, Marler said.
FYI: Migrants aren't overrunning U.S. border towns, despite the political rhetoric, our colleague Arelis R. Hernández writes.
But the Senate, which did not face voters last year, remained firmly opposed, calling the House's work requirement a meaningless work suggestion because it would operate on the honor system.
And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.
The memorandum did not suggest that a President can never obstruct justice, Barr wrote. Quite the contrary, it expressed my belief that a President, just like anyone else, can obstruct justice if he or she engages in wrongful actions that impair the availability of evidence.
… for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
An IRGC statement broadcast on state television warned that any further American action would bring 'a painful response' ... It also threatened other countries housing U.S. bases, saying that they, too, would be hit with 'revenge' operations if any U.S. strikes were launched from them. … In using ballistic missiles, Iran relied on what the Defense Department considers one of its core capabilities. In a briefing held in November, a senior analyst focused on Iran told reporters at the Pentagon that the missiles constituted a primary component of Tehran's strategic deterrent.
And Gottlieb insisted spending more time with his family is the true reason for his departure.
The budget legislation containing repeal — which leaders plan to introduce in the Senate as early as Tuesday — will be a bare-bones outline of GOP spending priorities. It will also include very general instructions for committees in the House and Senate to write the actual bills repealing the law. The budget resolution can be passed by a simple majority, but McConnell is required to allow lawmakers to offer a nearly unlimited number of amendments in a process, known as a vote-a-rama, that could take up to a week to complete.
Reid shows no sign of easing into retirement. He walked onto the Senate floor Wednesday with wooden cane and, peering at his speech through black horn-rimmed spectacles, proceeded through his daily denunciation of the Republicans. He accused them (the party of Trump, whose pal is Putin) of trying to establish an oligarchy. From there he went on to host a photo op where he derided news photographers as a mob and to hold a news conference where he accused Senate Republicans of a ploy. The bile was bountiful — and it was only lunchtime.
Preserving the Medicare tax for five years, meanwhile, would give GOP leaders roughly $13.6 billion more to spend without affecting the bill's deficit savings, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, while keeping the 3.8 percent investment tax would add $68.7 billion during the same time period.
It's almost as if someone at the White House finally convinced Trump there's zero chance of Republicans repealing the Affordable Care Act while Democrats control the House. But even if Trump's prediction comes true -- and Republicans once again control both chambers of Congress (and Trump wins reelection) -- it's not at all clear they'd be able to agree on a repeal-and-replace bill.
For his trouble, Romney is something amounting to a pariah in the national Republican Party. Gallup pegged his approval among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters at 84 percent when he was the GOP nominee in November 2012. Now it has it at just 23 percent.
And Even Laster: EAT drINK MAN WOMAN: A high-scoring Style Invitational Loser taunts those who have won only honorable mentions. (Roy Ashley, Washington, who has more than 400 blots of ink)
Under questioning from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Barr said he was supportive of a barrier system across the border and he would likely support a law change that would allow for the detention of illegal immigrants accused of hurting or killing someone.
— Jan. 21, remarks at the CIA
-- An effort to tie electoral votes to the popular vote is gaining momentum. NPR's Sam Brasch reports: Democrats in Colorado and New Mexico are pushing ahead with legislation to pledge their 14 collective electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote — no matter who wins each state. The plan only goes into effect if the law passes in states representing an electoral majority. That threshold is 270 votes, which is the same number needed to win the presidency. … Proponents of the national popular vote measures have argued that it's not political, but Republicans, who have benefited in recent elections from the Electoral College system, disagree. … So far, 11 states — including New York, California and New Jersey — have joined the effort along with the District of Columbia, putting the effort 98 votes short of its goal.
The report also shows the ACA boosted incomes for those at the bottom of the income distribution, primarily through expanding Medicaid, the nation's health insurance program for the poor, to millions more Americans.
Yes, but not many and it's not easy. In 1974, the Senate adopted a procedure known as reconciliation that allows for expedited consideration of legislation related to spending, taxing and the federal debt limit. Under reconciliation, a simple majority is all that's required for passage. But the process has limits: The Byrd rule -- named for Robert Byrd, a Democratic senator who represented West Virginia for 51 years -- requires that all provisions in a reconciliation bill have an impact on federal revenue, spending and deficits, and that no extraneous provisions are included. That forced Democrats to drop Biden's proposal for a national $15 an hour minimum wage from the virus-relief package. Republicans used reconciliation to pass tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017, and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, achieved final passage only by using reconciliation. Democrats fear that priorities like measures on voting rights or immigration would not qualify for reconciliation.
Then there's Trump. He has given some seriously mixed signals on whether he wants to protect dreamers. Now, he is demanding money for his border wall in exchange for extending protections. A wall is a non-starter for most congressional Democrats and Republicans.
Trump decries that some insurance companies have announced they are leaving the Obamacare marketplace. But he ignores that many say they are exiting the business because of uncertainty created by the Trump administration, in particular whether it will continue to pay cost-sharing reductions to insurance companies. These payments help reduce co-pays and deductibles for low-income patients on the exchanges. Without those subsidies, insurance companies have to foot more of the bill.
I looked at polling dating to 2010 across several pollsters and found that positive and negative feelings about socialism are extremely constant. Opposition has been a consistent majority and as high as 58 percent, while support has never broken 40 percent.
Centrism or liberalism?: On a night when de Blasio and Warren sought to push the party to the left, Ryan used a few questions to take a relatively centrist position; he cast himself as the candidate for the forgotten blue collar voters. That choice is likely to define Thursday's debate, which will feature democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and establishment centrist and former vice president Joe Biden.
One America News is an obscure TV channel struggling to emerge from the cellar of the cable ratings, but it is nonetheless one of President Trump's favorite media outlets. It's not hard to see why: On One America newscasts, the Trump administration is a juggernaut of progress, a shining success with a daily drumbeat of achievements.
If the law were to be eliminated it would be total chaos, said former Ohio governor John Kasich, one of the leading Republicans to embrace parts of the ACA.
On Wednesday, she was the star guest for the Human Rights Campaign's lunch to honor LGBT elected officials. She received several standing ovations in her nine-minute remarks.
So what happens to a delegate that changes his or her mind?: Some states have laws requiring delegates to obey the will of primary voters. But , a political scientist who runs Frontloading HQ , told Power Up it's unclear if those laws are constitutional or how they would be enforced while the convention is actually happening.

Health 202: You've noted your district has more individual insurance marketplace enrollees than any other district in the country. Are you hoping to make any improvements to the ACA?
Leaders of the House's Pro-Choice Caucus, which boasts its largest membership ever, said this week they'll push for legislation scrapping the Hyde language, which for years has been attached on a bipartisan basis to federal appropriations bills. Hyde prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or if the woman's life is at stake.
This is the latest example of President Trump and Republicans in Congress destabilizing health-care coverage for the American people. Their constant attacks and intentional efforts to create uncertainty are pushing some plans to withdraw from the marketplace and others to raise premiums, Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said in a statement.
Nevertheless, there is a risk in overlearning the lessons of such past episodes, especially given the 50-50 Senate, with one or two Democratic moderates in the middle. Mr. Biden's aspiration remains the right one, even after an increasingly partisan week. Democrats laid the legal basis for passing Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion covid relief plan on a party-line basis, via the reconciliation process; that was followed by a Senate vote-arama featuring Republican amendments on made-for-campaign-ad issues such as aid to undocumented immigrants — and that was followed by a tough statement from Mr. Biden that he will not compromis[e] on a bill that's not up to the crisis.
Ryan said in a CBS News interview Wednesday that if Republicans don't unite, Trump would just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare.
Roberts had been warned about this sort of thing. The late Justice John Paul Stevens, in his Citizens United dissent, wrote: Americans may be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-government today.
First of all, one oddity of the CEA report is that it suggests that the ACA marketplaces are relatively stable, contrary to the president's frequent suggestion that Obamacare is collapsing. The report also noted that 85 percent of exchange buyers received a subsidy that shields them from premium increases – a fact that the president never mentions – and that many lower-income, able-bodied, working-age adults gained Medicaid coverage. But the report takes these positive facts and claims that the law thus has been a boon to insurance-company bottom lines.
Agreements and state intervention smoothed over the divorce, which won't be complete until next year, but people have had to pick sides: Highmark patients with UPMC doctors have had to switch plans, or switch doctors. UPMC health plan members have to pay out-of-network prices at Highmark's facilities. In the meantime, people have been bombarded by dueling ad campaigns and endless local news stories about the rift....The competitive clash has turned Pittsburgh into a testing ground for forces that are transforming health care nationally, as waves of consolidation blur traditional boundaries in the $3.3 trillion health-care system.
The president's daughter and senior adviser celebrated the launch of an initiative meant to bring economic security to women around the world:
The new administration disappointed some health advocates, however, with its recent decision to rescind guidelines that would have made it easier for doctors to prescribe an opioid-treatment drug. The Biden administration said that the guidelines, issued in the final days of the Trump administration, did not pass legal muster, although officials have indicated that they are looking at alternative approaches.
In a move that is likely to please conservatives, the draft also proposes repealing all of the ACA taxes except for its so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans in language similar to the House version. Senators had previously toyed with the idea of keeping some of the ACA's taxes.
The proposal is drawing fierce opposition from airlines, labor unions and lawmakers, Lori Aratani, Michael Laris and Ian Duncan report.
He also said he didn't know what would come after this job. It's the first time in my life I don't know what I'm doing next, he said. I'm a doctor so I always had my next job planned out, but this is truly the first time I'm leaving a job and I do not have a job.
To be fair, there were parts of Obamacare meant to reduce the amount of health care consumed and the prices charged for that care, and there have been modest gains in that direction. But primarily Obamacare was a big transfer of wealth from people who are rich, young and healthy to people who are poor, older and sick. Obama tried to soft-pedal that redistributive reality in trying to pass it, just as Republicans are now desperate to cover up that they are doing the same, only in reverse.
-- House Democrats are using Ken Starr's arguments to challenge the Trump administration's position that Congress is not entitled to grand jury records. Ann Marimow reports: On Monday, Starr, the former independent counsel who is part of Trump's team, reminded senators they do not sit as jurors and are in fact a 'court.' … Trump administration lawyers have been arguing the opposite in a pending lawsuit, House lawyers told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a new filing Tuesday. In court, the Justice Department has argued that a Senate impeachment trial is not a 'judicial proceeding' and therefore not exempt from secrecy rules that shield grand jury materials from disclosure. 'That argument has now been contradicted by the president's counsel's statements to the Senate, which confirm that the Senate sits as a 'court' rather than a 'legislative chamber' during an impeachment trial,' according to the filing.
The Brookings Institution holds an event on emerging policy solutions to surprise medical bills on Friday.
It's never too late to address problems, Race said, but the earlier you can catch them, the easier it is and the better results you'll have to put things back on track.
The move to hire Donald K. Stern, a former U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, follows allegations that the drugmaker tried to gain influence at the university with donations, Stat's Andrew Joseph reports. Public scrutiny over the Sackler family's ties to Tufts mounted after a Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey filed a lawsuit against Purdue last year and Sackler family members revealed that the company allegedly influenced educational and research programs at Tufts and sought to use the Tufts brand to bolster the company's, Andrew writes.
It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.

Senate Finance examined prices for some of the most commonly prescribed types of insulin. It found prices for Eli Lilly's short-acting Humalog increased 585 percent between 2001 and 2015. Novo Nordisk's Novolog – another short-acting insulin used during mealtimes – cost 87 percent more in 2019 compared to 2013.
This is an issue that women will wrap their arms around. They are typically the ones that are taking children to doctor's appointments . . . Women pay attention to health care and health care costs and right now in Iowa, it's very expensive, she added.

Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) apparently ripped up the House resolution, per C-SPAN's Jeremy Art:
But many attendees saw the president's overall strategy abroad in an unfavorable light.
Dick Woodruff, the American Cancer Society's senior vice president of federal advocacy, said in an interview that there are many reasons people could have a gap in coverage. He noted that between 40 and 85 percent of people with cancer stop working when they are receiving treatment, putting them at risk of losing their jobs, and some people may be uninsured at the time of their diagnosis.
Senator Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint. They are both running ads in this state focusing on that, focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems, showing images of people in Flint thankful that they're there.
— Meanwhile, two Republican attorneys general in Ohio and Montana filed a brief in federal appeals court opposing O'Connor's ruling that the ACA should be invalidated.
The majority party assigns a chairman for each of the Senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. But when the Senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its Republican and Democratic leaders -- Trent Lott of Mississippi and Tom Daschle of South Dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, and equal budgets for committee Republicans and Democrats, though the majority leader retained the right to advance a measure or nomination from a committee in the event of a tie vote. There could be an effort to reach a similar power-sharing agreement after Jan. 20.
Donald Trump made Dingell distraught. He saw the president as a clear and present danger to the United States of America. But he was even angrier about what he saw as the Republican-controlled House ignoring its constitutional responsibility to check the executive's authority.
Biden tried to argue that he opposed federally-required busing, and didn't want Washington to dictate policy to local governments. But Harris called him out on that argument, saying that racist state-level policies have held back African Americans for years and that it is the role of the federal government to intervene.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that everyone he knew in the Senate was in favor of keeping protections for preexisting conditions. (The Washington Post)
What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.
From former Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor:
When cap-and-trade failed in 2010, Inslee argues that it was just a line on the graph. Now people experience more frequent fires, flooding and hurricanes, plus worse air quality, so it feels real and thus they're inclined to act.
But -- and I used an example. And this isn't necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall's 50 feet high. Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet? That could very well be. That could very well -- he wants it to be higher.
In November, The Health 202 reported on ways the Trump administration could restrict abortion providers by putting new restrictions on the Title X family planning program.
The White House did the right thing. Ryan carried the luggage here. He delivered it and it was damaged goods, Ruddy said of the health legislation. They wanted to work with Congress, they accepted the congressional plan and it blew up on them. Now they realize they can't do that in the future.
Wednesday was a big, weird moment in the lurching transition of federal power. Did it reach peak weirdness when a group of protesters began to march around the U.S. Capitol in dinosaur costumes? Or was it reached only when President-elect Donald Trump, in Manhattan, denied kinky new allegations about himself by announcing that he was very much a germaphobe, by the way?
7. Are there Republicans who might vote with Democrats?
—Politico's Eliana Johnson and Burgess Everett also report the Trump administration's decision to back invalidating Obamacare was made despite objections from Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar and Attorney General William Barr. In a statement, however, HHS insisted there was no dispute.
Ernst told Barr she planned to introduce a bill — known as Sarah's Law — that would require illegal immigrants charged with crimes in which someone was injured or killed to be detained. The bill, Ernst said, is named after Sarah Root, who was killed by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The driver, Ernst said, was allowed to post bond in the case and has not been seen since.
The unrest extends to personnel and the Trump political operation. Last week, Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh left the White House to help prop up an outside group that aims to provide air cover for the president in the legislative battles ahead after a health-care effort that left him exposed to criticism from the left and the right.
Barr pledged in his first round of questioning that he would look into whether the FBI opened up a counterintelligence investigation that sought to determine whether Trump was seeking to help Russia.
Think it's too harsh to characterize Sanders as an extremist? Granted, he is more like Cruz than Trump. Ideologically motivated, Sanders sells fiction, and not in the way all candidates sometimes overpromise. He pledges to drastically reshape the federal government, doubling its size, and uses cocktail-napkin math to claim to pay for it. Sanders's program would cost some $60 trillion to $97 trillion over 10 years — expert estimates vary but none of them bring this plan into the realm of the practical. His wealth tax, one of his major tools to finance this expansion, would raise far less than he estimates — between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion less over 10 years, according to a University of Pennsylvania analysis.
Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019, the statement said.
For example, McConnell favored dropping a House provision that would end guaranteed protections for people with preexisting medical conditions, according to three Republicans familiar with the meeting. The House bill would allow states to seek waivers to opt out of a regulation requiring that such people may not be charged more for coverage. McConnell proposed the possibility of keeping waivers that pertain to other key regulations.

It's no secret how much Cruz loves all the Star Wars movies. He first referenced them during his 2013 Senate filibuster of Obamacare and even did an impression of Yoda ahead of the Force Awakens premiere.
By Thursday afternoon, 40 comments had been posted anonymously on the CDC internal announcement board applauding her return and suggesting that her HHS bosses should just make her the permanent director. (The only other announcement with more comments asked employees whether they work while sick.)
Legal experts say the case highlights the high stakes beyond abortion if a new conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court were to strike down Roe v. Wade, our colleagues write. University of San Diego law professor Dov Fox said the high court has been clear that fetuses are not people and that a woman's views on abortion trump her partner's because she is the one who carries and delivers the baby. But if fetuses are recognized as having rights equal to the women carrying them, it would open up a legal and ethical minefield.
The talks put Biden administration officials in the awkward position of having to defend a Trump order, under Title 42 of the public health code, that allows them to expel migrants from the southern border. In recent court filings, they called the expulsion authority a critical tool in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years, Trump said. But we must do more, the president added. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
And, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?

-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Schiff well spoken and said did a good job of creating a tapestry. But other Republican senators have told reporters that Schiff was overly smooth or slick, which they meant as negatives. In a way I do feel like I'm introducing myself to a number of the senators, Schiff told the Associated Press, adding that they're finding I'm not the demon that I'm portrayed as on Fox.
— There are now five drug companies that have accepted an invitation from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.) to testify before Congress.
The centerpiece of that agenda is Medicare-for-all, a politically toxic proposal that represents the only way Democrats could fumble away their health-care advantage over Trump. Democrats' pledge to preserve and expand on President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was a decisive factor in flipping the House from red to blue in 2018. Sanders would do the opposite, ditching Obamacare in favor of his single-payer, government-run proposal. This plan has steadily lost popularity over the past year and fares particularly poorly in the make-or-break Blue Wall states.
* Martin O'Malley: Early in the debate, I had the former Maryland governor pegged for the loser category because he was doing the one thing I hate: complaining about how little time he had to talk. The truth is that when one candidate is in the 50s in national polling, another is in the 40s and a third is in the, well, twos, the candidate in the twos shouldn't get as many questions.

[Note: After this fact check appeared, a White House official insisted it incorrectly suggested the administration was opposed to funding the CRSs. He pointed to a statement issued by the White House as well as a news article saying the president told lawmakers he was supportive. People involved in the debate tell a different story, saying the White House was inconsistent and confused in its approach, offering little leadership to ensure passage. The CEA report might be seen as part of this pattern. The official also faulted this fact check for not devoting more attention to the money earned by insurance companies by the Medicaid expansion. He pointed to an article in the Los Angeles Times that focused on the profits made in California by Centene and Anthem — profits that the state says it will take back in coming years.]
In the 2014 midterms, CVA featured the wait-time scandal in a large ad campaign and financed a Get Out The Veteran tour designed to drive up conservative turnout.
The Kansas decision is a significant signal from the Trump administration as to how far it will or won't allow states to go in putting more fences around their Medicaid programs. The state's push for lifetime limits is the first such proposal the administration has rejected, although other states including Arizona, Utah and Maine have made similar requests.
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), along with Health subcommittee Chair Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, expressed concern about the tragic and alarming spread of Ebola.

This would require making even hard drugs available for modest prices from regulated outlets, as well as a new focus on treatment rather than punishment for those addicted to these substances.
—On his way to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans, Trump tweeted his party would be the one to gain the upper hand on the issue. Several senators present told our colleagues the president spent much of his time at the Senate lunch talking about health care.
-- But OMB director Mick Mulvaney was at a loss to explain why so many of members of Trump's party were not prepared to vote for the health care bill. Still, he said that conservatives were not the only ones to blame: It was a bizarre combination of who was against this bill, some folks in the Freedom Caucus and then moderates on the other end of our spectrum, he said on Meet the Press.
We were hoping for more stability. The factors that I have described to you today lead to instability and to a spiral, and we think we are in the beginning of that, Burrell said.
Indeed, the Medicare-for-all plan endorsed by liberals is not even expected to get a hearing, much less a committee vote, in the pivotal House Energy and Commerce Committee, which technically has jurisdiction over health care. Rather, the proposal has been steered to the second-tier House Rules and Budget panels, which will vet the proposals without voting on them.
Chafin was elected to the House of Delegates in November 2013 and moved to the Senate nine months later, winning a special election for the seat that Democrat Phillip P. Puckett (Russell) abruptly resigned from in summer 2014.
Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a rally calling on the administration to defend the Afforable Care Act in a challenge from GOP-led states. Translation: they have no health care plan. It's the same old song they've been singing. They're for repeal. They have no replace.
In my mind, if it's good enough for a conservative like Mike Pence and Indiana, then it's good enough for Virginia, Fredericks wrote.
Wyden said reforms are needed to Medicare Part D. Why isn't Medicare negotiating? Wyden asked. Private Part D plans negotiate with drugmakers … I don't see how Part D, as structured today, is going to protect the senior and the taxpayer.
Whitehouse asked Barr to to review the Bork order closely in advance of the hearing so that we have a discussion about whether you have any objections to adopting such protection for the current special counsel.
We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.
The immigration Lindsey will show up, Graham said, referring to his historically conciliatory stance on immigration restructuring.
These bills either miss the mark or squander a real opportunity to advance solutions that have had bipartisan consensus, a Republican committee aide told Health 202.
— Unvaccinated children have been barred from public spaces in a New York county as the state deals with its largest measles outbreak in decades, our colleague Lindsey Bever reports.
Senate Bill 793 would prohibit flavored products not covered by the federal ban, including menthol-flavored cartridges and refillable, tank-based vaping systems that can be filled with flavored chemicals. It would also outlaw flavors for traditional combustible cigarettes and cigars, as well as for chewing tobacco and hookah pipes, the Los Angeles Times's Patrick McGreevy reports.
There's also a risk that telling people who had covid-19 to hold off on getting the vaccine could end up feeding into anti-vaxxer narratives. Some experts are reluctant to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine if they are eligible, especially given that vaccine hesitancy is widespread.
OUCH: There were 78 new measles cases reported in the first week of April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the total to 465 confirmed cases this year. It's already the highest number of cases in the last five years, our Post colleagues Reis Thebault reports.
Tarrant fired his lawyer and plans to represent himself in court, leading to speculation that he might try to use his trial as a platform for extremist views, Fifield reports from Christchurch.
Strengthen the military so that it's so big and so strong and so great that nobody's going to mess with us. (Trump has expanded military funding, and nobody has messed with us during his four years — although that was also the case in previous presidencies.)

However, Trump oversold what was still only the germ of an idea. Around the time of Trump's announcement, Google communications tweeted a statement from Verily, the life sciences division of Google parent company Alphabet that focuses on research and development concerning health issues: We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.
This statement lacks context. The auto and auto parts manufacturing sectors reached a peak of 1.3 million jobs in June 2000. The number of jobs decreased by more than half, to 623,000, in June 2009, the end of the Great Recession. The number of jobs now tops 1 million, but much of that growth predates Trump. Only about 55,000 auto and auto parts jobs have been created since he took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Pelosi's staff pointed to estimates by the Commission on Care's 2016 report on veterans' health and a 2014 Congressional Budget Office report. Those reports show that among 22 million veterans, there are 9 million enrolled in VA health care and another 7 million who are eligible but haven't enrolled.
It's worth noting — as Trump did at Monday's rally — that he once supported both men. He gave Ducey a resounding (if rote) vote of confidence in 2018 and helped propel Kemp to a victory in Georgia's Republican primary that year with an endorsement. But this is how things work in Trump's world: One day you're a hero. The next, you're a traitor.
House committee leaders also weighed in on the Justice Department move. This decision demonstrates a shocking disregard for the health and well-being of Americans across this country, said House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), and Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) in a statement.
A reporter for the Madison Capital Times added this:
For their single witness, Republicans brought in Rob Robertson, chief administrator of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. The organization for farmers and ranchers is offering an association health plan it says will cost 25 percent less than plans currently offered in the state's individual market and will cover a broad range of benefits including prescription drugs, emergency room visits and prenatal and maternity care.

So he's planning a class for children on how to doodle with chalk using the barracks's sidewalk as their canvas.
NIH Director Francis Collins and other NIH officials wrote that the effort will be part of the agency's Helping to End Addiction Long-term initiative (HEAL). Like most other pioneering scientific initiatives, HEAL will focus on a range of objectives, from short-term goals to research priorities that will take longer to bear fruit, they wrote. Yet, all will be aimed at the same ultimate vision: a nation of people with far less disabling pain and opioid addiction.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who announced the launch of the Country First PAC last month, told us in an interview he'd like to see two of Trump's biggest boosters Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — among the GOP candidates who face primary challengers.

— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.
Judge Christina Klinger ruled that the amendment violated a state requirement that restricts such measures to a single topic. The judge argued that the marijuana amendment was too far-reaching and would affect taxes, business licensing and hemp cultivation. Proponents of marijuana legalization in the state have said that they will appeal to the state Supreme Court.

Planned Parenthood, which is losing its longtime head Cecile Richards (who held the reins of the organization for 12 years and will retire in May), is also pushing measures in three states with Democratic-led legislatures — California, Hawaii and Rhode Island — and in seven more states where Republican majorities might make it hard for the group to gain traction, including Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.
-- Uncertainty around John McCain's health has Republicans preparing for the possibility of defending two Senate seats in Arizona, something they are already doing in Mississippi as they seek to improve on their 51-49 advantage in the midterm elections, Sean Sullivan notes. McCain's health has been shrouded in secrecy, leading many Republicans to privately wonder if he will remain in office beyond May 30. If he doesn't, there would probably be a special election for his seat in the fall. … In public, influential Republicans have been reluctant to speculate about McCain's future in the context of electoral politics out of respect to the Senate titan, who is beloved by many in the party. But privately, they have engaged in talks about who might replace him or run for his seat.
I think Jim Comey is an extremely gifted man who has served the country with distinction in many roles, but I thought to the extent that he actually announced the decision [not to charge Clinton], was wrong, Barr said. The other thing is, if you're not going to indict someone, you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person. That's not the way the department does business.

But: The longer this bill stews, the more time Republican senators have to stew over it. There's a reason Republican leaders wrote this bill in secret and only gave the Senate a week to look it over. They don't want senators to go home next week for the Fourth of July holiday and get berated by voters. It's a process that tends to make lawmakers less — not more — amenable to compromise. More time also gives opposition groups on both the right and left time to coalesce against the bill.

The settlement resolves a legal headache for Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, but several more remain for both companies, Sara writes. Bayer is fighting claims that its popular weedkiller Roundup causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers; uncertainty over the litigation and two adverse jury verdicts have depressed the company's stock price. Other lawsuits challenge the safety of two Bayer birth-control drugs. Johnson & Johnson faces lawsuits claiming its talcum-based baby powder causes cancer as well as claims over hip implants, pelvic mesh and diabetes medication.

Hospitals must also show the amount they're willing to accept in cash from patients, as well as the rate negotiated with insurers.

How blood analysis could help snakebite victims:
The researchers concluded that additional access to drug-abuse treatment was linked to a six percent lower overdose rate for states that allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid than in states that did not. That translated into 1,678 to 8,132 fewer deaths in those states from 2015 to 2017, they wrote in an examination of data from 49 states and the District of Columbia.

It's the safest move he could make, said Ryan Salzman, a politics professor at Northern Kentucky University. Anything that even appears he's going against President Trump on impeachment, in any way, would be the worst thing he could do for his reelection.
Challengers to Trump in 202o will find encouragement for this approach in polling showing how many Americans are embarrassed to have Trump as president. In January, the Quinnipiac poll found that 90 percent of voters say the president should be a good role model, but 67 percent don't think Trump is a good role model for their children.
The Republican Party has been free to take us for granted for many years, and the business community took the Republican Party for granted, said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). Timmons said it is bad enough that Republicans no longer support business on issues such as trade, immigration and infrastructure investment. At the same time, major corporations are scrambling to distance themselves from the Republican agenda on social issues — in particular, opposition to gay rights — that are offensive to many of their customers and employees.
And though the Food and Drug Administration can retain more than half of its workforce thanks to application fees paid by drug and device makers, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has cautioned the agency only has about three more weeks' worth of funding to draw down, Nicholas and Ike write.

It must start with the job market, an important mechanism through which we make social contributions and which provides us the means to support our families. We are just now exiting a period in which millions of American workers tried to find a job for six months or longer without success.

People like Ryan estimated their earnings for 2020 and ended up being way off, largely because of the extra $600 a week that Congress gave unemployed people from April through July. Workers like preschool teachers, teacher's aides, waiters and the self-employed often ended up making more on unemployment last spring than at their regular jobs. Now they owe the government money to repay some of their health subsidy.
TRUMP: CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out. I'm at 49. He's at 15. He tells me about 65 percent of the people. It's not 65 percent of the people. If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.
Confirming whether or not someone has had COVID already adds an unnecessary layer of red tape onto vaccine prioritization. Given that the prioritization is designed to get vaccine first to those people who are most likely to get infected and/or get very sick from infection, it makes sense to reduce the barriers to vaccinating this group as much as possible, Murray said.

For a time, it was a winning strategy, dramatically increasing the Chamber's visibility, influence and financial resources. Other business groups, jealous of its success, also drifted into the Republican orbit. And it worked. The period from 1994 to 2006 was, in many respects, a golden era for business lobbying. Taxes were cut, regulation was reduced and companies won new protections from lawsuits filed by consumers, shareholders and employees. Trade was expanded, and corporate megamergers easily won approval. New rulings made it easier for companies to beat back labor unions.
The Vatican and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have not issued any statements discouraging the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The Vatican in December issued guidelines saying that it was morally acceptable for Catholics to receive vaccines that used cell lines derived from aborted fetuses in their research and production if other vaccines were not available. The Vatican has made the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available to citizens of the city-state.

Here's what other smart lawyers are saying on social media:
March: Republicans unveil their proposal to repeal Obamacare.
Trump's hunch is not in line with current World Health Organization estimates, which found a crude mortality rate of between 3 and 4 percent. The WHO reports, While the true mortality of covid-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between three to four percent, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1 percent.
The vote remained open for an extra 45 minutes, just shy of the votes needed, until McConnell, who faced a strong primary challenge that year, relented, and his entire leadership team joined the two women in breaking the filibuster.
It provided a lot of coverage to a lot of people, he added.
On immigration, however, there are signs that some of Trump's most ardent supporters are becoming disenchanted with the president's failure to improve the worsening situation at the border after more than two years in office. The Department of Homeland Security said last month it was on track to apprehend 100,000 migrants at the border in March — the highest monthly total in a decade.
In fact, in the Boston area, we have a tradition of triple-deckers. In the old days, this often meant three generations living together, one per floor. If everyone was healthy, working parents enjoyed support, grandparents enjoyed companionship and children enjoyed attention. If anyone was unhealthy, there was a community to help. There were financial advantages as well. Any empty units could be rented. Elder care, child care and housing costs were all minimized.

If you have a 401(k) retirement account and are younger than 59½, you can withdraw as much as $100,000 without incurring the 10 percent penalty, which has been temporarily waived under the Cares Act. You'll still be on the hook for taxes, though.
One is we don't want to create more bureaucracy. That would just be, I think, an irresponsible use of the funding that we have available, Northam said. And the other thing is that we want to move forward with a carrot rather than a stick and we want to do everything we can to help people, to encourage them to get back into the workforce.

It is a complete terrible reversal when [people believe] religion is about politics when it's the other way around.
Conservatives such as Meadows have argued that refundable tax credits are too expensive and constitute a new federal entitlement, while advanceable credits, they say, are too prone to fraud and abuse. But both have been a part of past GOP plans — including Ryan's Better Way blueprint and an ACA replacement plan advanced by new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price when he was a House member, one that many conservatives, including Meadows, co-sponsored.
— Meanwhile, a new study published by the New England Journal of Medicine found e-cigarettes are nearly twice as effective as nicotine replacement therapies in helping smokers quit.
— In February, Buttigieg told ABC News's George Stephanopoulos the country should start with Medicare-for-all-who-want-it by making a government plan available in the individual marketplaces.

It still could be improved a great deal, but it's an open question of whether the Senate would fix it or make it worse, said Paul. I'm not excited about having taxpayer money going to insurance companies. That was a big part of Obamacare, and it's a big part of this.
Ahead of the 2012 election, founding president Pete Hegseth — now a Fox News contributor — argued that the issue that most worried veterans was the national debt.
Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.
CRUZ: Well, Chris, thank you for that question. Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy.

But he voted for her anyway.
1:30 p.m.: Barr says Trump is 'free to fire his officials that he's appointed,' but he wouldn't stand by if someone was removed to stop investigation
That's the approach preferred by Klobuchar, who said Monday in a CNN town hall that she favors offering more people a Medicaid-type plan – something Democrats tried to include in the Affordable Care Act but ultimately gave up on over GOP objections that it would give the government an oversized role in the nation's health-care system.
That definitely didn't result from any policy discussions, said a Republican close to the White House who also requested anonymity to speak candidly. It's not that his aides lack confidence in knowing what he wants, but what he wants today and what he wants tomorrow are not going to be the same thing.
The money will come from the National Institutes of Health's Helping to End Addiction Long-term initiative and will go to the University of Kentucky ($87 million); Boston Medical Center ($89 million); Columbia University ($86 million) and Ohio State University ($65.9 million), Lenny writes. Each university will work with at least 15 towns or counties in its state to design programs and assess how well they work.
One in 7 adults say that their households don't have enough to eat, a crisis exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. While lawmakers passed a relief package in December with $400 million to help supply food banks, billions in food aid expired at the end of year and food banks are bracing for cuts. The Post reported on people living with hunger.
The idea behind expanding association health plans was to make more widely available the type of coverage often offered to employees of big companies. Small businesses have typically struggled to provide affordable coverage for workers, given the small size of their risk pools.
And you refused to give them their money back. Why don't you tonight...

The change, intended to satisfy insurers and minimize the number of Americans who may drop their plans if the bill becomes law, received measured praise from some industry officials but sharp criticism from patient advocates.
Now, of course, it is perfectly possible that the bill will pass. But if enough Republicans flip at the last minute, it will be mostly because individual Republicans calculated that sinking the bill could harm the ability of Trump and the GOP to enact other items on their long-term agenda, which of course includes tax cuts and deregulation. It will have little to do with Trump's salesmanship or with the GOP bill's specifics, which, if anything, are losing support fast.
The House joined the Senate in passing legislation to end the partial government shutdown by temporarily funding federal agencies on Jan. 25. (Reuters)
And we also need a cheerleader.
Biden accurately noted that Bloomberg once called Obamacare a disgrace, though overall his criticisms have been nuanced.
OUCH: The FDA will release new standards for coronavirus booster shots in an effort to combat fast-spreading virus variants.
Given Trump's long-standing high metabolism for controversy and scandal, he is uniquely positioned to take advantage of a deadly pandemic in ways that previous presidents would never have considered, said Max Skidmore, a political science professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City and the author of a book on presidential responses to pandemics.
First, his voters will want to know: Did he do what he said he would on the important issues? That means delivering on Obamacare, a tax cut and border security.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) proved remarkably adept at ignoring Trump's controversies, comfortably tuning out the news media in his slow, steady walks through the Capitol corridors.

You won't believe how committed I am to make OxyContin a huge success, Sackler wrote in a 1999 email referenced in one such court document, Andrew writes. It is almost that I dedicated my life to it. After the initial launch phase, I will have to catch up with my private life again.
It would be expensive and possibly not particularly stable, Holtz-Eakin said in an interview. If the public-policy goal is to give people access to affordable insurance options, there's a set of people who would just not have access to that.
TRUMP: Very nice words, but happens to be wrong. CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that...
But despite the president's resistance to strengthening the nation's gun-control laws and the continued intransigence on the issue among Republicans, there's a sense that the tide is shifting, she writes. The House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill Wednesday to strengthen the country's gun-control laws, a measure with five Republican co-sponsors that was notably the eighth bill introduced this year.
— First in The Health 202: Antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List says 28 of the 30 House Democrats in districts won by Trump have consistently voted for abortion rights despite the president's strong actions against the controversial procedure. The group has graded these 28 Democrats with a F in a new congressional scorecard it will roll out today.
But, I said, This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like Third World countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.
There are no more excuses, Heritage Action said, sounding an ominous note for Republicans who have long promised to deliver on their years of repeal rhetoric.
Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.
It's just a speck. What the heck? Here's a check! (Mark Raffman)
Please please please avoid ferguson stories!!! Oakley wrote after OAN aired a report on Ferguson, Mo.'s battle with the Justice Department over reforms to the city's police and court systems following an officer's shooting of an unarmed black man. A story that aired three times on the channel made police look bad and Mr. H. has told all of us not to do that. Please just avoid ferguson stories all together.
The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health-care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing — or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill — would address that tension.
Here's a time lapse of the first-ever round-trip flight to the Southern Lights:
To many conservatives, wrote The Post's David Fahrenthold and Kate Zezima, the shutdown signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government.
Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke then came on stage in Dallas with his familiar staccato delivery. As he had in his own race, he scattered sentences in Spanish throughout his remarks. We need somebody who can bring us together and heal us. We need somebody who can restore the moral authority of the United States, he said. We need Joe Biden.
Of the 15 Democrats included in the analysis, a look at policy-related posts on social media found a range of 2 to 23 percent of candidates' policy posts have focused on health care. Sanders leads the list with 23 percent of his posts about policy including a mention of health care, including references to things like Medicare-for-all, the opioid crisis and women's health. Inslee trails the group, our colleagues found: 2 percent of his policy-related posts are about health care.
But the theme of Biden's inaugural address was putting differences aside, and the new president may have warmer thoughts these days for Roberts, who turns 66 next week. Roberts was the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the chief domestic accomplishment of the Obama-Biden administration.
Repairing foreign relations: Toward the end of the evening, the candidates plunged into a discussion of how they'd repair American foreign policy in the aftermath of President Trump's unorthodox approach to global relations.
A separate emergency loan program, meant as a bridge for small firms as they wait, was overwhelmed after receiving more than 3 million applications.

If Mueller believes he has sufficient evidence to indict Trump, but cannot indict a sitting President, expect the report he writes to be sufficiently politically damaging to make impeachment the only option, tweeted University of Alabama law professor Joyce Alene, who served as a U.S. attorney during the Obama years. The GOP didn't turn on Nixon until his crimes were clear.
The good news is there's a paper trail, there's a warrant, there's an application, there's judicial review, said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in an interview Monday with radio host Laura Ingraham, a die-hard Trump supporter. And right now the Justice Department is not controlled by President Obama. It's controlled by Jeff Sessions.
Yesterday, the big four leaders of the House and Senate — House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — met with top White House officials to discuss the situation and start laying out some of their top demands.
For the first time, the FDA developed sample labels for drug manufacturers to use when applying for approval for the nonprescription drug. Drugmakers must develop and test drug facts labels before applying for a new over-the-counter drug to show that consumers can understand how to use the product without the supervision of a health care professional, Gottlieb explained in a statement.
Speaking to employees at the CIA, Trump complained about news coverage showing his inauguration crowd was smaller than Barack Obama's crowd in 2009. Trump's crowd did not go all the way to the Washington Monument. No matter how you calculate it, Trump's crowd was significantly smaller than Obama's crowd — and the Women's March on Washington the next day.
-- Tone deaf: As she said bye to a group of child migrants in McAllen, Tex., the first lady told them: Good luck. When an employee at the facility told her that the average length of stay for the kids is currently 42 to 45 days, she responded: That's great. (HuffPost's Sara Boboltz)
In that instance, Trump urged two justices to recuse themselves from cases involving him. One of them, Sotomayor, had issued a dissent that Trump and others argued (speciously) had accused the court of being biased in favor of Trump. But on the other, involving Ginsburg, Trump was referring to a very real political problem. Ginsburg in 2016 offered some rather unvarnished comments about then-candidate Trump and later apologized.
It was hard to resist it, being brought into the inner circle of government, said Weber, then a close ally of Gingrich and DeLay in the House. When you are a Washington rep and you can say you are now in the room with the policymakers when they are dealing with the issues you are hired to care about, that's a powerful incentive.
It all has to do with 2020 and the election, Trump added. But I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of 'Let's hop a train to California.' 
Civil rights lawyer Schoen, who defended former Trump adviser Roger Stone, will handle Senate jurisdiction issues, while Castor will be responsible for the overall presentation and strategy, he said.
I think there is an envy on the part of progressives, and most Democrats, of the Republican media world, Sanders said. They have Fox News, of course. They have the Rupert Murdoch papers. You've got Sinclair, which is acquiring more all the time. So we're up against enormous opposition. And what many Democrats are beginning to sense is that you have to break through that. And what we're trying to do here is ahead of the curve.

If there's a message to be learned from 2018 on policy, it's health care, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after the lunch Tuesday. Let's become the party of health care.
Since then, OFA, which has spent years as a punching bag for Democrats who thought it diverted resources from the party, has earned surprising new status as a boogeyman. The rebuilt group has helped promote and organize protests and raucous town hall meetings to pressure Republican members of Congress. On Feb. 18, New York Post columnist Paul Sperry tied together what was publicly known to pin the protests on Obama and OFA.
What does Trump lose if Moore isn't confirmed? As best I can see, not much. To use a football analogy, Trump will be facing a second and 10 rather than a first and 10. No biggie.
Sept. 20. Trump tweets he would not support a bill if it did not include coverage of preexisting conditions.
I know Rick Saccone, said Lacey, who lives in nearby Elizabeth Township. He's not a golfing buddy, but he's a good man. But anyone who supports Trump isn't for me.
Our administration is committed to protecting and improving the lives of Medicaid recipients, Verma said.
The tax plan would slash rates across the board — by 20 percent for businesses and 33 percent for individuals, simplify the tax filing process and restructure the international tax code.
I experienced this myself when I was rising. I acted like a human being when no one cared. No one was watching me, it didn't matter. I got like a little bit of visibility and then some negative press cycles. And then people were like, Hey, you know, maybe you should like stick to the script. And then I stuck to the script for a little while, and then it didn't work for us. So then I started evincing more humanity again, and then we started rising again. And then here we are. And now I'm happy to say, like, I get to act like myself and like a human being most all of the time because it's worked for us. It's actually our major competitive advantage, relative to the field, that I seem like a human being speaking English in terms that most of us can understand. And, you know, that's what we need right now. So thank you for the question.
And Reid defended the false allegation he made in 2012 that Mitt Romney had not paid taxes for 10 years. I'd do it again, Reid said. He reasoned that it's one of his strengths to tell the truth, then added, Maybe not the truth – it's how I feel.
I think it's a combination of the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare [in Washington], and a post-2017 election hangover, said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Republicans, particularly those in the establishment, seem to be very depressed by last year's results and thus helpless about their ability to impact anything going on in Richmond.

This is psychopathy, former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka said on Sean Spicer's Newsmax show. Trump Derangement Syndrome is a clinical condition.
We know they don't pass those rebates on — or at least fully — to the consumers for whom they're intended, Jack Mozloom, vice president of advocacy communications at the National Community Pharmacists Association, told me. They're basically scooping the savings off the top and keeping it for themselves, and that's keeping the drug prices high.
Rank-and-file Republicans follow the president's lead and routinely change their views to match his, from Syrian airstrikes to talking with authoritarian leaders and free trade.
Maybe I'm foolish, but I thought Medicaid is for people living in poverty, Walker said.

The policy recommendations include boosting subsidies provided through the insurance marketplaces, creating a new fund to help subsidize extra-expensive patients and automatically enrolling and renewing coverage for people eligible for Medicaid and fully subsidized marketplace plans.
He also praised by name drugmakers who had lowered prices:
He's interpreting that as a personal endorsement, she added. Members of Congress vote their district; they don't necessarily vote their president. The powers of persuasion that worked on the campaign trail aren't going to seal the deal in Washington.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) separately announced on Tuesday that they would lift mask mandates and other coronavirus restrictions in their states. Texas and Mississippi are still among the top 10 states with the highest deaths per capita.
As the Senate passed its bill late Wednesday, the federal government was preparing to release jobless numbers Thursday morning that break the charts. A record 3.3. million Americans filed for unemployment last week, about five times what we saw during the Great Recession.
Even Sen. Shelly Caputo, the reliably party-line toting Republican from West Virginia, was moved to distance herself from that cynical win-at-any-cost strategy. I did not come to Washington to hurt people, she said.
I wanted to ask about the president-elect's call on Friday with Senate Rand Paul about the healthcare law. Didn't Mr. Trump endorse a measure that -- that would repeal and simultaneously replace Obamacare? And if so, what does that replacement look like? And is the meeting that he's holding today with Tom Price and Seema Verma and the vice president-elect about, you know, how to -- how to design that replacement plan?
Some policy experts believe the glitches could be avoided or at least partially mitigated by amending the legislation before it is signed into law, although their suggestions are contested.
A Roll Call columnist highlighted this statistic from the CNN poll:
SPICER: Whether it's her work at the United Way or serving both Bush and Reagan administrations, she understands how to mobilize her team and meet a mission.
In the past 10 to 12 years, the number of people reporting symptoms tied to major depression increased 52 percent among 12- to 17-year-olds and 63 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds. Among young adults, psychological distress and suicide-related thoughts or actions also rose by 70 percent.
The correspondence illustrates the tension between many insurers and states and the Trump administration as the ACA marketplaces where people without employer-sponsored coverage can buy subsidized coverage flounder in many states around the country.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said in an interview on Meet the Press last month that he was disturbed that Barr appears to be a big fan of taking people's property without due process.
We will refuse to provide assistance to foreign NGOs that give financial support to other foreign groups in the global abortion industry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. We will enforce a strict prohibition on backdoor funding schemes and end runs around our policy. American taxpayer dollars will not be used to underwrite abortions.
There's so much footage of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) espousing the opposite of what he says now back when he was an impeachment manager making the case against Bill Clinton in 1998:
Now, the way you create jobs is you make America the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business. If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, you will see a real plan to fix our taxes, to roll back regulations, to repeal and replace Obamacare, not just lines around the states. Serious policies and proposals.
The other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.
AUDIENCE: Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.
His basic insight, though — health insurance should be decoupled from employment — is sound. Alas, for reasons of both political necessity and ideology, he is incapable of incorporating it into a financially plausible proposal.
Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate. I hope that's what we will have here tonight. Let's have a policy debate...
Here he was — first week as governor — comforting me, and saying, 'Buddy, don't worry. I'm with ya, I'm with ya,'  Stanley said. He didn't have to spend that kind of political capital. . . . So I love the guy.
They're insisting that a woman — specifically a woman of color — be the running mate for whichever white man will probably be challenging Trump in November, the 19th reports. Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) said she hears from voters nationwide who want a black woman as vice president. She said such a pick is 'the only chance the Democratic Party has to win the presidency and to win down ballot.'
But the GOP did not want the CBO to switch to the more recent baseline because it might have resulted in less budget savings — and thus made it harder to pass the health-care bill (which failed anyway).
I don't want America to go back to the way it was under President Barack Obama, said Banyan, a retired transportation worker. Obamacare killed me. Dreamers — keep dreamin', you know?
So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.
A silver lining of Sanders's continuing attacks could be that Biden looks more moderate, which might work to his advantage in a general election match-up against Trump. It certainly makes it harder for the GOP to portray Biden as some kind of crypto socialist.
It's very unusual or precedented – in my recollection – that a population for what is perceived to be a rare disease would grow to a point where it ends up being 10 times the cap for orphan drug designation, said Bernard Munos, a former corporate strategy advisor at Eli Lilly.
Three major insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk say they're cooperating with a congressional investigation into their insulin prices and details about the rebates paid in the drug-supply chain, Peter adds. Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it would start to sell a generic version of Humalog at half the list price of the brand-name version.
We really want to ensure there aren't any other destabilizing changes as we go toward the next open enrollment, Haltmeyer added.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar delivers the keynote address at the Council for Affordable Health Coverage and the Partnership for Employer-Sponsored Coverage's summit on health policies and politics in the 116th Congress.
While prices for some services would go up under this scenario, the most expensive services would be slashed so dramatically it would more than make up the difference, the researchers found. That's because the most expensive health-care claims are proportionally more expensive than the cheapest claims are cheap.

The 37th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference continues in San Francisco.
Wearing a bright red dress, Clinton spoke in strikingly personal terms about how her mother was intensely involved in her childhood, from soccer games to church on Sunday. She vowed to voters that she would be there for them as well. I am voting for a woman who has spent her entire life fighting for families and children, said Clinton, who serves as vice chair of her family's foundation. I'm voting for a woman who knows that women's rights are human rights and who knows LGBT rights are human rights. . . . I'm voting for a fighter who never, ever gives up and believes that we can always do better, if we come together and work together.
It's the latest development in a brewing controversy around the supplement. Advocates have hailed kratom as a pain remedy that is safer than opioids, but the FDA warns it is a dangerous and unregulated drug that can result in a opioid-like abuse and death. Laurie and Katie Zezima reported in February that the DEA was weighing whether to add kratom to the same category of illegal drugs as heroin.
Everything is in motion. Each poll seems to produce a new front-runner. But the margins are narrow, and with just about two weeks to go, it is more instructive to pay attention to the unusually high number of people — nearly 60 percent in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN survey — who have yet to lock in on their final choice.
I will say in all of my time in the Senate, I don't believe I have ever bellowed or yelled at a colleague on the Senate floor, and I hope I never do that, Cruz said.
He's not going to get what he wants, and he'll blame Republicans, the aide said.
That risky decision paid off, so well in fact that today, McConnell is basically bragging about it.
No, Barr responded, and then, unprompted, added, and I'd like to make a point about the witch hunt.
-- Barr acknowledged that the DOJ has created an intake process to vet dirt provided by Rudy Giuliani on Joe and Hunter Biden. Matt Zapotosky and Barrett report: Barr confirmed an assertion made Sunday by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that the Justice Department had 'created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified.' … 'That is true for all information that comes to the department relating to the Ukraine, including anything Mr. Giuliani might provide,' Barr said. He did not provide any other specifics. A Justice Department official said Giuliani had 'recently' shared information with federal law enforcement officials through the process described by Barr. Two people familiar with the matter said the information is being routed to the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh. …
We need to be willing to embrace actions in the setting of opioids that we must accept would be unsuitable to any other drug category, he added. He suggested the development of abuse-deterrent properties in new drugs to make them better than traditional opioids.
Thomas A. Saunders III, chairman of the Heritage Foundation's Board of Trustees, said in a statement that the 22-member board unanimously requested and received the resignation of DeMint, the firebrand former senator from South Carolina. Heritage founder Ed Feulner will serve in his place until a permanent successor is chosen.
Having a mental health disability doesn't mean they're bad, dangerous or unhinged, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law said yesterday.
There is support for some of the state-level regulations that have emerged: Sixty-nine percent of Americans support laws that require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and 49 percent support laws that ban abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected. But support for these laws drop once people hear some of the counterarguments.
Barr then stressed we can't stay in the current situation, and called on Congress to pass a law that will resolve nationwide how law enforcement should treat marijuana.
No calls, no comments, said Kilgore, who contends his struggling coal-country district wants the hand up as long as Medicaid recipients are required to work and make co-pays.
Meehan ... also said that he initially reacted 'poorly' when he found out that the longtime aide, decades younger, had begun a serious relationship with another man and might leave his office. He released a heartfelt letter he wrote to her in May in which he wished her well, thanked God for putting you into my life, and signed it, 'With all my heart, Patrick.' The congressman went on to recount that any hostility he may have exhibited stemmed from stress around high-pressure votes last year over the Affordable Care Act.  The Inquirer has a copy of the congressman's full hand-written letter to the former aide, which really deserves a read.
The problem here is clear: Prescription drug prices just keep going up. Prices for the medications we need to keep ourselves and our family members healthy, and often to save our lives, have increased 33 percent since 2014. They're rising faster than other medical services, including inpatient hospital care, and the problem has only gotten worse during the pandemic. In the past year, drug companies have actually increased prices on 245 medications, including lifesaving cancer drugs and — I kid you not — some medications that are being used to treat covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Shalala: Absolutely. Whether you can sell that politically …[but] we also have to be respectful of the research dimension of the pharmaceuticals. I do not want to destroy the industry in the process because they've got a pipeline that's important to everyone in this country, in the world. But I'm not anxious to pay for their 'D.' I'm happy to pay for their 'R.' The rest of the world, it's been cost shifting onto us, as the president has pointed out and as the rest of us have pointed out over the years. The rest of the world … they are negotiating on the basis of volume and they're getting lower prices and not paying for the 'R' part. American taxpayers are paying for the research part.
As a reminder, the president-elect will hold a press conference tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Midtown, New York. We will be sending out confirmation e-mails regarding this later today. The president-elect will address how he's handling the transfer of his business to focus on the country and getting Americans back to work for American growth.
But there are any number of other factions in the House GOP conference that could reasonably jump into the leadership race. Does a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus get a chance to govern? A Trump loyalist? A never-Trumper? To a certain number of Republican lawmakers, any one of those makes sense.
Schumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative Democrats such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.
1. Who controls a 50-50 Senate?
6. Can any bills make it around the filibuster?
It really is going to harm the adults in the expansion population, said Jerry Vitti, founder of Healthcare Financial, a company that connects people with public benefit programs.
Earlier this week, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) sent a letter to President Trump signed by 169 House members and 49 senators praising the president for his actions and urging him to veto any bills that might expand access to abortion. Daines, one of the scheduled speakers at a rally before the march, told me he plans to announce a formal effort to mobilize antiabortion senators around the issue.

KELLY: But the point I'm going for is you change your tune on so many things, and that has some people saying, what is his core?
The move — the first in a series of changes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to make in the next few days — underscores the degree to which Republicans need to retool their health bill if they hope to pass it this week.
-- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is delaying his departure from the Justice Department. NBC News's Julia Ainsley and Pete Williams report: Rosenstein had previously said he would leave in mid-March, noting during a public appearance on March 7 that it would be one of his final speeches. Rosenstein recently discussed his upcoming planned departure with Attorney General William Barr, after which it was decided that he would stay on a little longer, [a senior Justice] official said. … Asked whether the delay in Rosenstein's departure means that Mueller is still not ready to deliver his report, the official declined to comment.
Responding to Biden's attack, Sanders categorically denied that he ever considered a primary challenge against Obama. The Atlantic reported last week that the president's 2012 reelection campaign was panicked about the possibility after being tipped off by Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) that Sanders was seriously considering it, and they took it seriously enough that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was enlisted to dissuade Sanders from running.
If you are like the vast majority American workers who earn less than $127,200 in annual wages and salaries, you pay a 7.65 percent payroll tax as your contribution to the Social Security and Medicare program. It is taken right out of your paycheck, in that box labeled FICA. But if you are one of the top 10 percent of wage earners who has a higher salary, you don't pay the payroll tax on whatever is over that cutoff. In addition you pay no tax on income that comes from dividends or capital gains -- profits from buying and selling stocks, bonds, real estate and shares in private equity and hedge funds.
Even in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, the Trump Administration continues to ask the court to destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions and tear away health coverage from tens of millions of Americans, she said in a statement, calling the law even more critical during a dangerous epidemic.
I'm a very big person when it comes to the environment. I have received awards on the environment.
Sanders was candid during his news conference in Burlington about his failure to bring new voters into the process the way he needs. I will be honest with you: We have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process, he told reporters. It is not easy.
There's two notable Democrats still making a decision: Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams.
Barr said he would like Mueller's findings to become public, though he stopped short of guaranteeing he would make them so.
On Thursday, McCarthy hesitated when asked to describe a conversation he had with Trump about his party of health care declaration.
— Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino announced he is resigning from Congress this month to take a gig in the private sector, just weeks after he was elected to a fifth term, our Post colleague Mike DeBonis reports.
Week 1385, alter a place name
The suggestion is that this is pork. But Democrats argue the mass-transit funding is designed to offset revenue shortfalls so that transit systems can continue operating. Transit agencies have also had trouble covering all of their share of costs for capital projects. The New York State bridge is a vital crossing between the United States and Canada that has seen toll revenues plummet as a result of pandemic travel restrictions, one Democratic aide said. Without additional funds, the bridge would likely close.
Despite the cold, Malachi Cutchember, 11, was clutching a soda from Five Guys as he and his mother Kartrail, 33, crossed a street nearby. Kartrail Cutchember works at a nearby Nestle ice cream factory as an industrial engineer.
The best argument for confirming Barr is Whitaker, said one Republican involved in the discussions.
While a subset of seniors with privately based Medicare Advantage plans have varying degrees of telehealth coverage, the traditional Medicare program doesn't pay providers for telehealth when it's delivered to patients in urban or suburban areas. Except for patients with stroke and end-stage renal disease, recipients of virtual care must be in a rural area as designated by the U.S. Census for the provider to get paid by Medicare.
At another point in the call, McCarthy again suggested the health-care issue was decisive: Republicans carried the economy overwhelmingly. We carried even immigration. We even carried the social issues. But there was one issue we lost overwhelmingly — it was health care by 66 points. Had we lost health care just by 34 points, we'd still be in the majority. We'd have those other 80,000 votes that we needed.
This statistic is courtesy of another dubious report issued by HHS, though Trump hyped it up even more. The report did not say 2 million people dropped out. Instead, it said that 10.3 million had paid for their first premium in February as of March 15, compared with 12.2 million who had signed up for coverage as of Jan. 31.
We asked specifically if respondents wished physical harm against both kinds of political opponents.
They played frantic police radio calls warning that 'we've lost the line,' body camera footage showing an officer pummeled with poles and fists on the West Front of the Capitol, and silent security tape from inside showing [Vice President Mike] Pence, his family and members of the House and Senate racing to evacuate as the mob closed in, chanting: 'Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!' the New York Times's Nick Fandos reports.
But the uneven enrollment figures could be seen as evidence that the Trump administration, while not destroying the marketplaces, could be doing more to promote them. And the president isn't helping the situation.
If President Trump is reelected and replaces even one liberal justice, a larger conservative majority could go much further. The court could strike down Obamacare — it agreed last month to hear a case challenging it — and continue the deconstruction of the social safety net that poor and middle-class Americans rely on (for example, by holding that Congress lacks the constitutional authority to pass sweeping laws like the federal minimum wage).
Dach acknowledged there's a conversation to be had around the broader goal of expanding coverage to all Americans through a massive expansion of Medicare or Medicaid. That conversation should begin, he told me, but it shouldn't distract Democrats from taking on issues right in front of them — especially considering that House Democrats will have to work with the GOP-led Senate and the White House to actually write any new laws.
I don't think she was strong enough for the community, said Erie Rambert, a 72-year-old retired federal worker, adding that Edwards didn't seem to frequent community events.
-- Inslee said he welcomes Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal for its ambition and for drawing attention to his pet issue, but he said there's not really a plan for him to endorse. This was not a policy document. It was really not meant to be, he said. So now people like me will issue policies to actually put meat on the bones.

To use a timely metaphor, it appears that the Biden administration has developed powerful antibodies against infection by bad ideas and suboptimal personnel, especially ones from the Obama years that in retrospect look far worse than they did twelve years ago. It's not that Biden won't be exposed, but when he is, a strong immune system kicks into gear to fight off the assault.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said President Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment Cohen had made to the adult-actress Stormy Daniels:
The video also continues the theme of Cruz's post-campaign rhetoric: that nothing about his message needs to change. The 2016 primary season, already, is described as a fluke where Cruz outworked everyone but an out-of-control media anointed Donald Trump.
Barr also took a gentle approach to Justice Department leaks, acknowledging that it's a difficult one to address.
TRUMP: Don't worry about it, little Marco.
'Although I authored Brand X, 'it is never too late to 'surrende[r] former views to a better considered position,' Thomas wrote in his Monday dissent, quoting himself from a 2018 opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc, Fox reports. Thomas has recently been quite vocal in advocating for the court to overturn a variety of precedents, saying in one opinion last year that when 'faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.'
Stanley's bill would have extended the state's certification of the hospital, which closed in September, for another year — a measure meant to make the property more marketable. He said the hospital's plight had nothing to do Medicaid. It mostly served elderly Medicare patients and made a profit, closing only because of mismanagement by its out-of-state owner, Stanley said.
— Democrats and liberal groups are targeting Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) for her support of Brett M. Kavanaugh after the newest addition to the Supreme Court dissented in a 5-to-4 vote to block a restrictive Louisiana abortion law.
That's due in part to a fluke of the election calendar: On the ballot with Northam last year were all 100 House of Delegates seats. A blue tidal wave shrank the GOP's 66-to-34 majority to 51 to 49. A chastened House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), seeking to rebrand Republicans as results-oriented pragmatists, came out in favor of expansion if work requirements, co-pays and other conservative strings were attached. Nineteen House Republicans joined Democrats to pass a budget bill that includes it.
To If I Only Had a Brain
I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don't know. By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq. But Afghanistan, I felt -- and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day. OK? Second question? KELLY: There are several examples, Mr. Trump.
In her piece, published in USA Today, McCain said the institute would strive to fulfill her husband's mission of serving a cause greater than ourselves, a theme that was highlighted during memorial services for her husband.
Bloomberg: Let me finish, thank you. I was in favor of it. I thought it didn't do — go as far as we should.
Andrew Yang: So Alaska, which has had this dividend in effect for almost 40 years, where now everyone in the state gets between $1,000 and $2,000 a year in oil money, passed this and said everyone is going to get it from the richest Alaskan to the poorest. And there are many, many benefits to this. There is no stigma attached to it. There's no need to report your income or any changes in your circumstances. It's not that I'm paying for it, and you're getting it. And it's universally popular. So here in the U.S., if we say everyone gets a $1,000 a month as a right of citizenship, then that's something that everyone can get excited about immediately.
Direct the secretary of the treasury to label China a currency manipulator. (This was eventually done — albeit after Trump delayed such an action — and it was soon rescinded as a result of trade war negotiations.)
The public's increasing reliance on the ACA was reflected in the dramatic failure of congressional Republicans to roll back the law or even unify around a plan to replace it as it has grown in popularity.
Watch SNL's Stormy Daniel's cold open, annotated:
It's hard to overstate the disconnect between Capitol Hill Republicans and the administration on this topic. It's almost as if the White House has no recollection that just two years ago, when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, their fraught attempt to repeal and replace the ACA failed badly — and embarrassingly.
For instance, that bill eliminated the tax penalties, tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies central to the ACA's individual mandate to purchase health insurance. But because the budget rules do not allow for unrelated language, the mandate itself was not repealed.
I don't care about my grandkids, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) recalled one voter saying at a town-hall meeting, after Schweikert had explained that entitlements needed to be cut so debt would not overwhelm future generations. I want every dime, the man said.
Faith-based agencies play an important role in foster care and adoption in the United States, and in some parts of the country are the dominant providers, Ariana writes. Religious leaders say that HHS's requested changes would not prevent qualified individuals from becoming adoptive and foster parents because there are many other agencies that will accept them.
Some details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus's spread. Until now, the vast majority of the people had been older than 60 and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All of them had been in Hubei province … But the latest announcement said that 36-year-old man from Wuhan, identified only by his family name, Li, died on Thursday. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions, and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on Jan. 9.
-- The latest revelations offer a fresh reminder that the president's culpability for any alleged wrongdoing would almost certainly wind up being a political matter decided by the legislative branch. That heightens the significance of the November elections.
Among the big banks themselves, the fate of their surprisingly large tax breaks remains an open question. Citigroup, in announcing its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, reported taking a one-time, $22 billion hit from the reconfigured tax code. But the bank expects to see a significant lift. Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, CEO Michael Corbat said in a statement, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.
After a year of health care sabotage, topped off with the damaging health care changes included in the Republican tax bill to give tax breaks to massive corporations and the wealthiest, health care in our country is in a very different place than it was a few months ago Murray said in a statement provided to The Health 202.
For me, this is not a criticism. Providing resources to families, businesses, community institutions and states is certainly the fastest way to encourage economic recovery. This approach increases the positive influence of government while maximizing the authority and choice of individuals. It encourages social justice without massively expanding the size and role of federal bureaucracies. In many aspects, this is what used to be called the empowerment agenda: providing individuals, businesses and community institutions with the resources to improve the quality of life around them.
So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?
It's a strategy they could pay a price for. Polling shows that a majority of Americans blame the GOP and Trump for the shutdown. Republicans seem to be jammed between that political reality and their deathly aversion to angering the president. Senate Republicans could try to end the shutdown by passing a clean government funding bill, but doing so would come at a significant cost to the president's political capital.
Then she asked what he smoked.
Michael McCleary, a longtime hotel concierge worker at a prominent Washington, D.C., hotel, applied for unemployment insurance on March 20. At first, the system said he had an unresolved issue and would be contacted if more information was needed. He called the office daily to try to fix it. On Thursday, he waited on hold for nearly three hours only to be disconnected.
What we're seeing here is old-guard leadership trying to marginalize some of the big change agents who were elected in 2018 because they're afraid of what it means to their leadership in the future, said Charles Chamberlain, chair of the liberal group Democracy for America.
It is getting worse by the day, and it will keep getting worse unless we act, he said. We need to rescue people from this collapsing law, and we need to replace it with a true patient-centered system.
We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.
Warnock is fond of telling crowds that Jesus healed the sick, even those with preexisting conditions. He wants college to be cheaper because he went to Morehouse on the full faith scholarship which means he didn't have enough money for the first semester. It works on multiple levels. If you are a progressive hoping for the same policy outcomes, Warnock is speaking your language. If you want someone who understands your culture because he comes from where you come from, that works, too.
-- A car struck a police vehicle on the Champs-Elysees in Paris yesterday and exploded upon impact. James McCauley reports: Police were treating the incident as a deliberate act, and the Paris prosecutor opened a terrorism investigation. The driver, whose identity was not immediately released, was killed in the crash, Gerard Collomb, France's interior minister, told reporters at the scene. No one else was injured, Paris police sources said. Police said the attacker — who was 31 and from the northwestern Paris suburb of Argenteuil — was known to French authorities, the Associated Press reported. He was reportedly listed on the government's 'Fiche S,' a dossier of people suspected of posing a threat to national security.
The day after announcing his 2012 candidacy, Romney dismisses Trump's birtherism in an interview on CNBC.
But the president offered leeway in enforcing the mandate hours after his inauguration in January, when he signed an executive order instructing agencies to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens associated with the ACA, in part by acting to waive, defer, grant ­exemptions from or delay its rules.
When [Trump] first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.' And what we did was, we focused on, instead of religion, danger — the areas of the world that create danger for us. … And that's what the ban is based on. It's not based on religion. It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.
The House Ways and Means Committee holds a hearing on the Medicare Advantage Program.
One of Silverman's most illuminating exchanges did not take place on a TV set or a stage. In 2017, early in Trump's first term, she tweeted about her desire to connect and communicate more with the president's supporters. Jeremy Jamrozy, a San Antonio man, did not appreciate the idea. He responded with a nasty epithet that began with the letter c. Silverman could have slammed or blocked him. Instead, she scrolled through Jamrozy's online history and contacted him.
The company let him keep his coverage until 2014, when the first ACA marketplace plans kicked in and the law's insurance changes went into effect. Those included the rule that insurance companies could no longer deny a person insurance because of preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes.
Week 1383, pair a sentence from the paper with a question it could answer
Beyond program design, the radicalization of the Republican Party has made Obamacare vulnerable. As Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson argue, this is not your grandfather's Republican Party. Today, activist groups and major donors in the Republican Party encourage conservatives to fight on against social welfare programs, even if success seems unlikely.
One provision that spells out how the Medicaid program could be converted to a block grant, for example, would allow states to spend any leftover money on an item that is not related to health care, as long as they meet quality standards set by the Department of Health and Human Services. The state must also ensure that it is spending as much on health care as it has in previous years.
-- Commentary from the opinion page:
Look, I'm going to try to get something done, Scott told my colleagues. But I think it accelerates everything if the White House had a plan.
It's a small consolation for Warren, but she outlasted Bloomberg in the race after torpedoing his candidacy during the Las Vegas debate. That's a moral victory of sorts for Warren, who ran as a populist, just as it was for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) when she stayed in the race half a day longer than Pete Buttigieg, whose success in the race as the former mayor of a small town deeply annoyed her because she didn't think a woman with his same profile would have made it that far.
The U.S. now plans to keep working with Kurdish fighters in Syria, despite Turkish threats to cross the border and attack the Kurds, the U.S. officials said. The proposal could keep as many as 1,000 American forces, spread from the north of Syria to the south, they said.
Why Republicans care so much about reconciliation
Ed O'Keefe, Robert Costa, Paul Kane and David Weigel contributed to this report.
When Trump eventually tweeted about the meeting, he made no mention of Jamal Khashoggi:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday took the needed procedural step to soon hold a vote on the package, which could occur as late as Tuesday. The bill is unlikely to be approved by the Senate because it will require 60 votes to advance and Democrats say they oppose the Republican crafted deal.
Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) sent a handwritten letter to his local paper to explain why he dozed off during jury duty:
Mitch McConnell made lots of eye contact with Adam Schiff:
OOF: Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) revealed during a Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing that she was raped by a superior officer during her service in the Air Force. During the hearing, she told witnesses there to testify about their own assaults while serving in the military that she shares the disgust of the failures of the military system and many commanders who failed in their responsibilities.
A HuffPost reporter and polling editor reminded her Twitter followers of this:
The news rallied defenders of the law into action and raised questions among legal scholars about the likelihood it would succeed. Andy Slavitt, who led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama, called the action the biggest health care news of the year on Twitter.
In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the weakest GOP incumbent, is best remembered for taking every position possible on Obamacare. He sports a lousy 37 percent approval rating and an even worse deserves to be reelected score of only 24 percent, according to Morning Consult polling. In a state Hillary Clinton won with the help of organized labor, it is far from clear that Trump's campaigning for Heller will be helpful.
I think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
From Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who worked with Dingell as a fellow congressman and as Obama's chief of staff:
The hospital business is booming on Capitol Hill like never before. Lawmakers showered the industry with more than $275 billion last year, and handed hospitals wins even on seemingly unrelated issues. And Democrats' agenda will almost certainly be better for their bottom lines, Stat News's Rachel Cohrs reports.
The agency is implementing some long-term contingency efforts to increase excepted inspections during the shutdown, Helena writes. Facilities that handle high-risk foods are typically not inspected very frequently, even when the government is fully funded. The FDA is required by law to inspect all high-risk food facilities every three years, she adds. Routine food safety inspections of food facilities not deemed high-risk, such as bakeries, will continue to be suspended during the lapse in funding.
There have been a lot of conversations, there's been a lot of emotion and there are some politics associated with what's before us today, he said. But in my opinion this is not Obamacare Medicaid expansion because it creates a process for an orderly expansion.
Not so spoiled: This fight over the role and power of superdelegates has been around for a long time. And it's true they have yet to play spoiler before by breaking from the decision made by primary and caucus voters.
Gorsuch would like to curb the deference that courts give to federal agencies and is most noted for a strong defense of religious exemptions in cases brought by private companies and religious nonprofit groups objecting to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act.
Becerra said the rule would deny patients access to critical health care services and prevents doctors from providing comprehensive and accurate information about medical care. In a statement, officials from Oregon, one of the states in the other suit, said the changes would require health clinics to open another location, or create a separate entrance for patients, have separate examination rooms, hire separate personnel to work at separate workstations, maintain a separate phone number and website, and have separate electronic medical systems in order to continue to accept Title X funds.
Naturally, Trump blamed Democrats this past week, accusing them of supporting illegal immigrants over hard-working Americans. But both House and Senate Republicans are divided on immigration. In the House, over two dozen Republican representatives recently called on Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to put a DACA bill on the floor. Across the Capitol, nine Senate Republicans joined a bipartisan group this week to pressure McConnell to commit to DACA action.
Crowd estimates are difficult, but attendance for Trump's speech appears to be at least 80 percent smaller than Obama's 2009 swearing-in, 70 percent smaller than Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration and 60 percent smaller than Obama's second inauguration in 2013. In terms of TV viewership, Trump ranks fifth, far behind Ronald Reagan. Even online estimates don't boost him to biggest audience.
Rioting broke out in D.C. and other parts of the country following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968 in Memphis. (National Archives)
This drew a rebuke from Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a prominent Cuban-American:
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested in a conference call Monday afternoon that the reason Republicans are not moving immediately to replace the health-care law is because they can't. The reason they can't make a proposal is because they don't have the votes, Pelosi argued.
It's a few months, five months at the most. People don't want a short-term job. They don't want -- so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out. All done legally, all done with the process that's...
The majority of the committee rejected arguments made by Republican Reps. Julianne Young and John Green that Idaho voters were uninformed when they passed the initiative in November with 61 percent, Keith reports, adding several state lawmakers also said they couldn't dismiss the large majority of voters who approved the initiative.
Justice Stephen Breyer, in his McCutcheon dissent, warned that the new campaign finance system would be incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy.
We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon, Trump said. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
Trump appeared nonplussed at learning some basic public health information. The precise number of deaths caused by the flu is not known, but the CDC offers estimates that in the past decade range from a low of 12,000 in the 2011-2012 season to a high of 61,000 in the 2017-2018 season (though that is a preliminary estimate).
-- Obamacare enrollment did not dramatically plummet during the latest sign-up period, per new numbers. Amy Goldstein reports: A total of 11.8 million Americans signed up for Affordable Care Act health insurance for 2018, a drop of just 400,000 from the previous year … In an uncharacteristic move, CMS Administrator Seema Verma announced the fifth-year tally in a series of tweets shortly before the report was issued late Tuesday afternoon. The tweets were a blend of praise for what she called 'the most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date' and the Trump administration's characteristic naysaying about the marketplaces that were created by the sprawling 2010 health-care law it has been seeking to dismantle.
The Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles
The situation is a more-pronounced version of what happened to the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). After he voted against the Republican replacement for Obamacare, effectively killing the legislation, his approval dropped among Republicans and rose among Democrats.
Burrell said that his company is committed to the marketplaces and will make every attempt to continue selling the plans. He said that the federal government could take steps to stabilize the marketplaces right away by guaranteeing that the cost-sharing reductions would be paid next year and making a strong statement that people would be penalized if they went without insurance.
RUBIO: They lost their money. Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building. So they gave him his money. They lost their money. Time and again...
Biden has signaled openness to narrowing the range of people who receive stimulus checks, though the White House is still adamant that the size of those checks start at $1,400 per person, rather than the $1,000 proposed by the Republican senators.
Even before the pandemic, the nation's 911 system was strained, William wrote. Across the country, 911 calls are answered by a patchwork of nonprofit, for-profit, hospital-affiliated, fire department and municipal-run services.
— The FDA also announced an effort aimed at making it simpler for pharmaceutical companies to make over-the-counter versions of the opioid antidote naloxone.
Stay out of the Syrian civil war. Although Trump considers Syrian President Bashar al-Assad bad, he has said the United States has higher priorities. Around the world, Trump said, he prefers stability over regime changes. (Trump struck Syria after a chemical weapons attack and hailed the U.S. role in the decline of the Islamic State in the region.)
-- The White House has intentionally ignored document requests from House Democrats as part of their investigations, breaking with the practice of past administrations of both parties and teeing up a constitutional showdown. Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report: The White House has refused to share emails and correspondence in about a dozen document requests from the House Oversight and Reform Committee as well as three additional inquiries from the House Judiciary Committee, which has impeachment jurisdiction. The move is intentional as the White House sees the requests from newly empowered Democrats as illegitimate, too expansive or infringing on presidential privilege, such as Trump's communications with his senior advisers or another head of state, according to two senior administration officials. … Should the White House refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could sue. But litigation could take years, delaying investigations of Trump indefinitely.
California and other Democratic-led states defending Obamacare have appealed the ruling to the US Supreme Court, which has denied a request to fast-track the appeal -- meaning it is possible a Supreme Court decision may not be issued until after the 2020 presidential election, CNN's Dan Berman reports. Wednesday's request for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the case en banc, meaning as a full panel rather than only the three judges, was made by one of the judges on the appeals court, who was not identified in the docket. All eight judges who voted against hearing the case were appointed by Republican presidents. Five of the six who said they would rehear the case were appointed by Democrats, including three by Obama.
It's not being written by us — it's apparently being written by a small handful of staffers or members of the Republican leadership in the Senate, Lee said. So if you're frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration, I share it wholeheartedly.
-- The caravan of immigrants is currently making its way through Mexico, causing that country political headaches and stalling the Central American refugees at a soccer field. Joshua Partlow reports: On Tuesday, several Mexican immigration officials began taking a census at the migrant encampment in the town of Matias Romero, in the southern state of Oaxaca. The migrants crowded around the officials and thrust out their IDs and documents. Several hours later, the officials returned and started calling people's names over megaphones. The authorities handed those individuals temporary legal permits, giving them 20 days to leave Mexico. Several migrants said they would use that time to travel toward the United States. Others could receive 30-day permits to apply for asylum in Mexico.
And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
New coronavirus variants are able to slip passed some of the immunity generated by existing vaccines and prior infections. To keep up with the variants, scientists will need to update vaccines and perhaps prepare for the possibility the coronavirus is here to stay.
Both at the border, and with trade -- and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade. And, he said free trade, I say free trade great. But, not when they're beating us so badly.
The two groups of experts especially differ on the impact on Medicaid enrollment. The Medicare actuary says the impact is almost nil: There is no assumed increase in the number of uninsured related to the repeal of the mandate as that coverage has no premium and little-to-no out-of-pocket costs. The CBO still believes there will be some impact under the theory that the mandate led people to get insurance, only to discover they were eligible for Medicaid.
First, I've obtained some new polling data from the Kaiser Family Foundation that shows large numbers of Trump voters and their families rely on Medicaid, and large numbers of them oppose cutting the program. Click to enlarge:
We need answers; we need clarity very, very soon, Grow said.
-- The D.C. Council voted to reprimand member Jack Evans over allegations that he used his government connections to try to solicit business from law firms that lobby the city. Fenit Nirappil reports: Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) swatted away calls from activists, community groups and five of the council's 13 members to strip Evans of his chairmanship of the finance and revenue committee. … Mendelson proposed to take away some of Evans' responsibilities, shifting oversight of tax abatements, tax increment financing, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority/Events D.C. and Commission on the Arts and Humanities to committees led by other lawmakers. But Evans will retain oversight over other key agencies.
Over time, I think the theme is actually going to be in terms of health-care equity and justice — not just in terms of health-care delivery but cutting across health and housing and the environment and criminal justice, he added.
Ryan: I don't know how you feel, but I'm ready to play some offense. … It's time for us to get back on track, said Ryan.
Rubio's among the group of Republicans generally expected to go along with whatever repeal-and-replace legislation surfaces. Other conservatives, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, are seen as the likely objectors from the right. So his comments are notable, Politico's Jen Haberkorn tweeted:
Again, this is one of those areas where we think individuals ought to have access to the kind of coverage that they want, not the kind of coverage that the government forces them to buy, he said.
A CNN reporter responded to the president's accusation of the network being anti-Trump:
On whistleblowers, Grassley cited a 2018 document from the Trump administration, known as the Granston memo, that he believes offers the executive too many excuses to dismiss cases brought under the False Claims Act, which provides whistleblowers a modicum of legal protection. Barr said he was unfamiliar with the memo, but would review it and discuss it with Grassley if confirmed.
With no explanation or warning, the president now supports an effort to nullify the provisions that make it possible for millions of people to purchase affordable insurance. Thus this new position, directly contradicting his repeated stance as a candidate and as president, qualifies as a flip-flop.
Williamson was eager to jump in, amping up the anti-Trump rhetoric by accusing the administration of state-sponsored child abuse.
This 149-year-old law is why we have government shutdowns
-- House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Trump and his family are the greatest threats to democracy he has seen in his lifetime. The third-ranking Democrat in the House, who was responding to Trump's latest attacks on the late John McCain, went as far as comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler, saying we had better be careful. (NBC)
President Barack Obama delegated aspects of his health-care plan to Hill leaders, but he and his staff kept a tight grip over the proceedings and held numerous events across the country. President George W. Bush led the Republican effort to cut taxes in 2001, while President Bill Clinton's White House spearheaded a sweeping health-care push two decades ago, although it failed to pass.
There is a plan, Conway said on Fox News Sunday. We've been working on a plan for a long time.
Soon after Heller announced his opposition, Katie Walsh, Trump's former deputy chief of staff, confirmed that the super PAC she now advises — America First Policies — is planning a seven figure advertising buy in Nevada targeting Heller. If more GOP senators come out against the bill, they could be targeted in the coming days as well, she said.
-- Washingtonian, Mary Katharine Ham Is Not Here to Entertain You, by Elaina Plott: The right-wing pundit doesn't much care about shock value or tossing red meat to the base—yet somehow she's more popular than ever. How she managed to scale the ranks of Washington media while grieving the death of her liberal-activist husband.
The scorecard is still in development and is a priority for CMS, an agency official told reporter Kimberly Leonard. We have been working with states on its development to ensure it's a collaborative process and isn't a 'federal government knows best' approach to providing greater transparency and accountability of the Medicaid program. The official didn't provide a specific timeline, but the document is expected later this year, Kimberly writes.
Now 24 years later, the grown woman afforded her mother that honor when she introduced her to the crowd, saying: My mother, my hero and our next president.
Peck added that he's pretty skeptical of what the additional exemptions might be, but said he would need to see specifics before weighing in further.
The answer, he said, was incomplete.
Thursday. The House Energy and Commerce Committee holds a hearing to examine the impact of the shutdown on federal workers and public health on
Finally, Cruz should be taking a page from Trump's book and start pounding away at Trump's general election poll numbers. Trump used to say he was the only one beating Clinton (which was not true even then). Now Trump is the only candidate who will never beat Clinton. (Cruz is within the margin of error in most general election poll match-up's against her.) A vote for Trump equals a vote for Hillary Clinton needs to become Cruz's mantra.
WALLACE: Well, I was going to say, I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question. What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?
They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.
Yes, other reasons lay behind the GOP's legislative agenda choices in 2017; but the tendency to chase sunk costs illustrates a more complex story on the role that psychological drivers have in outcomes that we normally ascribe to cold interest-based calculus.
This is the single most important thing I think we can do in the gun control area to stop these massacres from happening in the first place, Barr said under questioning from Feinstein, one of the fiercest advocates of stricter gun laws.
The Families First bill bolsters food programs for children and seniors and suspends the Trump administration's rule requiring more adults to work to be eligible for food stamps. The rule, which would have removed about 700,000 people from the program, was supposed to go into effect April 1 but was blocked by a federal judge. The Agriculture Department is weighing whether to challenge the court decision.
There's a lot of evidence showing Medicaid coverage can improve pregnancy outcomes, said Hannah Katch, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Postpartum health coverage is particularly important because life-threatening conditions after pregnancy are common in the U.S.
Even some of the committee leaders who are crafting the health-care legislation acknowledged after the meeting that plenty remains unresolved.
[From The Fix: Winners and losers from the first night]
Sign into law the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks, the point at which antiabortion activists say a fetus can feel pain. (The Senate did not pass the law, so Trump never signed it.)
Friendships might take Northam only so far. Consider Stanley, perhaps the governor's best pal in the Senate, who has led opposition to Medicaid expansion for the past four years, convinced that the federal government would not keep its promise to pick up 90 percent of the $2 billion-a-year tab. His view has not changed simply because Northam is leading the charge now.
Public health officials are weighing whether to require domestic travelers to show proof of a negative coronavirus test before boarding their flights.
Even the ACA's most devoted supporters have been forced to acknowledge that part of the law was a bust. Four years since the marketplaces opened for business, just four of 23 original co-ops are still operating: Maine Community Health Options, Montana Health Cooperative, Wisconsin's Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative and New Mexico Health Connections.
This is the first time agency officials are providing overall illness and death estimates while flu season is still underway. In the past, these estimates were calculated when the season was over, Lena reports. So far this winter, preliminary figures estimate that influenza infection has sickened between 13 million and 15 million people, sent between 6 million and 7 million people to the doctor, hospitalized 155,00 to 186,000, and killed 9,600 to 15,900.
As recently as November, after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in an election dominated by the health-care issue, Republican congressional leaders had suggested they planned to move on from their years-long efforts to repeal Obamacare.
In a February conference call with donors this year, McCarthy pointed to the May 2017 vote as the moment the majority was basically lost. House conservatives rejected an early version of the repeal bill and negotiated a new plan that removed guaranteed protections for those with preexisting medical conditions and other critical benefits.
But you didn't need his résumé to see Whitaker was in over his head.
Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.
The GOP cites Biden himself for the $160 billion that this figure represents: That's why the American Rescue Plan puts 160 million — billion dollars into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites — everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States has undertaken in peace time, Biden said Feb. 19, while touring a Pfizer vaccine plant.
In private practice, Barr was an occasional pundit who commented publicly — and sometimes skeptically — about Justice Department and Mueller-related matters. He said in 2017, for example, that he would have liked to have seen more balance on Mueller's team — which includes many lawyers who have given political contributions to Democrats — and he wrote that Trump's decision to fire James B. Comey as FBI director was quite understandable.
One Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ted Poe (R-Tex.), announced Sunday that he was resigning from the group out of disgust for how it handled the issue, raising the prospect that the group could crack up after foiling Trump and Ryan on a front-burner item.
Plans are facing various deadlines to set their rates for 2018. But the cost-sharing reduction issue is only the leading edge of a number of uncertainties that could affect how well the markets function. Insurers also want to know if the individual mandate will be enforced and if the administration will do outreach during the open enrollment period to encourage Americans to sign up. The administration did take a step Thursday toward addressing some of insurers' problems with the marketplaces, by finalizing a rule that makes it harder for people to wait until they are sick to sign up for insurance, among other changes.
I received 55 percent of the vote. Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote. And everybody else, none of them made double digits. And that's because you have to have the experience.
Medicare-for-all has also been dominating the nascent 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, serving as an ideological fault line to determine a candidate's liberal bona fides.
I don't know who they could find to replace me, Parkinson said. If they kicked me out, it would be their loss, not mine.
When expansion is presented as a way to work with Trump, Republicans were nearly twice as likely to support it than Democrats. The poll used a computerized voice to pose the questions to 1,000 likely voters, a method generally considered less accurate than surveys conducted by live callers. House leaders have presented the findings to GOP holdouts.
Vice President Pence is preparing a speech slated for next week on Iran policy, one official said, in an attempt to provide a more cohesive explanation of the president's strategy. The flurry of events has led to a sense of confusion in the White House and a lack of clarity around a highly sensitive operation that the administrations of his two predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, had chosen not to take due to risks that it could spark a regional war.
Up to one in seven women experience some form of depression during pregnancy or after childbirth, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, but it's now saying it has found a method to prevent the symptoms from setting in, the New York Times's Pam Belluck reports.
CRUZ: And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on...
None of these realities have stopped Trump from firing off a series of anti-Obamacare tweets over the past week. Invigorated by the Russia investigation's findings, Trump has resumed calls for Congress to repeal Obamacare, pouring pressure on several senators he's asked to lead an effort. He has repeatedly named three Republican senators — John Barrasso of Wyoming, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Rick Scott of Florida — as the leaders on crafting an Obamacare replacement.
Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
There were also complaints that Shulkin misused security services. The inspector general's office determined that he violated ethics rules when he permitted his VA employee driver to use a personal vehicle to drive around his wife, Katie and Lisa write. Generally, the Executive Protection Division exclusively provides security and transportation for the VA secretary and deputy secretary. Family may benefit from those protective services only if they are traveling with the secretary or deputy.
Charles Krauthammer once read a flattering letter from a fan for The Post's Hate Mail segment:
RUBIO: And with that money, he lost more money than he made.
On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.
The agency reported that enrollment was slightly up among those ages 55 and older — making up 29 percent of all enrollees compared to 27 percent last year — and slightly down among those 34 and younger. While 83 percent of consumers nationwide were eligible for subsidies to reduce their monthly premiums, those who weren't eligible chose plans that were 18 percent less expensive on average.

Mercy Virtual has managed to operate in the black partly because of savings from getting patients out of the hospital more quickly and participating in CMS demonstrations. Helton acknowledged the payment challenges, but he said he's optimistic about where things are headed.
Clinics offering young-donor plasma infusions have been popping up, promising the young blood as a rejuvenating anti-aging therapy, but the FDA statement did not cite any specific companies.
We're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them.
Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.
The Georgia Democrat, who narrowly lost a gubernatorial bid last year, suggested earlier in the day that she wouldn't be ready to consider a presidential campaign until 2028. But later, she said on Twitter that a White House bid in the current election cycle was still under consideration.
PC: The player's character — typically a warrior, mage or rogue, though in this case they're Republican politicians and President Trump.
Less than an hour later, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared on television to echo his boss's sentiments, saying his missive hit the bull's eye.
So when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want. No theories. Reality.
Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Ryan and Johnson are in frequent contact about issues that affect Wisconsin and it would be surprising if they didn't talk about Obamacare repeal and replace.
2. Despite his junior status, Jones is playing an outsize role by improving Democrats' bargaining power. His presence allows Democrats to block any Trump nominee, or any legislation, by winning just two Republican defectors, my colleagues write. Senate Republican aides privately conceded that Jones's vote will make it nearly impossible to take another run at repealing the Affordable Care Act, and may quiet talk of a push for major entitlement legislation this year.
Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.
Much work has already been done by conservatives over the past few years to assemble such an agenda.
As McConnell is quick to tell anyone who asks, the Supreme Court isn't the only place he's used Republican-controlled Washington to make lasting conservative changes.
That same strategy could be effective now, say some Democratic advisers, in the face of near-daily attempts by Trump to brand the party as not caring about security.
The Biden administration has made countering domestic extremism a priority.
There is little doubt that the House, which the GOP controls by a 51-to-49 majority, will keep Medicaid expansion in the spending plan, given that Democrats and at least a few Republicans are on board.
TRUMP: These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.
Donald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the nation's 45th president and delivered a fiery nationalist manifesto that promised a populist restoration by stripping power from Washington's elites and ending an era of American carnage.
That's when the signs of partisanship are likely to reappear in places such as West Mifflin, a borough situated along a bend of the Monongahela River that once was populated by union members who worked the region's steel mills. Today it's a bedroom community of modest but tidy homes where Trump came within several dozen votes of beating Clinton, largely because of people such as Rudy and Ruth Antoncic — lifelong Democrats but fervent Trump fans.
And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK. It was not like, Let's bring them in, because I think we should build a safe zone in -- we should really -- what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we're not going to have the problem. That's what we have to do.
Trump redirected billions of dollars to upgrade barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border, made it harder to gain asylum in the U.S. and barred immigration by citizens of 12 countries. Biden calls immigration an irrefutable source of our strength and can tweak policy on his own. But his more ambitious plans would require the approval of Congress, which hasn't passed a major immigration law since 1986.
Klobuchar had a sound-bite moment when she derided Buttigieg for playing the outsider card. Showing real passion, she declared, We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. On health care, she played the truth-teller, saying to Sanders, I keep listening to the same debate on Medicare-for-all, but it's not real. Two-thirds of Senate Democrats aren't on the bill. She continued: It would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years, adding, I will build on the Affordable Care Act — not blow it up.
Then Delaney jumped in, saying de Blasio and Warren want to destroy a system that works well for some people, adding, I think we should be the party that keeps what's working, and fixes what's broken.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who won election last year on a promise to expand the federal-state health-care program, has ordered the General Assembly to return April 11 for a special session. Until then, both sides in the Medicaid fight are trying to pressure legislators while they are back home in their districts, with public meetings, protests and ad campaigns.
As of early March, people have tested positive for the coronavirus in about 70 countries. Officials are taking unprecedented actions. (The Washington Post)
The Affordable Care Act gave 20 million Americans new access to quality health insurance, and guaranteed access to the 135 million more with preexisting conditions who otherwise could have been denied affordable new coverage after losing their jobs. The ACA's Medicaid expansion covers anyone with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line (current income at or below $35,535 for a family of four). The law also provides insurance subsidies through its marketplaces for those with higher incomes — up to 400 percent of the poverty line (up to $103,000 annual income for a family of four) — and the subsidies increase the lower one's income falls.
TRUMP: No, I don't. No, I don't.
If [gross domestic product] falls 15 percent in the second quarter and then rises back 8 percent in the third quarter, he said, economic activity remains at a permanently lower level and does not need the same number of workers. Wishing and hoping it wasn't true. It's a game of musical chairs and there won't be as many seats at the table once we get on the other side of this pandemic.
From The Fact Checker: Were 'no parents' jailed under Kamala Harris' anti-truancy program?
The Phoenix scandal ballooned into a national crisis after VA's inspector general found systemic problems involving delayed medical care for veterans across the country. Then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki eventually stepped down amid a CVA-led campaign demanding his resignation.
This is a ridiculous claim. There were plenty of warnings if Trump has been paying attention. The Chinese government sealed off the city of Wuhan on Jan. 23 to halt the spread of the virus. And on Jan. 28, two former Trump administration officials published an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal titled, Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic. The article identified a number of steps that needed to be taken immediately, such as partnering with the private sector before the CDC was overwhelmed with testing requests — but it took the administration another month to issue the guidance that would encourage private-sector tests.
[Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick] Mahomes . It was more personal than that … He decided to leave because he needed to write his ending. Tom Brady, the one-man dynasty, was Tampa Bay's perfect missing piece , by Jerry Brewer: As Tampa Bay discombobulated Kansas City in a 31-9 victory, the greatest statement wasn't what Brady proved to his former team or anyone else wondering whether he still had it at age 43. It wasn't that he outshined the luminous young. It was more personal than that … He decided to leave because he needed to write his ending.
The other thing I would do that I don't think anyone be interested in: I would raise [those who can stay on their parents' insurance plans from] 26-year-olds to 30 [year-olds]. And the reason I do that is because they don't want to buy insurance. A lot of them are stuck in graduate school or in the gig economy, and their parents would be perfectly willing to cover them and it wouldn't show up on their parents' employer's health insurance because they're healthy.
Unhappiness with DeMint among Heritage board members began shortly after the former senator took over the think tank in 2013, a move that coincided with the departure of some longtime academic researchers. At the same time, DeMint won applause in some quarters for increasing the organization's political clout and outreach to grass-roots conservatives.
To be sure, Trump is a uniquely Republican problem, created by years of GOP coddling of extremists. But I can't help thinking Reid is one who deserves some blame for the deterioration of discourse that numbed the country to Trump's vulgarity.
Watch Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.)'s comments on how Senate Republicans are working behind closed doors on their health-care bill:
Completely repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something terrific that is so much better, so much better, so much better. Americans will have great health care at a fraction of the cost. (The ACA, also known as Obamacare, wasn't repealed.)
An old Moroccan friend; I call him my Sharia Moor. (Chris Doyle)
But that individual mandate was unpopular and Republicans would eliminate that requirement in their proposed American Health Care Act. As a replacement, the AHCA initially included a continuous coverage provision that boosted insurance rates by 30 percent for one year if he or she has a lapse in coverage. (We explored this interaction between the provisions earlier.)
And then, as quickly as it had begun, the feel-good moment was over. A McClatchy reporter asked Reid about his remorse and Reid said with great irritation that he hadn't apologized. He didn't ask for an apology, and he didn't expect an apology, Reid snapped.
I got along with everybody. You get along with nobody, Trump said to Cruz in a February debate. You don't have one Republican senator ... backing you -- not one. You don't have the endorsement of one. (Update: Cruz now has three endorsements in the Senate, although two of those -- Sens. Jim Risch (Idaho) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) -- have announced their backing while holding their noses.)
Sanders, true to form, rejected the entire premise of the question. We need a political revolution, he said, using a favorite tag line.
Opposition softened in the House after Democrats nearly took control of the chamber in a November election wave widely viewed as a rebuke to President Trump.
Friday. The SEC-NYU Dialogue on Securities Markets – Shareholder Engagement will be held in New York on
In a wide-ranging interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said there's no question President Trump is a racist:
And Democrats have vowed to pay close attention to the administrative challenges facing the tax agency. The legislation includes an additional $2 billion in new funding for the IRS to implement the program.
-- Running [Bernie] against Trump would be an act of insanity, New York Magazine liberal columnist Jonathan Chait writes in a piece generating a lot of buzz among Democratic elites. In the months leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, the Democratic Party was the subject of bitter and widespread criticism from its left wing. The party's strategy was to flip the House by recruiting moderate candidates who would avoid controversial left-wing positions and instead focus attention on Trump's agenda, especially his effort to eliminate Obamacare. The left predicted the strategy would fail — only an inspiring progressive agenda could mobilize enough voters to win back the House. … Democrats flipped 40 seats. Tellingly, while progressives managed to nominate several candidates in red districts — Kara Eastman in Nebraska, Richard Ojeda in West Virginia, and many others — any one of whose victory they would have cited as proof that left-wing candidates can win Trump districts, not a single one of them prevailed in November.
I feel that I'm in a position in life where I can provide the leadership necessary to protect the independence and the reputation of the department, Barr said. He added that if he were 45 or 50 years old, the deluge of personnel exiting or otherwise breaking with Trump might give me pause … but it doesn't give me pause right now.
TRUMP: Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
It's also unlikely the change will affect that many Medicaid beneficiaries because such requirements usually have key exemptions for family care, the disabled and those of retirement age. Only about 1 in 10, per Kaiser's numbers, didn't work and didn't qualify for one of these exemptions, Aaron writes. And most of those said they were searching for work, which is another exemption that recipients can generally use — provided it's documented.
Lately, he's been longing for a return of the Obama administration, he told me.
Insisting that an ACA overhaul is still on the table, Mulvaney said the White House will take a similar approach to taxes, by sending principles for health-care reform to Capitol Hill and ask Congress to write the actual legislation.
Take Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). He favors a wealth tax that would start at 1 percent of net worth above $32 million and peak at 8 percent of net worth exceeding $10 billion. (Net worth compares assets, such as stocks and bonds, with liabilities, such as loans.) The Sanders campaign estimates the plan would raise $4.35 trillion over a decade.
Gallup at the time also found more Democrats who approved of him (71 percent) than Republicans (51 percent).
General James Mattis, whose recommendation to be secretary of defense came to the president-elect via current NSA Director-designate Mike Flynn, is an extraordinary, effective leader. To make American safe again, he will deal with our military and strengthen America's alliance with its allies. He will destroy terrorists and he'll face our enemies head-on.
KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
There's another potential benefit to picking Brooks-LaSure: she has previously worked alongside California Attorney Xavier Becerra, who is Biden's nominee for HHS secretary. She served as a staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee while Becerra was a member of that committee.
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.
CMS Administrator Seema Verma framed the invitation for feedback in now-familiar terms, saying that allowing more interstate sales of insurance plans would make them more competitive and affordable. That's been her frequent refrain in announcing various ways for insurers and states to back away from ACA coverage requirements.
After proclaiming I have nothing more to say about the Mueller probe, he went on to answer Republicans' questions about the probe extensively. After Whitaker told Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) that he couldn't say whether the Mueller probe is a witch hunt because it's an ongoing investigation, Johnson asked him why he could talk about the investigation into Roger Stone but not Mueller's investigation.
OOF: Purdue Pharma and the state of Oklahoma have reached a settlement in a major lawsuit over the pharmaceutical company's role in the deadly opioid crisis. It's the first major test of who will pay for more than two decades of death and addiction sparked by prescription opioids, our colleagues Lenny Bernstein and Katie Zezima report.
Sure, it's ridiculous to claim that socialism is best exemplified by Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela (Why not Norway?), but it sure doesn't help when Sanders refuses to condemn Maduro outright.
WALLACE: But you did talk about states doing it.
But try to cram down their throats a hard-edge, anger-driven, now-it's-our-turn policy and they will instinctively reject it.
These comments are blatantly false. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the New York Police Department's Intelligence Division conducted widespread surveillance of Muslim communities and individuals within 100 miles of the city.
Conservatives must be able to address these realities with more than the phrases tax cuts and economic growth. Of course, growth is key. But targeted interventions are also needed. The government should increase workforce participation and further supplement the earnings of low-income working households by expanding the earned-income tax credit for childless adults; make it easier for working-class Americans in sprawling cities to get to work by providing better public transportation options to cut down commute times and make working less onerous; offer assistance to help workers who have tried to get a job in their hometown for a long time without success to move to a stronger job market; cut payroll taxes to better reward work (while also cutting entitlement programs so as not to add to the debt), potentially putting a few thousand dollars per year into the pockets of working- and middle-class households; and expand work-based learning programs like apprenticeships to allow private-sector firms to train workers and to allow the market, not bureaucrats, to decide which skills are needed in the workforce.
The bill had no natural constituency and was widely criticized by conservative health-care experts because it left premium-increasing provisions of Obamacare in place, said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. We now have the opportunity to reset the debate, and conservatives are eager to work with the administration and congressional leadership as things move forward.
Hanger and Wagner did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TRUMP: Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK? And I have said that. So I would like to take that back. He is really not that much of a lightweight. And as far as -- and I have to say this, I have to say this. He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?
With China we're going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades. You just can't do it.
Republicans focused more on economic stimulus, with some favoring aid to affected industries like airlines and hotels. By many reports, Trump considers this a potential electoral crisis for him, and he pushed Congress this week to suspend the payroll tax – thinking that will win him votes come November.
Cassidy didn't respond to an inquiry about the legislation being included in the relief package. He has criticized the relief bill, charging that its many elements — not all of which are connected to the pandemic — reflect the interest of the Democratic constituencies that elected the president.
Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report.
... releasing the New York Times tape. Because, listen, maybe it's right.
Among executives, it certainly hasn't gone unnoticed that Trump's kitchen cabinet of economic advisers includes hedge-fund managers and real estate moguls but no prominent corporate executive. They also resent that, for many Americans, Trump is the model of the successful business executive.
The investigation, conducted by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services and overseen by the Office of Special Counsel, centered on hundreds of millions of dollars intended for the development of vaccines, drugs and therapies by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or BARDA, an arm of the federal health department, they continue.
But if Trump offers to pardon a family member — or himself? There, Barr guessed, the political consequences might be more severe than the legal ones.
News stations rarely used banners in their coverage 20 years ago, though the technology was widely available at the time. The TV landscape was a less competitive place — the Internet was still in its infancy as a news source, smartphones and streaming had yet to be introduced, and cable systems provided only a few dozen channels.
Unfortunately for them — though not unexpectedly, in this part of New Hampshire — snow began falling overnight. A planned visit by Yang to a diner in Berlin was abruptly canceled, and not everyone who had signed up for it got the memo. Fred the Felon arrived early and began playing the role of an unofficial surrogate, telling diners how he had learned of Yang and why he had the answers.
OOF: With a partial ban on flavored e-cigarettes taking effect today, the heads of major e-cigarette makers weren't excited about facing lawmakers' scrutiny in yesterday's hearing on youth vaping.

This was a big abuse 27 years ago, and it's gotten worse, Barr said. And so we need to change the laws and stop that kind of abuse.
-- Democratic leaders in the House are also pressing for more information on two previously undisclosed trips Flynn made to the Middle East in 2015. Karoun Demirjian reports: According to the ranking Democrats on the House Oversight and House Foreign Affairs committees — Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), respectively — Flynn's security forms and interviews revealed a previously unreported, six-day trip he made to Saudi Arabia in October 2015, in which he claimed to have stayed at a hotel that does not appear to exist, have traveled with a friend who was never named, and have spoken at a conference that none of his handling bureaus were aware of. According to congressional testimony Flynn gave in June 2015, Flynn also made an earlier trip that involved talks about developing nuclear power in the region. But Flynn never documented the trip on his security clearance forms at all.
BAIER: ... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya, not Syria.
Some international experts have called on wealthy countries to share vaccine doses to help protect those most at risk around the world, even before fully vaccinating at home. But it's an idea that appears to have gained little currency. Canada alone has acquired deals for 338 million doses — enough to vaccinate its population five times over and more than the World Health Organization-backed program Covax plans to distribute to poorer countries in the entire first half of the year.
Meanwhile, disapproval of the GOP bill has ticked up two points, for a total net swing against the bill of eight points. What's more, the new Morning Consult poll shows that only 1 in 5 voters thinks it will decrease their health-care costs, while a plurality of 39 percent think they will increase. And note this:
And if Owens believes the Democratic platform works to the detriment of black America, she should make that case, issue by issue. She will find more agreement out there than you might suspect. But the implication that the vast majority of black voters are bound to a Democratic Party plantation is a misunderstanding of Politics 101 and an insult to an entire slice of the electorate.
-- Bolton has become a target of the pro-Trump Internet. Isaac Stanley-Becker dissects the anatomy of a smear: The vilification of Bolton — branding him as a traitor and member of the 'deep state'… — made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when [Rand Paul] described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president's impeachment trial as a 'disgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.'
Democrats don't shy away from guns: A topic many Democrats steered clear of for decades was front and center in the second hour of the debate, highlighting how attitudes have changed in recent years amid rising anger in the party over mass shootings.
From the shadows to the spotlight: Melania Trump belatedly steps into her role as first lady
It becomes very difficult for Republicans to go a different course, although I would hope that we would, Sanford said Tuesday before Trump spoke. On Wednesday, he, like other conservatives, split hairs: He didn't say 'refundable'; he said 'tax credits.' 
Nineteen states had already increased to 21 the age requirement to buy tobacco products when the federal law passed. Raising the federal age limit was intended to force the remaining 31 states to follow suit, Alex writes. However, public health advocates say the Food and Drug Administration hasn't made clear how state and local authorities that enforce tobacco-age laws are supposed to react. One advocate said many were caught off guard when the FDA simply announced with a notice on its website that the new law is in effect.
Democrats have long advocated increasing these subsidies as a way of improving on the ACA, but they've been unable to garner GOP support.
It's rush hour on a November evening in Washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. The Federalist Society has taken over the Main Hall of Union Station for its annual black-tie gala. The stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of James Madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. Two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.
Some Republicans predict privately that McConnell has a better chance of winning over Murkowski than Collins. Murkowski has traditionally been more aligned with leadership's interests in her 14 years in the Senate. Her father was a senator, and in her early years in the chamber, McConnell helped advance her into a junior leadership post. Having just won her own reelection last year, Murkowski has more political freedom to maneuver than Collins, who has flirted with running for governor next year.
But, overall, Republicans have been largely obsequious to Trump, especially when it comes to the Russia investigation. Last year, McConnell refused to bring up a bill to protect Mueller from being fired, even as some of the majority leader's Republican colleagues supported it. This year, Republicans confirmed Barr to the all-important attorney general position at the Justice Department over Democratic concerns that he wouldn't be an impartial judge of the facts. Now Republicans are taking Barr's word that Trump didn't obstruct justice, even though legal experts question the attorney general's rationale.
In some parts of the Sanders orbit, there have been private discussions about how to reassure Democrats, Sean Sullivan and Bob Costa report. Some close Sanders allies believe the distance between the Sanders movement and the party have caused broader issues, especially when Biden is portraying himself as a unifier. … As Sanders spoke in Vermont on Wednesday afternoon, a handful of his prominent supporters quietly connected by phone and text message … In these discussions, some debated whether Sanders's anti-establishment message was enough. 'We've got to be ready for when the party gets cold feet on Biden and looks to us,' one of the Democrats said. 'We can't just keep running the same playbook again and again.' A second … added that there are some leading liberals in Sanders's orbit who would like to see 'less Michael Moore and the Squad' on the campaign trail.
The Jan. 23 special -- to be streamed from an auditorium in the Capitol Visitor Center -- will use the networks' streaming services to show Sanders taking audience and online questions about how single-payer health care could be implemented in the United States.
The latest discussions about Medicare mark a new chapter in the partisan debate. Many Democrats are eager to continue putting health care at the forefront of the national conversation. Democratic presidential candidates should be raising this issue morning, noon and night, said Blumenthal, who co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all proposal in the last Congress.
Lawmakers, interest groups and journalists prepared for the release of the Senate's health-care bill. Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on an as-yet-unseen bill next week, but Democrats are doing what they can to slow things down:
Citizen bloggers, dissidents and gadflies who post criticism or negative news of the government are being spared tough punishment that authorities might have otherwise meted out in ordinary times, Gerry writes. Meanwhile, the country's dwindling ranks of independent-minded journalists are also enjoying an unusual level of freedom to aggressively report in the outbreak's epicenter — at least for now.
He was hung upside down with his hands and feet bound,
Republicans strove to highlight association health plans in a contentious Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday. Ways and Means Democrats spent their time bashing GOP lawmakers for trying so long and hard to knock down the ACA and its protections for people with preexisting conditions.
TRUMP: But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
Books could be — and have been — written on why drug costs are so high in the United States. The prescription drug industry is perhaps the most complicated ecosystem I've tried to understand, driven by all sorts of pricing pressures along the supply pipeline. But it's possible to boil down a few key differences between the United States and other developed countries who are able to offer cheaper medicines to their citizens.
Investigators found that staff referred to the agency as the bank of BARDA and told investigators that research and development funds were tapped for other projects. The inspector general flagged that BARDA spent $897,491 between fiscal 2013 and 2017 for salaries of staffers who did not work at the agency and improperly covered millions in administrative costs, such as having furniture removed from other parts of the building in which the office was housed.
Obama himself left little doubt as to which way he'd answer that CBS poll question during a speech in November in which he urged Democrats running for the White House not to lurch too far left to win the nomination. This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement, the former president said during a meeting of the Democracy Alliance, the powerful network of liberal megadonors, in what was covered at the time as a subtle rebuke of Sandersism. They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.
McCaul: There should be consequences anytime [there is] a gruesome act of murder against a journalist, political dissident. We need to stand up for what we believe in as Americans. And I think there should be consequences.
The voter files found by Vickery could easily be abused if placed in the wrong hands, he said: With this data you can target neighborhoods, individuals, people of all sorts of persuasions.… I could give you the home address of every person the RNC believes voted for Trump.
If Obama's comments on the Supreme Court violated norms, though, Trump's have obliterated them.
—Even a Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she was very disappointed in the administration's legal position. It is highly unusual for the Department of Justice not to defend duly enacted laws, which the Affordable Care Act certainly was, Collins said. This decision to even go more broadly in failing to defend the law is very disappointing.
They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right?
These constraints and inconveniences drive many low-income Americans to payday lenders and check cashers, with their high interest rates and fees. But if these individuals could be paid in a digital currency like USD Coin — a version of bitcoin whose value is pegged to the dollar — people could receive and spend small amounts of money without high bank fees. And, unlike in conventional savings or checking accounts, holders of even small amounts of digital currencies can now collect interest on their holdings, at rates exceeding 5 percent.
The leader of the Republican Party took some tentative steps in his address to the joint congressional session toward a position in the Obamacare fight looming over Capitol Hill. But the president's words sparked as much debate as they quashed.
The Business Roundtable, representing chief executives of the largest public companies, received similar pressure from the Republican leadership.
Insulin is a particularly striking case study as lawmakers go after the problem of impossibly expensive prescription drugs in the United States. For one thing, a huge number of Americans live with diabetes; of the 30 million Americans with the illness, 7.4 million rely on insulin.
Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) said any attack on the ACA, through legislation or the courts, was the single most unifying issue for House Democrats — from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the liberal star of the freshman class, to Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.), the 29-year veteran centrist from a rural district Trump won by more than 30 percentage points.
I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all of the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.
Buttigieg was criticized by Hickenlooper, who said that — as mayor of Denver — he had taken steps to improve relationships between residents and police. He was also criticized by Swalwell, who asked why he had not taken firmer action.
The breakdown in business bipartisanship begins with DeLay, said Jerry Jasinowski, who back then was president of the National Association of Manufacturers. I can remember people being called on the carpet just for having meetings with Democrats.
So, on the Metro front I would -- again, I would ask you to go to WMATA and see if they're ready to -- what they're plans have been. But I think that the president has been a -- just overwhelmed by the amount of support and outpouring of people that want to participate in some way with this historic inauguration.
I am pleased this important provision will remain in the critical relief bill before the Senate this week, Wyden said. Workers who have been laid off need affordable health care for their families now more than ever, and helping people pay their COBRA premiums will make that a reality for millions.
TRUMP: ... Marco you don't know (INAUDIBLE)...
Here's the way these guys look at it, said one government official turned executive. Should I go to Washington and waste my time or go to China and talk to people who can actually do something?
Once the committees approve their versions of repeal — something aides expect may happen in February or March — the House would vote on the entire repeal package before sending it to the Senate, where the chamber's parliamentarian will pick through the legislation with a fine-toothed comb. The parliamentarian has the authority to throw out any elements that violate budget rules before the bill comes up for another vote in the Senate. If the parliamentarian rules against Republicans, it is at this point that Democrats would probably have their best chance to defeat the measure or otherwise alter it. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) has pledged to block all replacement efforts.
One senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the White House thinks it has tremendous authority to write executive orders under food, drug and cosmetics laws, as well as through the Affordable Care Act, which gives the government broad power to test ways to improve health care and reduce costs in government programs.
NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:
Pelosi, eager to protect her newfound majority and looking ahead to the 2020 elections, has made it a point to put distance between her party and the policies espoused by some of her new, liberal members, including both women. Republicans have tried to use the liberal policy initiatives against all Democrats. Pelosi purposely has cast the proposals as aspirational, telling The Washington Post she was agnostic about Medicare-for-all compared with the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and calling Ocasio-Cortez's environmental Green New Deal the green dream.
Sometimes people's applications and enrollments are more complicated and need somebody to process them, said Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. If that somebody is at home not doing any work, then it becomes a problem.
It was an unvarnished declaration of the basic principles of his populist, and kind of nationalist, movement, Bannon said. I don't think we've had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House. But you could see it was very Jacksonian. It's got a deep, deep root of patriotism there.
— The Virginia House and Senate have approved legislation to undo GOP-backed abortion restrictions.
-- On the financial front, a bipartisan group of senators signed a letter asking the State and Treasury Departments to review a possible Russian takeover of the petroleum company Citgo. The Hill's Sylvan Lane reports: Citgo, owned by the government of Venezuela, risks defaulting on a loan from Rosneft, a Russian state-owned energy company. Rosneft could take control of Citgo upon default, giving a company with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin command of United States infrastructure … 'Citgo operates across 19 states, with 48 terminals, interstate oil and gas pipelines, and refineries,' the senators wrote. 'Serious questions have been raised regarding the national security risk of Rosneft — a company with close ties to President Putin — assuming control of U.S. energy infrastructure.'
Exactly — and as I've argued, it is facts and reality, ferreted out by a dogged and determined press, that pose a major threat to Bannon's grand designs, and he knows it.
Robert Aaron Long , a resident of [Cherokee County], was taken into custody south of Atlanta in Crisp County. Atlanta police said that based on video evidence, Long is the likely suspect in the shootings at all three massage parlors, although they are still working to confirm the connection. 
There would be ripple effects throughout the health-care industry and insurance landscape as well. Those with workplace plans could be affected, as employers would be allowed to scale back certain medical benefits, and people with preexisting conditions buying coverage on their own would no longer be guaranteed access to coverage at no extra cost.
And Sanofi's Lantus, a long-acting insulin used to keep blood sugars stable throughout the day, became 77 percent more expensive between 2013 and 2019.
-- Many experts fear Trump's desire for a deal to distract from Michael Cohen's congressional testimony this week at home could lead him to make too many concessions to Kim. The AP's Foster Klug reports: Kim could agree to give up only part of his arsenal — his intercontinental missiles aimed at America, for instance, or his main nuclear reactor — in return for an easing of harsh sanctions. There's also fear that Trump will eventually orchestrate some sort of drawdown of U.S. troops from South Korea or an extended halt to U.S.-South Korean military drills. … [Kim] would be taking a huge step toward cementing the North as a nuclear weapons state and, as a bonus, driving a wedge in the U.S.-South Korea alliance that the North maintains is aimed at the overthrow of the Kim family — all without addressing the North's arsenal of short- and mid-range nuclear armed missiles aimed at Seoul, Tokyo and other parts of Asia.
Gillibrand stood out toward the end of the exchange by suggesting several concrete changes, saying the country needs immigration centers that are community-based. And, she added, border security needs more funding.
Let's zoom out for a moment. There's broad consensus that combining counseling services with medication-assisted treatment is the best way to help people who are addicted to prescription painkillers, heroin or the synthetic opioid fentanyl.
But Bloomberg's company also has significant financial interests in China. He was criticized for saying during a September television interview, amid the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and China's ongoing repression of Muslim minorities, that President Xi Jinping is not a dictator. Xi, he explained, has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.
There are also opportunities to work as a freelancer or independent contractor. Uber is trying to recruit drivers to its Eats food delivery platform. With folks cloistered at home, there could be some money in delivering for other platforms such as Grubhub or DoorDash.
She has no right to decry criticism . . . even criticism that is in language that offends her fragile sensibilities, Fair wrote in a Facebook post.  'F–k off' and 'go to hell' and 'pimping yourself out' for media coverage offended her . . . but not 'I can grab their p—–s' or the various misogynist, racist, xeonophobic [sic] race-baiting bulls–t espoused by her candidate of choice.
RUBIO: ... To get them to give you their money...
Like members of Congress, voters too say they hate shutdowns, polls show. But by Election Day, in successive contests, they have demonstrated that they don't really care.
Democrats have sought to take advantage of the crisis as well, with some arguing in favor of long-sought policies ranging from eliminating student loan debt to universal basic income to nationwide vote-by-mail.
Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here. And I appreciate the discussion back and forth. But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who's going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America. And let's stop fighting.
I found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the Mayflower Hotel that bookended the gala. The judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting Supreme Court justices in their 80s — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. Numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. I counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by Trump — and at least 11 of the names on Trump's expanded list of potential Supreme Court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.
Other cataclysms of the past century – such as wars and the 1918 flu pandemic – levied heavy tolls among the young. Not so for covid-19.
My goal and intent, he insisted, is to get as much information out as I can.
Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous, Roberts said.
For his part, Primus told Ryan he did not discuss a specific deal with insurers during the December meeting. And Pelosi spokesperson Henry Connelly described the presentation as a a broad look at the health care environment and some of House Democrats' legislative priorities over the next two years in a period of GOP control of the Senate and White House. We're not going to barter lower prescription drug costs for inaction in the rest of the health care industry, Connelly said.

Health 202: Tell me how you feel about Medicare-for-all.
House Democrats would be wise to pass the bill, send it to the Senate and then hold Republicans accountable if they refuse to vote on it and the court strikes down the ACA. Meanwhile, presidential candidates should reassure voters that they can deliver real, meaningful relief that is also feasible — and much preferable to a bumper-sticker slogan with no chance of passing Congress.
TYT, which has hosted Democrats including Joe Manchin and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has nearly 4.3 million YouTube subscribers and a committed audience that sees its hosts as more credible than cable news reporters.
Almost everyone developed symptoms quickly after receiving the shot, which is why the CDC recommends patients wait 15 minutes at the vaccination site after the injection, or 30 minutes for those with a history of severe allergic reactions. Still, some public-health experts worry initial reports about allergic reactions will dissuade people from getting the shot.
The bottom line of Klein's argument is that polarization was driven fundamentally by race. The Republican Party has become the home of angry white voters anxious that the United States is turning into a majority minority society, as California already has, a reality epitomized by the election of Barack Obama.
Another notable downside: The vaccine hasn't shown any measurable protection for older adults, Lena writes. There was only an 8 percent reduction in the need to go to the doctor for the flu.
-- Mike Bloomberg may be lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, but he's attracted the president's obsessive attention by baiting him with constant attack ads. Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer report: The president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him 'Mini Mike' to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials. 'It's very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide … Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. … Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on 'Fox & Friends' on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as 'dopes and babies.' Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.
Barr gave yet another reckoning of his pivotal Mueller memo at the invitation of Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), during which he stressed that expanding the obstruction of justice laws could essentially paralyze the government.
The president has visibly gained weight in recent years, Anne adds. It's no secret Trump prefers red meat, fast food and sweets, and other than golf, Trump is not known to exercise, she notes. Trump does not smoke or drink.
Some Democrats mourned the loss but said it means they need to dig in deeper against the GOP health-care effort:
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on managing pain during the opioid crisis on Tuesday.
on May 15. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on Examining Oversight Reports on the 340B Drug Pricing Program
All of this argues for increased surveillance of the virus as it spreads through the population and collides with natural and vaccine-induced immunity, Joel and Ben write. But [t]he United States has been slow to develop the kind of genomic sequencing that has enabled Britain to closely monitor mutations in the virus and the spread of different variants.
It's unclear when CMS might finalize the additional guidance. People within the agency said it was putting several items on hold until the confirmation of Alex Azar as HHS secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate Wednesday is a 55 to 43 vote.
— Three Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee called on federal officials to brief Congress on the status of the Ebola outbreak in Congo.
Thus, four things would need to happen before someone would be affected: You live in a state that seeks these waivers; have a lapse in health coverage for longer than 63 days; have a preexisting condition; and buy insurance on the individual market.
But: Republicans are also rushing to pass health care now because they're running up against a legislative deadline. For Senate Republicans to avoid a Democratic filibuster, they have to pass this bill while they're debating the budget. (I've got an explainer on the reconciliation process here.)
Barr, under questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), said he had no specific information about Uranium One that suggested wrongdoing and that he didn't necessarily believe the Clinton Foundation should come under a criminal investigation.
I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. (Trump criticized then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who was injured while riding a bicycle amid the Iran negotiations.) (Trump lived up to this, by all accounts.)
The treatments, which involve plasma infusions from young donors, are being marketed as a treatment or cure for conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. But federal health regulators say there's no proof the treatments work, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
The new order, which Johnson & Johnson indicated has not been finalized, will bring total United States orders of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to 200 million. Because it's a one-dose vaccine, the supply will represent enough for 200 million people, they add. It is not expected to be fulfilled until the second half of the year, administration officials said.
There were a lot of things that were promised to be done, and we're just getting a lot of noise out of Washington, said Marc Rotterman, a longtime Republican consultant in North Carolina who was a Trump supporter ahead of last year's election. It seems it's Russia 24-7. When you're reacting and defending, you're not moving on your agenda. You're not fixing day-to-day problems for average Americans.
• Forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt per American. This appears to be something Biden could do on his own, though it would be expensive -- $390 billion, by one measure.
Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.
You can still be problematic even if asymptomatic,
So far, the curiosity factor has helped Yang, and he has embraced it, with a couple of caveats. He was amused by some of the memes that were generated after posters on 4Chan and other strange corners of the Internet decided that it would be funny to support him. He was disturbed when white nationalists began tweeting enthusiastically about him. Other outsider candidates had wrestled with what to do when fringe groups and racists wanted to help out, and no one had really figured out how to fumigate the room.
Everybody agrees that the ACA is better than nothing, Hill said. You better believe not a single one of us is going to let that get overturned.
In the case of the initial estimate, the GOP leadership shot itself in the foot by insisting that the CBO (which takes its orders from Congress) rely on a baseline from March 2016, rather than a more recent January 2017 baseline. That's because the GOP-led Congress in January was in such a rush to repeal Obamacare that it moved forward before the CBO could complete an updated baseline, as it does regularly during the year.
We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be — they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.
Meanwhile, one building over and outside of Jeff Sessions's hearing, Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who campaigned for Hillary Clinton and became the target of a Trump rampage on Twitter, quietly browsed his phone. I have no illusion that this nominee will not be confirmed, he said to a reporter. But we are going to continue to hold him accountable. It was very heartening to hear this nominee say that he does not stand for a Muslim ban, and I hope that was genuine and it wasn't for the expediency of getting confirmed.
Since those initiatives appear dead in Congress — at least for now — Haltmeyer and Handelman said they're hopeful states will step in and create their own reinsurance pools. So far, Alaska, Oregon and Minnesota have obtained permission from the federal government to pay for the highest-cost customers with reinsurance pools, and another three states — Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Maryland — have passed similar legislation.
More than 100 patient and community organizations wrote to Verma last year that they are very concerned that the proposed changes to how the state can select their essential health benefits will diminish patient care and increase beneficiary's out of pocket costs.
Will I get my job back when this is over?
Diaper banks can't keep up with skyrocketing demand.
From antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List:
Since gaining control of Congress and the White House in January, Republicans have been on a frantic and futile search for the political and economic free lunch. It would be overly charitable to say that, when it comes to governance, they are rusty and out of practice. In fact, they have now exposed themselves to be rank amateurs and incompetents who don't have a clue about getting important things done.
Nonetheless, tensions remained evident. Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) rose in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Thursday night to lambaste Meadows and the Freedom Caucus, only to be talked down by colleagues wary of sparking an intraparty shouting match.
But Northam developed a staunch record on Democratic issues, especially health care. He led efforts to pass a smoking ban in Virginia restaurants and skewered Republican efforts to require women to get a transvaginal ultrasound before obtaining an abortion.
Senate Democrats are facing increasing pressure to end or modify the filibuster from their more liberal members, the more progressive wing of the House and outside activist groups. As all 50 Republicans lined up against Biden's $1.9 trillion covid relief plan, some more moderate Democrats, including Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, signed on to the idea. But in order to alter the rules, all 50 Democrats in the chamber would have to vote in favor, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the resulting tie. At least two centrist Democrats -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- have said they won't go along. Manchin says the filibuster should be made more painful to use by requiring senators who invoke it to speak continuously.
I'll tell you something that will totally revise your belief that addicts don't want to be addicted. It is factually untrue. They get themselves addicted over and over again, Sackler said in another email exchange included in the lawsuit.
Despite several raucous town halls across the country with House members on recess, the health-care debate quickly receded from view with news of Trump firing James B. Comey as FBI director.
-- Inslee's decision to go all in on climate is certainly calculated, but it's not craven. This is not some election-year conversion. Back in 2007, Inslee co-authored a 416-page book on this topic called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy. Bill Clinton wrote the foreword.
This is the first major test of whether popular mobilization and institutions such as the news media and the courts can mount a serious check on Trumpism's worst impulses. Though these struggles are going to be long, intense, brutally difficult, and at times very dispiriting — with, let's face it, an uncertain overall outcome — this is a somewhat reassuring start.
Romney endorses Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).
The president's latest morning tweetstorm further reduces the odds that the House will pass a carefully negotiated bill next week, which would protect dreamers from deportation, authorize money for a border wall and avert family separation. The legislation designed to garner GOP consensus was poised to go down in flames if it came up today, so House GOP leaders announced last night that they are postponing consideration until next week so that they can make further adjustments. Another bill that more closely matched Trump's immigration priorities failed Thursday on the House floor, 231 to 193.
Second, it is good to keep Biden in fighting form, continuing to boost turnout and showing, as he did in Philadelphia, how presidential he is. Biden can pivot to the general election, essentially ignoring Sanders. (His planned speech on the coronavirus is the perfect opportunity to leave Sanders out of the discussion entirely.)
McConnell was also unapologetic about a clash on the Senate floor between him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as attorney general. McConnell used a Senate rule to effectively silence Warren after she criticized Sessions, then a member of the Senate.

With a not-so-subtle jab at the Obamacare website rollout, Trump boasted that the website he tasked Google with developing will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. He falsely claimed that Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now and adding that they've made tremendous progress.
Bloomberg called to discuss the economic plan that he will roll out today at a community college in the South Side of Chicago, on a soybean farm in rural Minnesota and at a converted tire factory in Akron, Ohio.
During his three terms on Capitol Hill, from 2011 to 2017, he represented a swath of central New York from the Pennsylvania border to Lake Ontario and was among the 25 richest members of Congress.
On immigration, if you don't like amnesty, if you don't like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.
A group that promotes safety-net health plans:
Michelle Obama, who stressed the importance of physical fitness as first lady, shared a bit about her workout routine:
(UNKNOWN): Our question was about Afghanistan. That day on October...
Yet moments later, the president seemed to acknowledge the widespread reports of turbulence and upheaval emanating out of his West Wing, only to claim that his White House — which so far has been marred by staff infighting, a controversial travel ban, false statements and myriad leaks — was operating seamlessly.
White House spokesman Judd Deere added that Democrats are pushing radical plans that would take health care away from millions of Americans.
Democrats will deride his boasts about protecting preexisting conditions and repealing the ACA's penalty for lacking coverage. But Trump's remarks about high drug prices are in a middle category: It's an issue where there's room for bipartisan agreement but also partisan disputes over how far the government should go in regulating the pharmaceutical industry.
'I come from the Ronald Reagan school of politics,' Hogan told Bob and Erin in a wide-ranging interview at the state capitol, shaking his head in disapproval when asked if he shares Trump's nationalism.
The international trade organization is considering a proposal from India and South Africa that would temporarily waive patent rights to facilitate technology transfer and speed up production of the vaccines, Reuters's John Miller reports.
6. The guy who has a little too much fun on audience get acquainted night
OUCH: Health officials have for the fourth week in a row added dozens of new cases of measles to the growing list of confirmed cases this year, bringing the current total to 626, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. The United States is now set to surpass the record number of measles cases in a single year since 2000, when the disease was declared eliminated.
But now that they're in the House majority, Democrats have a choice to make: Will they make good on their idealistic campaign trail promises or scale back their goals, given the unlikelihood they will be fully achieved with a GOP-controlled Senate and President Trump in the White House?
Our findings are part of a growing body of experimental work that focuses on politically critical judgment errors by elites. These include work such as Dan Butler and Adam Dynes's 2016 study of American state and local politicians; they find that representatives systematically discount the opinions of constituents with whom they disagree, even though they should be strongly motivated to avoid such bias, as those citizens will have a say in the politicians' performance review at the polls.
SPEAKER: My son Ronald da Silva (ph) was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what so -- makes me so outrageous is that we came here legally.
IRS spokeswoman Jodie Reynolds said: The IRS delivered this unprecedented effort in record time, delivering the first round of payments less than three weeks after the law was signed. For comparison, the stimulus payments delivered in 2008 took 75 days to begin to reach taxpayers.
Of all his work in Congress, he said, he was proudest of having helped marshal bipartisan support in 2012 to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Some Republicans sought to amend the anti-domestic-violence bill by excluding protections for gay and transgender people, Native Americans, and battered women who were in the United States illegally.
Azar has only been secretary for five days, so it's still not clear how he'll reshape HHS. But even some Democrats – six of whom voted to confirm him in the Senate – believe he will have a positive impact.
--The dream of repealing the ACA is over for Republicans, even the most conservative lawmakers are admitting. There was no mention of repealing or replacing the health-care bill at the GOP retreat in West Virginia this week, Politico's Burgess Everett reports. Senate Republicans would struggle to pass a bill slashing at Obamacare under the best circumstances this year, he writes. They lost a Senate seat in Alabama in December and are down another vote as Sen. John McCain undergoes cancer treatment. GOP leaders would rather put the debacle of last year's failed attempt behind them.
You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices. But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs. Sir, that's the facts. You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...
The outcome that day only hardened divisions and raised the stakes, according to committee member Bethany Hallam, who also serves on the Allegheny County Council.
Several Republican senators up for reelection this November and facing tough campaigns — including Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) — indicated during the meeting that they were ready to vote against witnesses and proceed to the final vote … The defense rested at 2:54 p.m. But a few senators lingered [in the chamber], and those huddles showed the tension still left in the room. In chairs in the back, reserved for staffers, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) sat with freshman Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), a moderate not prone to listening to leadership. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), a Democrat always in the mix, first huddled with moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) before moving on to a long one-on-one discussion with Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another key moderate who had previously been talking with Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). And, finally, Collins walked over to join a Republican scrum led by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), whose back-row desk has long been seen as a pivotal place, given his Bush-era political lineage.
Of course, Ryan is leaving in a few months, so his lame-duck struggles won't last forever.
Williamson had perhaps the most surprising answer, saying she'd place a call to the leader of New Zealand, who has bragged that her country is the best place for children to grow up. I would say, 'Girlfriend, you are so wrong because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up,'  Williamson said.
On PEPFAR, it would provide $3.35 billion for bilateral efforts at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, about 30 percent below fiscal 2019 levels. On the Global Fund, the budget proposes $958.4 million, which is 29 percent below the fiscal 2019 level.
I'm not sure what you're talking about, Barr said, later asking, What would be stomach-turning about that?
The students announced a national symposium to be held at Yale in the spring of 1982. Word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that Otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. Daniel Kelly was a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. Thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from Worcester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's Yale dorm. They were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, Kelly recalls, which is when you look at the Constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. Kelly is now head of the Federalist Society lawyers chapter in Boston, where, in late October, Sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.
on May 15. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on Examining Oversight Reports on the 340B Drug Pricing Program
The Collins campaign dismissed the endorsement, saying Planned Parenthood has become more partisan. Senator Collins has not changed, but leadership at Planned Parenthood certainly has, Collins campaign spokesman Kevin Kelley told David. It's sad that the group is now run by far-left activists who would rather focus on partisan politics than bipartisan policies that provide health care to women.
• Trump says he watched (nonexistent) video of Iran receiving cash (MSNBC, August 2016).
The hang-ups: The debate over warrantless surveillance isn't new, and it doesn't fall along party lines. Those who think the program opens the door for abuse of government power include libertarian-minded Republicans such as Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), as well as liberal Democrats.
Eventually we probably get to something like 'Medicare-for-all,'  he said, but we start by expanding it and helping people now. It will make a huge difference.
Create a database of Syrian refugees. Trump has also seemed open to the idea of creating a database of Muslims in the country, although his aides say that is not true.

Prospects for the group to achieve any results — or even get off the ground — are uncertain, Erica Werner, Sean Sullivan and Damien Paletta wrote. But the group's creation is a sign senators of both parties are eager to end the shutdown, even if it means taking matters into their own hands amid an impasse between top Democrats and President Trump.
Between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused me to lose the popular vote.
-- Some Trump administration officials have pointed to the fruitful U.S.-Vietnamese relationship as a possible example for North Korea to follow in transforming itself from foe to friend. But historians say that may not be realistic. Simon Denyer reports: While it is clear that Kim would like to establish some carefully walled-off tourism and economic development zones, and learn from Vietnam's experience in that regard, there is a vast difference between that and truly reforming the country's economy. … Indeed, North Korea's tolerance of private traders and markets has been matched by reports of a renewed crackdown on foreign cultural influences, such as videos of South Korean dramas and movies. … Vietnam's economic transformation has been enabled by granting its people significant freedoms — to travel, to trade, to communicate with and learn from foreigners — just as China's success came by unleashing its people's entrepreneurial ability.
And that isn't all. The Environmental Protection Agency has taken the opportunity to announce that, for as long as the coronavirus crisis lasts, they won't be bothering to enforce environmental laws if the polluters claim that their pollution had something to do with the pandemic. You had to dump those chemicals in the river because you didn't have enough staff to process them? Okey dokey.
At a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on March 28, for instance, Trump made 64 claims that ended up in the database. Many have been previously covered in our fact checks, but here are some fresh statements that are worthy of attention.
Republican disagreements over immigration — including DACA, quotas, family reunification and humanitarian protections — helped Democrats press for action. Republicans apparently discounted Democrats' threats to prolong the stalemate. But Democrats' efforts to forge common ground with more collaborative Republicans could make it harder for McConnell to ignore bipartisan demands.
In Mt. Lebanon, Dave Banyan, 65, said that he had made up his mind on the race as soon as President Trump was President Trump. He said he did not want Democrats to get one vote closer to controlling the House of Representatives.
Friday. The Alliance or Health Policy holds an event on state opportunities to address prescription drug costs in Medicaid on
The Trump administration has several drug pricing efforts in the works, mostly centered on tweaking the way the government pays for drugs in the Medicare program. But it's been bold enough to have won some respect — if begrudging — from some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress, including Welch.
A look back at previous shutdowns suggests that there could be a clear immediate political reaction, but that those effects are likely to fade over time, as Harry Enten wrote on Jan. 20 for FiveThirtyEight. Prior shutdowns haven't had long-term electoral implications, he wrote, noting that in the congressional election of 1996, just a month after the end of that year's shutdown, Republicans held their majorities in both the House and Senate.
October is coming up sooner than we realize, especially when you consider that Congress is taking all of August off. So if Republicans don't pass health-care reform in the next few weeks, they'll likely have to choose: tax reform or health care.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, the liberal Vermont independent who used to lead the Senate Veterans' Affairs panel, is dead set against turning over more VA medical care to the private sector and warned he'd oppose Jackson's nomination if he doesn't come out against privatization.
KELLY: I'm going to let you respond to that, Mr. Trump. I'm going to then go to you, Governor. You're up next.
Let's take a case study. Lawrence Summers, one of the best-known Democratic economists — he held senior posts in the last two Democratic administrations — wrote an op-ed for The Post arguing that the $1.9 trillion covid relief bill Democrats are in the process of crafting could be too large.
It's a move that could bring the health-care law all the way to the Supreme Court for a third time, Amy writes.
He recalled the Winston Churchill quote that meeting jaw to jaw is better than war.
And the D.C. Council tried to subtweet New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after she said she couldn't find a good bacon, egg and cheese sandwich in the capital, but the sandwich they ended up eating looked nothing like the classic New York City rolls:
In her opening statement, Feinstein said she planned to question Barr aggressively about a memo he wrote questioning Mueller's ability to explore whether Trump obstructed justice — which she said demonstrated Barr's sweeping view of presidential authority.
If Congress doesn't approve it, or if I don't approve it, that would mean that Obamacare doesn't have enough money so it dies immediately as opposed to over a period of time, Trump told the Wall Street Journal. If the payments don't get made, he said, Obamacare is gone, just gone.
Barr also testified that in his view, only the attorney general and the deputy attorney general should be allowed to communicate on criminal matters with the White House.
-- But, but, but: There's something discordant about this moment. It's peculiar to watch Democratic candidates warn in apocalyptic terms that Trump is disregarding sacred norms and thereby destroying the republic in one breath while calling for radical steps like packing the Supreme Court, changing the way we pick presidents, ending private health insurance or paying out reparations in the next.
The deadly flu strain hits every state:
What follows is a 30-minute stemwinder that starts with O Little Town of Bethlehem and veers to a treatise on the horse trading between President Lyndon Johnson and Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen over the Civil Rights Act. The sermon reaches a singsong crescendo with Huling in an Ozzy Osbourne rock-star crouch screaming into the microphone.
Donald Trump was not my first choice, but I went with him because he knows what he's doing, and he's a successful businessman, Jamieson explained as she dipped a pita chip into hummus at Marlow's Tavern in Johns Creek during a date with her boyfriend. I don't think he's always making the best choices, but at the same time he's done more in his first 100 days than any president ever before.

Some other events that should be on your radar for the next few days, via GOP lobbyist Bruce Mehlman:
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.
The deal would dwarf the previous record set just weeks ago when free agent Bryce Harper signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for $330 million over 13 years. (Dave Sheinin) The University of Southern California was the most frequently targeted school in the admissions scheme. Six of the 50 alleged perpetrators are current or former employees of the university, which has been at the center of multiple controversies in the last two years. (Moriah Balingit, Susan Svrluga and Nick Anderson) A woman used a T-shirt cannon to launch contraband over a prison fence. The package, which was immediately noticed by prison staff in Sayre, Okla., contained tobacco, marijuana, cellphones and chargers, among other items. (Michael Brice-Saddler)
Only Trump Derangement Syndrome could make something like that possible, Donald Trump Jr. told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. (What other explanation could there be?)
In another tense meeting, top pharmaceutical executives were told bluntly it wasn't in the industry's best interests to block the bipartisan Senate bill backed by Trump. If it failed, they were told, they'd see the president of the United States negotiating with Nancy Pelosi [on allowing the government to negotiate drug prices in Medicare], said a person familiar with the meeting.
These are perplexing moves, considering Republicans in Congress, the White House and around the country consistently emphasize state autonomy. The Graham-Cassidy bill to replace Obamacare that temporarily picked up momentum in the Senate would have given states more leeway in how to use Medicaid and individual marketplace dollars. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has sought to loosen the perimeters around how states can run their insurance marketplaces and Medicaid programs.
If these rules were the last the Trump administration were to issue, the protections that it retains might contain the damage. But there is another rule in the works that could be even worse, possibly allowing people to buy relatively unregulated health- ­insurance plans because they are temporary — but that in fact last 364 days of the year. This would drain lots of healthy people out of the Obamacare system, into skimpy insurance plans, leaving higher premiums behind them.
Less than a day in 2018
Ambulance providers argue they've been mostly ignored by lawmakers up until now.
— Trump isn't the only politician making bold promises. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — saying yesterday on CBS's Face the Nation that thousands of people will literally die if the Trump-backed court challenge to invalidate the entire ACA succeeds — promised if elected to cut prescription drug prices in half if he's elected president next year.
OUCH: In this wrenching account in The Washington Post Magazine, Tiffany Stanley tells the story of Alec Raeshawn Smith, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 23. After he went off his mother's health insurance plan a few years later, he learned of the prohibitive costs of insulin in the hardest way imaginable. Nicole Smith-Holt helped her son look for an ACA health plan, but no affordable options were available to him, and he chose to opt out of insurance coverage all together.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on addressing campus sexual assault.
He said he certainly hadn't and that he was not aware of such contacts during the campaign.
Citing J.R.R.'s Tolkien 'Lord of the Rings' epic, Bosworth also expressed serious concern about the possible corrupting influence of Facebook's power, comparing it to the ring carried by the hobbit Frodo Baggins. 'I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear,' [he wrote].
In a paper published in the American Political Science Review, we (along with Stefaan Walgrave, Stuart Soroka and Tamir Sheafer) show that politicians are just as susceptible to the sunk-cost fallacy and other decision-making biases as are regular folks — and sometimes even more so. That finding can improve our understanding of why governments sometimes make questionable decisions, such as pursuing infrastructure projects long after they are exposed as obsolete or escalating commitment to armed conflicts in which they have suffered many casualties.
On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) countered the Trump administration's request for $250 billion in small-business funding with a call for hundreds of billions of dollars for hospitals, local governments and food stamp recipients.
The White House opened its own Web server computer on Oct. 20, the paper informed its readers, and is already logging nearly 20,000 'hits,' or requests for access, each day, making it one of the most popular sites on the Web.
It also does not solve some of the biggest problems that we're actually seeing in tech. So, again, if you are a parent, you are concerned that your kid's brain is being rewired by screens and smartphone use. They are being rewired. We've seen record high levels of anxiety and depression that are in lockstep with increased adoption of smartphones and social media apps. You know who don't let their kids use screens? The people in Silicon Valley. If you go there, you will see there are no screens in sight in these households because they know what they're doing. Tristan Harris said we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for teenagers.
As he prepares to take his position as Utah's junior senator, Romney writes an opinion essay for The Post in which he excoriates Trump — personally, if not on policy.
But the GOP senator also conceded that Trump's rhetoric likely contributed to the large gender gap among voters and the dearth of female Republican candidates elected to Congress last year.
Along with his new role as director of the CMS's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, Smith will also serve as a senior adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar.
Whatever the legal significance of that declaration in this case, as a statement of principle this may loom large later, given what we might expect Trump to try to do on national security grounds, particularly in a time of conflict.
2. Let's revise the secret bill with opinions from the rest of the Senate Republicans. Except: See above.
Unless, of course, Republicans convince people that these estimates are bogus. Even then, though, they will own the eventual product, and if those things do eventually happen, Republicans know they'll pay the price.
And late yesterday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) moved forward on legislation extending protections to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, scheduling a Feb. 25 vote on the measure sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).
Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House coronavirus task force:
— A new analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds the ACA market remained stable through the third quarter of 2019 despite the individual mandate being essentially gutted.
The Senate bill, conservatives hope, will also make able-bodied adults ineligible for the ACA's Medicaid expansion. This could affect as many as 11 million adults covered under the Medicaid expansion who did not become eligible because of parenthood or a disability.
Pro-lifers took the scraps they were thrown from the GOP table because they had nowhere else to go. In today's Democratic Party, abortion is no longer treated as a necessary evil but as something to be embraced and even celebrated. In 2018, for example, New York's Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, lit up One World Trade Center — the Freedom Tower — to celebrate the passage of a new law that removes most restrictions on abortion, even in the third trimester.
January 2017: Trump is inaugurated. Acting attorney general Sally Yates is fired after refusing to uphold the immigration ban.
After being stopped in the Congress from repealing the health care law and destroying the lifeline of Medicaid, the Trump administration has decided to ignore the law and steal lifesaving health care from seniors and families anyway, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.
Rarely, but yes. The last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a Republican, Dick Cheney. That 50-50 split ended after six months when a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, switched parties, giving Democrats a 51-49 advantage. There also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the Congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the Senate Historical Office calls the Great Senate Deadlock of 1881.
Back when Trump won the presidency, The Washington Post's Jenna Johnson offered an indispensable look at just how much he had promised he would do as president — 282 items, to be exact. It was, to put it lightly, a lot. Perhaps in large part because of his lack of political expertise, and perhaps in larger part because of his showman persona and his willingness to just say, well, anything, his mouth wrote a lot of checks that his actions couldn't cash (so to speak).
Where big business has lost its political mojo is on the broad issues affecting the whole economy — the budget, immigration, trade, investments in infrastructure and basic research, tax reform, the environment and health care. It is these issues, which require trade-offs between what is good for the company and what is good for the country, that once demanded attention from executives. In their self-appointed role as stewards of the American economy, they would travel to Washington regularly to attend the CEO-only meetings of the Committee on Economic Development or the Business Roundtable or the Business Council, meeting with presidents, Cabinet secretaries and congressional leaders.
OUCH: Hours after Lindsey McFarland underwent the country's first successful uterus transplant, she was back in surgery with a life-threatening infection that meant the organ had to be removed.
All vaccines carry a risk of a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, which can usually be quickly reversed with medications. While the coronavirus vaccine appears to have a higher risk of allergic reactions than the flu vaccine, the risk is still relatively small (11.1 cases per 1 million vaccinations). Of the 21 people who experienced severe allergic reactions, 17 had a documented history of allergies.
Cortez Masto said she's glad the provision will be included in the relief package. Our ambulance organizations and first responders are working heroically to keep low-risk patients out of the hospital during the coronavirus pandemic, and they deserve to be properly paid for these efforts, she said in a statement provided to The Health 202.
The CFPB completed the rule in November, days before White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney, a critic of the agency appointed by President Donald Trump as CFPB acting director, succeeded former director Richard Cordray. As a South Carolina congressman, he opposed the CFPB's regulatory efforts on several fronts, including payday lending. Payday lenders have said the rule would upend the industry.
He made a facial expression meant to convey something such as I-hate-to-say-it-but.

And in all the talk about Tanden's prolific tweeting, no one is discussing the tweets she sent after Murkowski, Collins and McCain preserved health coverage for tens of millions of Americans. One of them read: We are all cynical but some times political leaders do the right thing. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain, @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins.
Barr also stressed that Mueller could only be terminated for good cause as he was questioned by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) on several facets of the special counsel probe.

And this is all supposed to benefit working people, because … well, because Bannon says the administrative state is their enemy, so it must be true.
We will move right after the first of the year on an Obamacare replacement resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said during a December news conference. Then we will work expeditiously to come up with a better proposal than current law, because current law is simply unacceptable and not sustainable.

— And here are a few more good reads:
It also prompted a Republican super PAC to plan a seven-figure advertising campaign in Nevada to pressure Heller — raising the specter of an ugly intraparty fight that could serve as a harbinger of the political clashes to come during next year's midterm elections.
There are still some rough times ahead for the marketplaces, partly due to Republican actions that are driving up premiums even more than they'd otherwise rise. There are also some faint signs that the marketplace situation is somewhat improving. But it's unlikely either Democrats or Republicas will be talking about the bright spots.
Warnock's identity as a Black preacher has become central to his bid to reach the higher ground of the U.S. Senate. Republicans, who tend to perceive less conflict in the relationship between God and country, have cast him as a dangerous departure from the norm. In a recent debate, a conspicuously scripted Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Republican incumbent whom Warnock is trying to unseat, called him a radical liberal more than a dozen times. A pro-Loeffler attack ad features a video clip of Warnock warning members of his congregation that they cannot serve God and money, or God and the military, at the same time (Matthew 6:24). The ad is spliced with snippets of Warnock yelling during sermons. Over action-movie-trailer music and lo-fi lighting, a grim-sounding narrator explains the threat Warnock poses to the republic: Raphael Warnock attacks our soldiers. Warnock attacks our police. . . . Raphael Warnock is radical and dangerous.
And the trade group representing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) is going for a total PR makeover, fearful its members — as the middlemen between insurers and drugmakers — are being increasingly demonized for fueling price hikes. Mark Merritt, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association [PCMA], announced yesterday he's stepping down at the end of the year — a move sources say reflects members' dissatisfaction with how they're being portrayed in the debate over high drug prices.
Participation in Allegheny County's party committee has never been based exclusively on ideology. The organization has 2,400 elected member positions spread over 1,200 districts, most of them tiny wards or voting precincts. The title of committee member comes with a small role and a smidgen of power in a vast political machine, traditionally run by blue-collar, union-household Democrats whose involvement often resembles a kind of old-fashioned civic engagement.
Week 1378, song parodies about the pandemic
So what will happen if Republicans succeed in turning Medicaid from an open-ended individual entitlement program for the poor into a slowly diminishing block grant to the states? There are three options:
By February, when a blistering inspector general's report found serious derelictions surrounding a 10-day trip he led to Europe last summer, Shulkin had already begun to lose his standing in the White House.
The Texas Republican pointed to lower premiums as his chief goal — one shared by Republicans who say that they'd be able to run on lower health bills in 2018 if they succeed on AHCA.
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.
The new law also automatically suspends payments for six months for the 42 million Americans holding $1.5 trillion in federal student loan debt.
— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed a list of changes to how insurers sell plans within the individual insurance marketplaces, including reducing the fees they pay and allowing them to make mid-year changes to the list of drugs they cover in order to encourage use of more generics. The agency said the change will create a more stable and predictable regulatory framework to make the marketplaces more efficient and competitive.
Spicer personally picked up the phone and connected outside officials with reporters to try to discredit a New York Times article about Trump campaign aides' contact with Russia, then remained on the line for the brief conversations, Axios has learned. … The officials reached by Spicer were CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C), according to a senior administration official.
Czech President Vaclav Havel was an avid baker, but he was often frustrated by his country's supply-chain problems. One day he asked his wife to pick up some ingredients, but she responded, Where, Havel? The flour's gone! (Duncan Stevens)
-- Fresh polling shows most Americans overwhelmingly think witnesses should testify. An AP-NORC poll shows that 7 in 10 Americans say Trump should allow his top aides to appear before the Senate, including most Republicans. The same survey found that 45 percent think Trump should be convicted, 40 percent said he should not be and 14 percent said they don't know enough to have an opinion.

Johnson, like Cruz, has said he does not support the draft of the bill that McConnell released Thursday.
THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
[Trump's health-care positions as a candidate]
The decision, which occurred when Jeff Sessions was attorney general, was a controversial one. A senior Justice Department lawyer on the case resigned in the wake of it. The Justice Department under the Obama administration had vigorously defended the law, which was sometimes referred to as Obamacare.
Over a week of town halls across Iowa and New Hampshire, with four different candidates, the concept of healing the country came up more frequently than Medicare-for-all, or even the Green New Deal that was making national news. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, John Hickenlooper and John Delaney got the same sorts of questions, about how they could win, and how they could then deliver.
As with most nonmilitary federal agencies, the appropriations act that had funded the Justice Department expired, triggering the partial government shutdown on Dec. 22. More than 800,000 government workers have either been furloughed or are working without pay. Justice Department employees involved in criminal investigations and prosecution are among those working without a paycheck.
It is likely that the court already has decided the outcome — justices usually vote within days of oral arguments — and that an opinion is being written, he adds.
I think it's a testament to how racist Americans are that they would vote someone as incompetent as him into the highest office of the United States, Esparza said, as well as suggesting a backlash in response to the eight years of Obama. Like Powell, he suggested that words couldn't express the depths of his frustration.
Needless to say, Trump will do everything he can to incite his mob of supporters to blame Ryan for his loss. The coming civil war should be interesting to watch.
Perhaps McConnell was pondering the fate of a Republican president named Herbert Hoover, who was engulfed by the Great Depression.
As a nod to conservatives, the Senate bill would give states more leeway in opting out of the ACA's insurance regulations through expanding the use of so-called 1332 waivers already embedded within the law, according to the draft proposal. States could use the waivers to make federal subsidies available even off the marketplaces — but they couldn't go so far as to lift ACA protections for patients with preexisting conditions.
Immediately deport undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime, are a member of a gang or pose a security threat. Trump estimates this is 2 million to 3 million people, although experts say the number is much lower. Deport the millions of undocumented immigrants who are in the United States on an expired visa. (Trump removed about 935,000 people during his four years — far short of the millions promised and less than Obama's first term, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.
In the messy effort to rally their often unruly party around a measure to replace big parts of President Barack Obama's health-care law, House leaders have been forced to leave other objectives by the wayside and focus on one simple, political goal: pass a bill they can say repeals Obamacare — even if it has no hope of survival in the Senate — to shield their members in next year's elections.
Other U.S. presidents have decried horror abroad as an affront to values shared among liberal democratic allies, but Trump has made no major address to mourn those gunned down last week as they worshiped at mosques in New Zealand. He has not condemned the professed white-supremacist motives of the accused killer, my colleague Anne Gearan wrote of the president's weekend.
A wall certainly would, but in some places it may not be necessary to have what most people imagine as a wall, Barr said.
— American returning have faced paperwork, delays and other challenges to get home, Siobhán O'Grady, Lenny Bernstein, Anna Fifield and William Wan report. Once they get here, they're being quarantined for 14 days in hotels on military bases, as authorities wait to see whether anyone has the virus.
Health 202: How are you feeling about the Obamacare marketplaces as they stand now? Because as you know we did see average premiums go down this year.
Fresh off a party-line vote in favor of legislation overhauling the tax code, the negotiations will test whether Congress and the White House still have the potential to craft any form of bipartisan agreement, The Post's Jeff Stein writes. If not, the government could soon be on the verge of a shutdown, with pressing questions regarding health care, immigration and other policies left unresolved.
-- For months, Olivia Cross and her husband, Yahya Abedi, an Iranian man, were kept away from each other due to Trump's travel ban and were close to giving up hope on the right to a life together in the United States. Now they've been reunited, but others haven't been so lucky, Kate Woodsome and Jason Rezaian write: Cross and Abedi are experiencing a kind of survivors' guilt, and Abedi is still counseling people stuck in administrative limbo. He is also taking in what it means to be a legal U.S. resident, with a clear path toward citizenship. 'The media in Iran tells us a lot of terrible things about this country, but never any of the good ones,' Abedi said. Asked what has surprised him most about the United States and how he has been treated by the Americans he's met so far, he has only one word: 'Respect.' Abedi hopes other people such as him, waiting to reunite with their loved ones, will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.

And I'll leave it right there with what comes after that. You can figure that one out.
The plan approved Friday, which goes to the full House for a vote Tuesday and then to the Senate Finance Committee, addresses both issues. It calls for able-bodied recipients to lose Medicaid benefits for a time if they fail to participate in work, training or education programs. Exceptions would be made in certain cases.
TRUMP: Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going -- and I think most of you know where they went -- and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq -- but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening.
Okay, let's go, Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) recalled thinking to herself. We have go do it again.
Responding quickly to a crisis has a strong electoral logic, as Neil Malhotra explained here at TMC this past week. Instead of preventing problems like the oncoming consequences of global climate change, lawmakers often wait until hit by a crisis – as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012 or after the global financial crisis in 2008. Capitalizing on crisis lets legislators claim credit and deflect blame, which helps them in the next election, while raising the political cost for opponents who might seek to block action.
Democrats were eager to highlight the potential damage from a ruling to strike down Obamacare — and to change the subject after a summary of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's findings did not establish that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. Some pointed out that relentless focus on health care helped Democrats win control of the House last year.
The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health holds a hearing on legislation to improve Americans' health care coverage and outcomes on Wednesday.
Below are a few reasons this is looking increasingly dicey.
I think as a Republican legislator, I look for where can I get a result — where can I get something that Patty Murray and I and Frank Pallone and Greg Walden all can agree on? Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said at an Atlantic event the day prior, referring to the leaders of the top health committees in the House and the Senate.
On April 26, 2009, when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed, the Obama administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. The administration quickly sought funding from Congress, receiving almost $8 billion. Six weeks later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic.
Then there was the angry Escalade man. The incident did not end when she killed him with kindness. No, Silverman insisted, I want to make this right.
Potentially there could be a conservative, fiscally responsible plan that could attract the support of two, maybe three [senators], Norment said Wednesday. Jones said he was encouraged by those remarks.
Consider, he said, the Democratic insistence on using the government shutdown to try to win extension of the dreamers program, known officially as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. The political calculation here, Davis said, is that you have a president with high negatives and a Democratic base itching for a fight over immigration.
DeMint also reportedly clashed with Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America, the organization's advocacy arm, whose pugilistic approach alienated some congressional Republicans and GOP leaders.
* PRICE IS CONFIRMED, GIVING NEW PUSH TO REPEAL: Early Friday morning, the Senate confirmed Tom Price as health and human services secretary, and Politico comments:
Protect Our Care has distributed a guide to lawmakers advising them to become the Health Care Congress by working on several key goals such as countering the Trump administration's moves to undermine the ACA, strengthening Medicare and Medicaid and striving to lower health-care costs.
-- The Pentagon now acknowledges 50 troops have been diagnosed with concussions and traumatic brain injuries as a result of the Iranian missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq. That's an increase of 16 from late last week when the Pentagon said 34 cases had been diagnosed, CNN reports. Several Pentagon officials [said] that the number of diagnosed cases is likely to continue to change. Approximately 200 people who were in the blast zone at the time of the attack have been screened for symptoms. … Last week Trump said he does not consider potential brain injuries to be as serious as physical combat wounds, downplaying the severity of the injuries suffered in Iraq. … 'I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report, it's not very serious,' Trump [said]. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell sends this statement: Of these 50, 31 total service members were treated in Iraq and returned to duty, including 15 of the additional service members who have been diagnosed since the previous report. 18 service members have been transported to Germany for further evaluation and treatment.
Matt Sparks, a spokesman for McCarthy, said in response to the recordings that the GOP leader has been clear-eyed on what went wrong last cycle and no one is more committed to doing everything necessary to win back the House and execute an agenda that offers every American limitless potential to get ahead.
Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.
— Georgia became the latest state on Friday to pass a bill to prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks of pregnancy. If signed, it would become one of the most restrictive such laws in the country.
Andrew Yang: And what I say to them, I've got a few responses. No. 1 is I say, look, I'd be the last person who would say I was going to run government like a business, because they're two completely different things with different leadership styles. And anyone who thinks otherwise is a moron. And then I say running government will be much closer to what I did running a national nonprofit that had thousands of stakeholders, where you have to try and generate consensus and galvanize energy around a vision that will get people excited. The other thing I say is that Donald Trump is not every non-politician in the world, that there are actually many people that are sound human beings who just want to solve problems. And he should not represent every person who's not spent a career in politics. And No. 3, I say that Americans have been looking for some kind of change agent for years now because we sense that our government is behind the curve. And that's not just Trump and Bernie Sanders's outsized success. But you can even see that in Barack Obama's election in ′08, where people were hungry for some form of change. And we're still looking for it. And the fact is that change is unlikely to come from someone who has spent decades on Capitol Hill.
It's an open wound right now — ask the Freedom Caucus, Collins said. I'm guessing we've all moved on, because it's not going to do any good to open the wound again.
Price indicated Wednesday that the individual mandate remained in place, telling the panel, So long as the law's on the books, we at the department are obliged to uphold the law.
But the move does further Republicans' narrative that they're lightening the load for those people who don't want Obamacare, even though Congress failed to repeal most of the 2010 law. The additional exemptions under review at CMS would apply to the current year (repeal of the mandate doesn't go into effect until 2019) , meaning they could be cited by filers preparing their 2018 taxes next year.
House moderates normally are not the problem group for Ryan, points out Molly Reynolds, a congressional expert with the Brookings Institution.
The hearing was the fourth panel House Democrats have recently convened for the purpose of slamming Republicans for trying to undercut the health-care law even after they failed in their promises to repeal and replace it.
Conversely, the website omits what had been the Republican nominee's call for Congress to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from countries where they are sold at lower prices. This idea has long been favored by Democratic lawmakers but repeatedly blocked by Republicans.
The Zika fight became enmeshed in Republican attempts to shut down an impromptu, daylong sit-in on the House floor in which Democratic lawmakers demanded votes on gun control measures in the wake of the Orlando massacre.
TRUMP: I don't support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault.
Congress must act to protect those who cannot protect themselves, Wagner said in a statement. To my colleagues, this is the simplest vote you will ever take: either you support babies being killed after they are born or you don't. It is time to go on the record and make clear if you think babies born alive deserve medical care, or if you think they should be left to die.
Democrats have refused to support the pay-fors Republicans have suggested to fund the popular program, which is hobbling along on short-term payments that last only through the end of March. Some states have been forced to issue notices to their residents warning their programs could be suspended without funding from Congress soon.
In the ensuing weeks, Trump has since pushed tighter immigration controls, relaxed environmental regulations, pursued tax cuts, advocated stricter curbs on voting, sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act and authorized a military operation against Central American cartels.
This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.
This just goes to show how complicated it is to subsidize people's health care through the tax system, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the midst of tremendous uncertainty for people, it would certainly be helpful if they didn't have to pay back subsidies because they misstated their income.
One of the agencies that GOP governors are defending is the one that sends foreign doctors into medically under-served rural counties. It's almost as if Trump scammed his voters, or something.
4. Let's just vote on the politically untenable House bill and then let Republicans throw a bunch of amendments at it and see what passes. We'll fix it behind closed doors with House Republicans later.
After barely a month in office, Biden is scrambling to explain to some Democrats that his Day One promises for a gentler immigration system will take more time with health and economic crises engulfing the United States.
While the chyron banners tend to be pithy (Ryan: Americans Don't Want Open Borders), they don't have to be, given the ability to change fonts that can cram more words on to a line. On CNN, one day in June, the chyron was practically a paragraph: Trump adviser Roger Stone admits meeting Russian in 2016 about offer of dirt on Clinton in exchange for $20 million.
Reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three and, likewise, greatly simplify tax forms. The tax bill signed into law by Trump left the number of tax brackets at seven and introduced new complexity. Trump regularly touts the tax-cut bill, but it also failed to meet several other specific pledges, such as insuring the largest tax reductions were for the middle class and allowing Americans to deduct child care and elder care from their taxes.
RUBIO: You ever heard of Trump Steaks? You ever heard of Trump Vodka?
GOP does actually have viable options, so let's combat Dems' narrative, Hoshiko wrote.
CRUZ: Because we've been lied to too many times.
Look, it's signed with my name! But I'll take no share of blame,
Primus dismissed Medicare for All during the private session as an unhelpful distraction, according to four people in the room and two people briefed on the meeting, and he expressed a need for more scrutiny of single-payer's policy implications, Adam writes.
— The use of involuntary commitment for drug addiction is on the rise in some states -- and lawmakers want to strengthen or establish laws that will help compel more people to seek treatment, the Associated Press reports. There are at least 35 states with measures that allow families or medical professionals to petition a judge to order someone into drug treatment if the individual could harm themselves or others, Philip Marcelo writes.
First, Cruz is not playing right now to overtake Trump in the delegate race; his goal is to deprive Trump of 1,237 delegates. Cruz therefore should be wary of predicting a wholesale shift in the race — which would imply Cruz matching or surpassing Trump in the next month or so. The name of the game for Cruz is slowing Trump sufficiently so that at the convention Cruz can make the pitch Trump is unfit to be the nominee and will lead to an epic defeat for the GOP. Cruz should keep hammering home Trump's incompetence in the delegate game and make a strong case (since the RNC chairman won't) that the delegate system is transparent, fair and reflects the candidates' relative political skill. (In contrast to Trump who runs and hides, screaming foul whenever he loses, Cruz should welcome the TV time Tuesday night and use it to defend the nomination process.)
Now, the question is whether more senators will join those who oppose the health-care bill in its current form. Each new senator who chooses to do what Heller did on Friday makes the overall task before McConnell and Trump that much harder.
TRUMP: They won't refuse. They're not going to refuse me. Believe me.
President Trump ascended the bulliest of pulpits Tuesday to address a joint session of Congress. It turns out it was his fellow Republicans who needed some bullying — specifically, on their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!
-- In related news, another top E.U. official called for a European army yesterday. The Telegraph's Justin Huggler reports: Hans-Peter Bartels, Germany's national defence commissioner, on Monday called for Nato's EU members to organise their militaries into a single force. 'In the end, there will be a European army,' he said. His comments, on the same day Brexit talks formally began, are a sign the rest of the EU is preparing to press ahead with further defence integration. Britain has repeatedly blocked plans for an integrated European defence policy, but other member states have warned it cannot expect to have a say in the issue post-Brexit. There have been growing calls for a single European defence policy in the wake of Donald Trump's comments that Nato is 'obsolete.'
There's risks on either side, Anthony S. Fauci told The Post, warning that a single-dose strategy could leave people less protected and create public confusion. Fauci said he spoke with health officials in the United Kingdom, who have opted to delay second doses to maximize the number of people with at least partial protection from the first shot. We both agreed that both of our approaches were quite reasonable, he said.
Stephen Colbert reviewed the many ways senators have distracted themselves during the trial:
It would be one thing if we were productively investing all this borrowed or freshly printed money — rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, providing effective job training to displaced workers or improving educational outcomes of our children. These are the kinds of high-payoff public investments that a functioning political system would be making. Instead, we are essentially throwing the money down the drain by using it to finance runaway defense spending and farm subsidies and extravagant tax cuts for businesses that have mostly been passed on to shareholders.
Improvements in recently enacted family and medical leave rules could help many who have been forced to stay home, and a major increase in food stamp payments is essential. Hunger is a real threat, as my Post colleague Catherine Rampell documented last week. And food stamps help more than just hungry people: Economist Mark Zandi showed during the Great Recession that food stamps are a highly effective economic stimulus.

In Austin, Del Bigtree, chief executive of an anti-vax group called ICAN, wore a yellow star during a rally last Thursday to identify with parents who decline to vaccinate their children, Lena writes. A spokesman for Bigtree said he took the action 'to let the Jewish community of Rockland County know he stands with them.'
They think they can deport every undocumented immigrant — without raising labor costs for businesses and prices for consumers.
Trump tweeted praise Thursday for the Senate's swift action, which could help goad skeptical House Republicans: Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!
And ultimately, that's exactly what McCain did. With a famous thumbs-down on the final vote, he saved Obamacare.
But if Democrats win the White House and Senate majority in 2020, the good fortunes of abortion foes could quickly evaporate. Democrats in Congress are trying to broaden abortion rights more aggressively than ever before, targeting even a long-held truce between the parties known as the Hyde Amendment, which governs when taxpayer dollars can — and can't — be used for abortions.
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies holds a hearing on the NIH budget request for 2020.
Order agency and department heads to identify all needless job-killing regulations and then remove them. (Trump ordered such a review in 2017.)
In a controversial move last November, CMS approved a waiver for Georgia allowing it to discontinue use of HealthCare.gov. Instead, the state will redirect consumers to participating Web brokers.
SPEAKER: Our son Matthew Denise, if Donald Trump were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denise and other Americans would be alive today.
Third, the failure of their impeachment drive has dispirited the Democratic base. An Associated Press poll finds that just 33 percent of Democrats are excited about the 2020 election. At the Iowa caucuses, where Democratic voters had their first chance to show their enthusiasm for replacing Trump, turnout was a dismal 170,000 — a 30 percent decline from 2008, when 240,000 Iowans turned out to give Barack Obama his first presidential primary victory.
The appeals process takes a long time, so a lot of damage can be done before it gets to the Supreme Court … and meanwhile everything is stuck, Barr complained.
-- Defense witnesses at Harvey Weinstein's trial disputed his accusers' accounts. Shayna Jacobs reports: One of those witness was Talita Maia, 35, who was at one point a close friend and roommate of Weinstein rape accuser Jessica Mann. Last week, Mann gave dramatic testimony in which she said the powerful movie producer forced her into intercourse on two occasions — once in New York, the incident at issue in the trial. In New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday, Maia was asked to recall the first time she and Mann, 34, met Weinstein … 'She put her arm around him and pinched his cheek,' Maia testified, adding that Mann said he was 'so cute.' … Prosecutors say Weinstein forced sex on Mann at a DoubleTree Hotel in Manhattan on March 18, 2013. 'Did [Weinstein] ever force her to do anything against her will?' defense lawyer Donna Rotunno asked Maia, a Brazilian-born actress, on direct examination. 'No,' Maia testified. 'She spoke very highly of him.' … Weinstein's legal team also called Mexican actress and fashion influencer Claudia Salinas. Earlier in the trial, another accuser, Lauren Young, blamed Salinas for setting her up to be 'trapped' in a hotel suite bathroom with Weinstein. … On Monday, Salinas denied ever walking into a hotel room with Young and Weinstein. … Justice James Burke told jurors that summations are likely to be Thursday and that they would begin deliberating after Presidents' Day. The defense is expected to call several additional witnesses.
Chelsea was born in Little Rock when her father was governor of Arkansas and named for a Joni Mitchell song, Chelsea Morning.
This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
Cotton belongs to a health-care working group of Senate Republicans that includes lawmakers from different parts of the ideological spectrum. The group met Thursday to plot its next steps.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No more free (inaudible).
Facing last-minute glitches and inconsistent signals from the president, some argue that House Democrats could have just pursued their original, more generous bill that the Republican Senate would simply reject. Pelosi argued that taking the time to secure a bipartisan agreement would demonstrate to the public that the parties could overcome differences to work together in times of crisis. That strategy also curtailed a partisan messaging battle – especially from the president himself – from derailing a deal.
The Food and Drug Administration holds a vaccines and related biological products advisory committee meeting Wednesday and Thursday.
All of which is to say that this is probably more viable than at any point since 2011, even as it's still probably a bridge too far (so to speak).
You'll recall that the vehicle Trump used to transform himself from a harmless New York character into a malevolent political force was birtherism — the absurd, fictional and racist claim that the nation's first African American president was not actually born in the United States. I have met Trump supporters who still believe in this thoroughly debunked fairy tale.
WALLACE: You have got to do better than this. TRUMP: This guy has a number one -- the number one absentee record in the United States...
But before getting into that, let's take a step back and appreciate the history of the moment.
But as you know, I mean, there's always a back and forth between the executive and Congress as to how to get this right and it's something president's committed -- the president-elect's committed to getting done.
Pressed whether that report was consistent with his views on communications with the White House, Barr responded: It would depend upon what his understanding is with the attorney general.
I think I might have started as a curiosity, Yang said. I was invited to the Wing Ding because one of the organizers heard me on a podcast.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he plans a floor vote on a Green New Deal resolution that has been endorsed by some 2020 contenders, a bid to force Democrats to adopt what Republicans contend is an unpopular position.
Barr wrote that he also sent a copy of his memo to Emmet Flood, who is working on the White House response to Mueller's probe; Pat Cipollone, the current White House counsel; and Marty and Jane Raskin and Jay Sekulow, Trump's lawyers in the case. Barr wrote that he also shared it with Richard Cullen, the vice president's lawyer, and Abbe Lowell, the lawyer for Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.
Biden was then attacked by Bennet, who said Biden had been rolled in those budget negotiations.
Why was this the case? As a reporter, that's an easy question to answer. For better or worse, we reporters gravitate toward the unexpected and the out-of-the-ordinary, as well as a dramatic storyline. When the ACA marketplaces were ticking along just fine at the end of 2016 – the Obama administration was heavily promoting them and the Healthcare.gov was working well – there was less news to report.
Anti-abortion rights group March for Life:
Azar says his end goal is to transition all prescription drug coverage to Part D, although he admits he'd need action by Congress to get it done.
That meant insurance companies will continue to have to insure lower-income people but aren't getting subsidies to do it. Congress even tried to step in with a bipartisan deal to save these payments. (It didn't get traction.)
This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.
In Alabama, Republican Roy Moore hopes to win a special election to serve in the U.S. Senate — but his campaign is hobbled by allegations that he'd had inappropriate sexual contact with a teen girl several decades before. Trump remains stalwart in his support for Moore. Romney, on the other hand, says that Moore would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation.
In any case, we were almost rid of a riff that essentially cast black voters as dupes.
Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) acknowledged that the body had been forced to make excruciatingly painful decisions. But he said the state cannot rely on Washington's promise to pay 90 percent of the $2 billion-a-year cost of expansion.
4. Trump patted Congress on the back for ditching Obamacare's individual mandate penalty and for passing the Right to Try act and an opioids package.
Excess vaccine doses could also be used on children, for adult booster shots or for additional research.
-- A top pro-Trump group launched ads supporting two of the president's top congressional allies, Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.). CNN's Betsy Klein reports: The $100,000 ad buy is a sign that Trump-aligned groups are rewarding those loyal to the President. … In the past, America First Policies has hit members who did not support the administration's policy initiatives, including then-Sen. Dean Heller on health care and the late Rep. Walter Jones on the tax bill. … The ads feature video of Meadows and Jordan standing with Trump — literally — and urge supporters to call the Capitol switchboard and thank the congressmen 'for protecting America.'
-- A former magistrate judge in D.C. Superior Court, Lori E. Parker, announced her intention to run against incumbent Brianne K. Nadeau for Ward 1's D.C. Council seat, Rachel Chason reports.
Week 1387, drop letters from a movie title
We did learn a lot, Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), the House Rules Committee chairman, said of the meeting. They did not overlay the money, and that's the big question.
Rarely, but yes. The last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a Republican, Dick Cheney. That 50-50 split ended after six months when a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, switched parties, giving Democrats a 51-49 advantage. There also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the Congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the Senate Historical Office calls the Great Senate Deadlock of 1881.
In broad daylight, masked assailants infiltrated North Korea's embassy in Madrid, tied up the staff, stole computers and mobile phones, and fled the scene in two luxury vehicles, Hudson reports.
If states want to go this route, they could use the new funding announced this week, according to the language in the CMS notice. The notice says states may use funds to assess whether potential modifications to the set of benefits included in the state's EHB-benchmark plan or medication of specific categories of benefits will increase affordability for consumers.
The Senate bill would also keep the ACA's Medicaid expansion around for longer, gradually phasing it out over three years, starting in 2021.
That distinction may be a sign of what may be to come, if Barr is confirmed. Several senators have asked Barr to seek ethics officials' advice about whether he too should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's probe. Barr has said he would seek the advice — but he has not committed to follow it.
I feel like I've lived 10 years in the last year, she replied with a sigh.
The ACA's penalty for lacking health coverage was repealed with the 2017 tax overhaul, prompting concerns from Democrats that it would lead to upheaval for consumers who get their insurance through the marketplace.
Barr said no — but he also argued that Booker had been summarizing his views too simply, as even at the time he wrote that, he believed that while marriage was regulated by the states . . . I would have favored unions that were single-sex.
Trump: We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people.
A top Justice Department lawyer wrote a letter to the court stating that the government had reversed its position in the case and that the previous administration had been wrong to argue that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional, Robert Barnes reports. The challenge to the health-care law was argued before the court in November, and a decision has not yet been announced.
KELLY: Go ahead, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me. Just, for the record, I have won 10. He has won three or four. Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him. I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes. That's a lot of votes. And was by far in first place.
But if you asked a more nuanced questions with a middle-ground option, people weren't so anti-earmark. A CBS poll in 2009 allowed people to specify that they would allow Congress to add earmarks to bills, but change the rules about how and when they can be added. That option took a clear plurality, with 44 percent in support, compared with just 29 percent who wanted to eliminate earmarks. Combine that 44 percent with the 15 percent who wanted to leave the earmarking process as is, and Americans preferred allowing some type of earmarks by a 2-to-1 ratio.
-- Sometimes whom you don't hire is just as important as whom you do. Trump recently told Fox News that he will not fill all the vacancies he's entitled to. He explained that not moving to populate the Cabinet departments is a feature, not a bug, of his administration. When I see a story about 'Donald Trump didn't fill hundreds and hundreds of jobs,' it's because, in many cases, we don't want to fill those jobs, the president acknowledged. Many of those jobs I don't want to fill. Those unstaffed jobs will be choke points to block action by the administrative state.
We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
It was not the only time that the Republican snapped at Democrats. At the second and final debate with Lamb, Saccone said his opponent didn't even know the difference between North and South Korea. At his final rally, on Monday, Saccone said that the other side was gripped by a hatred for our country and a hatred for God.
Cheney, a stalwart conservative, was cheered by liberals for her vote.
I told Liam that Grandpa ought to give him whatever he wants to eat for dinner tonight, remarked Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) before she began her questioning.
These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world, the president said. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
Hillary Clinton beat Trump by a wider margin in his new hometown than anywhere else in the country. In our nation's capital, he earned 1.3 votes for every one vote that went to a third-party candidate. D.C. rejected his candidacy thoroughly — but it didn't prevent Trump from moving in to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW.
Bloomberg has also proposed ways to improve maternal health, particularly for African American women — an issue that has increasingly garnered interest from policymakers because of clear racial disparities and a troubling increase in mortality rates overall.
This means supporting news organizations that do their job. … It means patronizing businesses that defend our values and not those willing to go along with undermining them. … it is not O.K. for newspapers to publish he-said-she-said pieces that paper over administration lies, let alone beat-sweetening puff pieces about Trump allies. It's not O.K. for businesses to supply Mr. Trump with photo ops claiming undeserved credit for job creation.
In many ways, it is the classic prisoner's dilemma. If the majority of Republican elected officials work together to confront the false narratives in our body politic — that the election was stolen (it wasn't), that there is a QAnon-style conspiracy to uproot pedophiles at the heart of American government (there isn't), that a Democratic-controlled government means the end of America (it doesn't; it may produce worse policy, but the republic has survived 88 years of Democrats occupying the White House) — all Republicans will be better off. If instead most elected Republicans decide to protect themselves against a primary challenge through their silence or even their affirmation, then like the two prisoners acting only in their own interests, we will all be worse off. (The same holds true for Democrats.)
Majorities tilt against the legislation when told it would result in millions without coverage and would drive up costs, as the Congressional Budget Office has concluded.
When you've got a strong conservative president driving an agenda, Congress will work hand in hand -- just like Ronald Reagan did, he said.
It's this: The outlines of a meaningful blueprint for resisting Trump are now taking shape.
— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is considering dozens of executive orders he'd issue if elected president, including expanding access to cheaper prescription drugs and reversing the Trump administration's rules blocking abortion providers from the family planning program.
On his first night in office, the president directed federal agencies to ease the regulatory burden that the ACA has placed on consumers, the health-care industry and health-care providers. So far, the main action stemming from that directive is a move by the Internal Revenue Service to process Americans' tax refunds even if they fail to submit proof that they are insured, as the ACA requires, Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin explain.
Major democratic decisions can be held up by one judge nationwide, he complained — stressing that it was particularly concerning that some judges had started to weigh in on matters of national security.
The second thought I have on this is that Trump's numbers among independents are quite strong at the moment. In the new Washington Post-ABC News national poll, in which Trump leads Clinton by two points among registered voters, his margin is considerably wider among independents.
AHH: Cecile Richards, who has served at the helm of Planned Parenthood for about a dozen years, is expected to step down from her role as president of the abortion rights and women's health-care organization. Her departure comes on the heels of a tumultuous run for the group, as it's under FBI investigation and faces ongoing efforts by Republicans to ban it from the Medicaid program. Rumors of Richards' departure had been circulating in the liberal political world for months, and there'd even been talk before the 2016 election that she was ready to move on if Hillary Clinton won, The Post's Dave Weigel reports.
The highest-profile ad, and the best, dropped Wednesday from the new Making America Great 501c4 As CNN's Teddy Schleifer reports, the group was founded after the megadonor Mercer family lost confidence in America First Policies, a 501c4 that was intended to bolster the Trump political brand, but fell — in the usual, ironic fashion — to infighting.
Shulkin did not respond to requests for comment.
So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
BAIER: But, Senator Cruz, in 2013, you said you were open -- you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service, you said back then, in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures. Many of your colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, called him a traitor. It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason. Why the change of heart? And why did it take you so long?
Dingell's interest in oversight started when he got elected in 1955 during Dwight Eisenhower's first term. In 1981, he became chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee. The congressman insisted on also chairing the subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
Dr. Redfield did not want his compensation to become a distraction from the important work of the CDC and asked that his salary be reduced, said Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley. Dr. Redfield is being paid in accordance with the formula used to pay the prior three CDC directors. Using that formula, his compensation for this year will be $209,700.
Jonathan Capehart: I mean, one could argue that when President Obama came into office, he was laser-focused on getting health care to as many people as possible. And Obamacare passed, but those Republicans, no Republican voted for it in the House. I'm having a hard time seeing how you're going to break the fever that President Obama thought he was going to do in 2012 simply by your election. How are you going to convince the Americans who are literally willing to die or or stay in dire economic circumstances simply because policies that you'd want to put into place and others want to put into place would benefit someone else?
The two Republican senators at the center of negotiations — Hanger and Wagner — have different goals. Hanger, for instance, seeks the elimination of a hospital bed tax that would be used to pay for the state's share of the expansion, preferring to pay for it out of existing tax revenue. Wagner supports the tax but wants about half the $307 million it would raise to cover the cost of the health-care tax break he seeks for middle-income residents, which he said would amount to about $250 a year for families making $30,000 to $50,000 a year. His plan would use the rest of the bed-tax revenue to bankroll other state priorities, such as higher education and raises for teachers and state employees.
The debt ceiling deadline creates additional opportunities for lawmakers to demand policy concessions in exchange for their votes — if not by Democrats than by Republican factions eager to shrink the government's obligations. Expires-at-midnight governing is here to stay.
We can also learn from experience with the wealth tax, which many European countries abandoned because of the difficulties in calculating the tax and the ease with which it is avoided. Nearly the same amount of money could be raised from the same people by modestly increasing the income tax on investment profits and applying to unrealized gains at death. And rather than imposing a steep tax on estates, it would be simpler and politically more palatable to tax individuals on their inheritances, just as we do lottery winners.
And as soon as Republicans are in the minority, they're going to want the ability to block Democratic legislation.
One Democrat, Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) voted against the resolution, which calls on the Justice Department to reverse its position in the case challenging the law's constitutionality.
It may surprise you to learn that this agenda — which applies conservative principles to today's problems to advance conservative goals — actually is represented in today's GOP field, most significantly by Marco Rubio, but also to some degree by Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich. But those candidates have not been able to make the GOP primary election about their policy agendas, their understanding of the challenges of the present day, their desire to help people to meet those challenges and their vision for the future.
Warren had to show she was a viable, better choice for progressive voters than Sanders. Unfortunately, she seemed to disappear from the debate at moments. Her bumper-sticker answer on bringing all the troops home failed to account for the consequences. She called for an independent commission in the Justice Department to investigate Trump's wrongdoing. Her best answer came in a spirited answer on endemic racism. She threw a punch at former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg for trying to buy his way into the Democratic race, and then accused everyone (except Klobuchar) of either being a billionaire or taking money from billionaires. On the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, she sounded downright reasonable, making the case for taking half a loaf. It was not, however, the sort of forceful performance she needed to topple the front-runners.
Mr. Hanna began working construction jobs at 20 to support his widowed mother and his sisters. He later spent three decades building his own construction and property management business into a statewide powerhouse before seeking elective office.
Could someone come along then later and say, 'You did that for political reasons to help Clinton run in New York — that's a crime,' when he's exercising his prerogative? Barr said. You can see how that would paralyze the government, and that was my concern.
I've spoken about how the far right and the far left are holding our government hostage by engaging in revenge politics and preventing sensible solutions to big challenges, such as health care and immigration, Schultz wrote Monday in a Medium post.
But, Davidson said, Either answer is really distressing.
When it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.
The story of how big business lost Washington would not be complete without a chapter on the ill-fated decision to abandon a long tradition of bipartisanship and align more closely with the Republican Party.
When Cruz started to gain critical mass with Republican voters, it was soft support predicated to a large degree on his not being Donald Trump. When Trump started winning by wide margins, that support fell away, and Cruz gave up.
About 3 million children live with a different adult than they did the year before, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The Census Bureau has found that about 30 percent of children younger than 6 experienced a major change in their family or household status over a three-year period and that those children are more likely to be Black, Hispanic or poor.
That question is no less challenging as the health-care debate moves to the Senate amid deepening political divides across the country triggered by Trump's presidency.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intends to present the draft to wary GOP senators at a meeting Thursday morning. McConnell has vowed to hold a vote before senators go home for the July 4 recess, but he is still seeking the 50 votes necessary to pass the major legislation under arcane budget rules. A handful of senators, from conservatives to moderates, are by no means persuaded that they can vote for the emerging measure.
But as many as 3.2 million children live in poor households that do not file federal income taxes, according to the most recent data from Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. That means the IRS would not have those families' tax data or know whether to send them the new monthly benefit. Parents who do not file taxes are likely to be suffering the worst of the financial shock from the pandemic, which has battered those at the lower end of the economic spectrum.
But clearly, Northam, who ran as a consensus-builder, would rather not ram through a measure as consequential as Medicaid. Which is why he has been courting lots of Senate Republicans, including Stanley.
Instead, HHS' letter back made clear that its head honcho, former Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) -- one of Obamacare's harshest critics in Congress -- and its other leaders are simply following a different playbook for how to handle the marketplaces in a marked shift from the Obama years.
The decision could leave millions of Americans wondering why they didn't get the checks Democrats promised, notably during Georgia's twin Senate races in January. And it could draw opposition in Congress from liberals already unhappy that the bill will not include a gradual increase in the federal hourly minimum wage to $15. Both have ramifications for the 2022 midterm elections.
Are you flummoxed by the many pro-Trump commercials? We have you covered — here they are, ranked.
-- Trump announced that he would delay increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. David J. Lynch reports: The president's decision to delay the increase in tariffs, which would have taken effect March 2, represents a gamble that his personal intervention can smooth the way to a final deal and quiet skeptics who fear he may be too quick to capitulate to the Chinese. Writing on Twitter Sunday evening, Trump said the United States had 'made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues.' Trump, who did not set a new date for the tariff increase to take effect, also said he plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, to finalize terms of the agreement, should the talks continue to make headway. That meeting, which the president had mulled publicly on Friday, is expected late next month.
Romney reportedly was asked to apologize for his rhetoric about Trump during the campaign, an apology he refused to offer. Trump gave the job to ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson.
Our goal is to show young Americans the dangers of misusing opioids and how quickly one can become addicted to opioids — as short as five days — also the extreme lengths to which one can go to feed this addiction, said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who Trump has appointed to head up his anti-opioid efforts.
We're relying on you to clean this place up, Graham told Barr.
Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) has said  if Senate Republicans stand in the way of and obstruct legislation he willing to reform the filibuster significantly or scrap it all together, a spokesperson said yesterday.
Democratic presidential candidates embraced the Green New Deal:
And with Trump's latest move to punt the issue, they are not really pretending this is their priority anymore, Aaron adds.
-- Before Trump's executive order, the administration was on track to put more than 19,000 migrant children in federal detention by the end of the year. Jeff Stein and Andrew Van Dam did the math: The number of children being held by the government grew by about 62 per day since May, after Trump's policy of criminally prosecuting all first-time adult border crossers was implemented. Even assuming that the harsher policy deters would-be migrants and slows the rate of increase, the government was on track to detain an additional 1,000 children every month.
Among those who lost reelection bids last year were three Freedom Caucus members: Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) lost a primary race in a heavily GOP district to a challenger who in turn lost to a moderate Democrat, while Reps. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) and Dave Brat (R-Va.) both lost to Democratic challengers who highlighted their health-care positions.
Heritage Action on Sunday defended the House Freedom Caucus's decision not to support the health-care legislation while striking a conciliatory tone with the president.
Poll: Senate health-care bill is deeply unpopular (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday that legislation to overhaul the ACA would be introduced later this month, after lawmakers return from the recess. He pointed to recent news that major insurer ­Humana would stop selling individual plans on ACA-mandated state marketplaces.
OUCH: Two health-care juggernauts are locked in a battle for patients in western Pennsylvania that could foretell the future of American health care, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. On one side is UPMC, a health system that built its brand on cutting-edge research and university-affiliated hospitals. On the other is Highmark Health, best known as one of the country's biggest health insurers.
— The Trump administration has tapped Brad Smith to be the new director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's innovation center.
The Ways and Means proposal would make a significant change by ending a rule that made the premium subsidies unavailable to consumers with incomes more than about $51,000 for an individual and $106,000 for a family of four — 400 percent of the federal poverty line.
Indeed, Trump sought to appeal to people's patriotism to bridge the divide that lingers after the bruising campaign.
Eliminate the $19 trillion national debt within eight years by vigorously eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, ending redundant government programs and growing the economy to increase tax revenues. (The debt grew to more than $26 trillion and was growing even before the pandemic.)
Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach, the president said in the latter part of his annual agenda-setting speech to both chambers of Congress. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
Health equity experts say that the data is crucial, given that Black people are nearly three times as likely as White people to die of covid-19. This disparity could be exacerbated if vaccines are not distributed equally. Metrics from the states that have reported race data suggest that White people have received a disproportionate share of the vaccines, according to an analysis confirmed by The Washington Post.
Barr said that his assessment was based only on public reports that suggested Mueller's obstruction case was centered on the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director, and Trump's having asked Comey to shut down an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Cruz has made repealing the Affordable Care Act one of the central tenets of his presidential run. He tells voters that he plans to repeal every word of Obamacare, a line that typically gets big cheers. Valde heard those cheers, and Cruz's opposition to the law, at an event earlier this year. He wanted to ask Cruz about his stance but didn't. He says he was kicking myself because of it. So he decided to come to see Cruz again; this time to ask the question.
CRUZ: But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I'm lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.
As for leadership, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Monday eliminating the filibuster is on the table if Senate Republicans fail to support any pending legislation.
-- The Post team is looking back at the unrest King's death sparked in Washington and across the country. As Ann Gerhart, Danielle Rindler and Michael E. Ruane write, His assassination ignited an explosion of rioting, looting and burning that stunned Washington and would leave many neighborhoods in ruins for 30 years. Brandeis University professor Daniel Kryder and his students analyzed over 200 pages of reports from Secret Service and Justice Department officials to track the damage wrought by the chaos.
None of these shutdowns really worked, which is another argument for taking the option off the table. Similar to this shutdown, the 2013 version was basically forced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and tolerated by GOP leaders, even though they had to know it was a fool's errand. Shutdowns are a great way for the more extreme elements of a party to hijack the government for potential leverage, leaving more moderate leaders to figure out the details. A logical solution for those moderates would be to get rid of the shutdown option when passions aren't running so high.
A Fox News poll in 2010 found that 53 percent of Americans supported building a wall to stop illegal immigration, including 60 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of Democrats.
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!
And Trump continued to tweet up a storm, sharing this picture that a supporter posted:
It's not surprising, then, that at the nadir of his early days as president, Trump is returning to a raw and uncut attack on the media. Trump is like a comedian, forever refining his beats. He knows that if he picks on a certain guy in the audience, the rest of the crowd is going to go bananas cause they don't like the guy, either. The more personal he gets, the more they love it.
HHS looks forward to issuing the final rule promptly, spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley wrote me, referring to the proposed Title X changes, although she didn't confirm whether they'll be released today. Oakley said HHS Secretary Alex Azar will be speaking this morning at a pre-march conference hosted by the Family Research Council and confirmed that Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan will be attending the march.

I'd like to hope that fair-minded Republican senators — some, including Murkowski, are still undecided as I write — will examine Tanden's whole record and realize that she is a lot more than the sum of her tweets. At a critical moment, she gave a great Republican senator the benefit of the doubt. That's what I think she deserves this time around.
Researchers have documented a link between low spending levels and racial segregation and inequality. One study found that for students from low-income families, a 10 percent increase in per-pupil spending for all 12 school years was associated with earning nearly 10 percent higher wages in adulthood and a lower incidence of adult poverty.
Two features of the ACA make middle-class and older adults especially vulnerable to high insurance costs. There's a cliff in which premium subsidies end at 400 percent of the federal poverty line and a rule allowing ACA health plans to charge three times as much to older adults as younger ones.
Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, received coronavirus vaccinations in January.
Ireland has gun control. Serious gun control.
Rally Americans around a worthy national goal and they will find a practical way to achieve it.
In a radio interview, Northam said the issue was being blown out of proportion. After Republicans said he supported killing live babies, a Northam spokeswoman said the idea he would support killing infants was disgusting.
— HHS is seeking the authority to reverse an Obama-era policy that barred foster care and adoption agencies from rejecting prospective parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. HHS's Office of Civil Rights argues in a 2020 draft budget request that some of the country's oldest religious agencies in places such as Boston, Philadelphia and Washington have gone out of business because of nondiscrimination requirements that are themselves discriminatory.
On January 14, 2021, HHS announced forthcoming Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder, the White House's drug policy office said in a message obtained by The Post. Unfortunately, the announcement was made prematurely. Therefore, the Guidelines previously announced cannot be issued at this time.
Biden has not been the perfect candidate; he will not be the perfect president. But when voters care to look, they will find someone who can plausibly fill the role of commander in chief and, even more important, can embody the values and display the conduct we want from our leaders. He already demonstrates the depth of character that Trump lacks.
As the Republican presidential race officially dwindles to only Donald Trump, we say farewell to the only man who was standing in his way, Ted Cruz. (Sorry, John Kasich.)
The administration is also preparing new executive orders to reexamine all 14 U.S. free trade agreements, including NAFTA, and the president could start to sign some of them this week.
The next election will have a lot more to do with jobs numbers than Russia, said Barry Bennett, a Trump political adviser during last year's election campaign. If the economy keeps perking along, he said, Republicans could do just fine.
The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations holds a hearing on the rising cost of insulin on Wednesday.
That's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.
But all of this politically fueled debate has less bearing on employer-sponsored coverage, under which roughly half of all Americans get their insurance. The challenges in this space have often taken a back seat to arguments over Obamacare, even though workers are increasingly covered by plans that require them to dig ever deeper into their wallets.
Trump has publicly complained about how his record on health care is viewed by voters. At a March 5 town hall in Pennsylvania, he answered a question about health care by saying his accomplishments had not gotten their due.
-- An off-duty pilot who happened to be flying aboard the Lion Air 737 plane the day before it crashed in Indonesia last October helped regain control of the aircraft after correctly diagnosing that the flight control system was not working properly. The very next day, with a different set of pilots, the very same plane faced the identical malfunction — and the jet crashed, Bloomberg News reports.
On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states. So, you can see that your path is through a contested convention. How do you...
— This week and next, the full House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold two markups of more than 50 bills aiming to address the opioid crisis. According to a schedule released Friday, the hearings will be held May 9 and May 17 and will center on 57 bills advanced by a subcommittee late last month (The Health 202 covered those measures here). Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) has said his goal is to get opioids legislation to the House floor by the Memorial Day holiday.
But he used to say, Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.
After the GOP Congress failed to overhaul Obamacare, the storyline became even more interesting as the Trump administration had to open the ACA marketplaces to consumers once again, despite spending a lot less money on promoting them. And that seems to have meant more people watching or reading the news heard about opportunities to sign up for marketplace plans.
And here's Trump's response to the vote:
This historic settlement came about through the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up and refuse to be silenced, said John Manly, one of several attorneys representing victims. It is the sincere hope of all of the survivors that the legacy of this settlement will be far-reaching institutional reform that will end the threat of sexual assault in sports, schools and throughout our society.
The congresswoman seems to have gotten her wires crossed, confusing total economic growth with tax revenue collections. Her revised claim that Trump's tax cuts are on a 10-year path to pay for themselves is also extremely dicey, so we award Four Pinocchios.
Tell Kilgore to get Obamacare out of the budget, they said.
The census has not had a citizenship question since 1950.
When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said no, a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign.
I'm convinced that the reason why Donald Trump's our president today is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa over the last number of years, he said in Randolph. (Since 2000, the United States has lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs, though economists argue about the causes.)
THE RETURN OF MEDICARE-FOR-ALL: House Democrats on Wednesday will renew their effort to enact Medicare-for-all, arguing the year-long pandemic was a 'wake-up call' to replace the nation's fragmented health insurance system — and betting they can pressure President Biden to embrace a government-run program that he famously rejected, our colleague Dan Diamond reports.
Molly Reynolds, a congressional expert with the Brookings Institution, thinks Congress might have to buy more time by passing another short-term budget.
So what happened? The multifamily house came to be seen as a kind of housing one aspired to leave. Indeed, to move out was to make good. But was it? The dream of the single-family house is tied up with a vision of America as a land of unencumbered individuals, who need nothing but themselves. It's a vision that the current pandemic has shown to be a fantasy.
As progressive activists have privately noted to me, the idea of a solely government-run health-care system doesn't poll well with voters -- that is, if what it might entail is explained to them. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is contemplating an independent 2020 bid, has included Medicare-for-all among a list of policies he's blasted the Democrats for supporting, suggesting they're creating a pathway for President Trump to win a second term by running too far to the political left.
Meet the first primates cloned by tissue cells:
That's about as far apart as they get on any issue, which has delighted a Republican opposition that sees the Democratic primary tacking farther and farther to the left.
Bill Weld. The former Massachusetts governor and 2016 Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee is delivering remarks tomorrow morning in New Hampshire; Republicans expect him to mount a primary challenge to President Trump.
Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could consider a person's health status when determining premiums, sometimes making coverage unaffordable or even unavailable if a person was already sick with a problem that required expensive treatment. The ACA prohibited that, in part by requiring everyone to purchase insurance.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Thomas M. Middleton (D-Charles) said his panel will take up the legislation next week. This is going to set a new high for Maryland, he said. We have to make sure we make every attempt to make health care affordable.
Since Trump's controversial firing of FBI Director James B. Comey last week, the White House has been in full crisis mode.
The GOP also attempted to force Democrats' hands during the 2013 shutdown, when some on the right reasoned that Democrats would have to pass a government funding bill that defunded Obamacare because they couldn't risk a shutdown. But the shutdown happened, and it was blamed on Republicans.
The bipartisan talks crumbled Wednesday after a week of negotiations, despite hints earlier this week that a deal was imminent. Negotiators were working to reach a compromise between a bipartisan Senate bill that would provide $1.1 billion to fight the virus through September 2017 and House legislation that would provide $622 million through the end of the year.
It's a risky proposition for the Riffles, who live outside of Tulsa. He has a benign brain tumor that affects his hormones, and the medications he uses to keep the symptoms at bay can run $1,000 per month. He uses online coupons to cut the cost. That brings his charge down to about $500 when the coupons are particularly generous.
CRUZ: And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.
Some ambulance services say 30 to 40 percent of their emergency calls now results in treatment-in-place instead of transport.
Questioned on whether she had a plan to deal with McConnell, Warren said, I do, then emphasized that in a democracy it was critical to mobilize the public. Short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on, she said.
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! Trump declared.
-- The Capitals beat the Avalanche 4-3. (Isabelle Khurshudyan)
Voters love disruption just like consumers love disruption, said Bryan Lanza, an adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and transition. They actually see him as a disrupter in a broken system that hasn't produced results for the better part of 30 years.
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia, Trump tweeted in July 2018 after a cozy news conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, in which Trump suggested that he trusted Putin over U.S. intelligence on the question of election interference.They would rather go to war than this. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome!
The administration said in the filing that other parties in the appeal are not opposed to the timeline. The motion comes just weeks after the Trump administration moved to urge the appeals court to fully invalidate the ACA after earlier arguing that just certain provisions should be deemed unconstitutional. A group of 16 mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia have appealed the December ruling by a federal judge in Texas that the health care law is unconstitutional because the individual mandate was invalid.
Undergirding the political messaging wars, four states have announced marketplace insurers' initial proposed rates for the 2019 enrollment period. Average hikes range from 9 percent in Vermont to 29 percent in Maryland, according to an analysis by Charles Gaba on his website ACAsignups.net. Requests span a broad range, especially in Virginia, where CareFirst is seeking a 27 percent rate hike for its HMO plans but a 64 percent hike for its PPO plans.
In Santa Rosa County, Fla., only about 40 percent of emergency responders who are eligible to get the vaccine have gotten it or signed up to do so soon. In New York, where around 30 percent of health care workers have declined the vaccine, the state's Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has threatened that anyone who skips a dose now won't be eligible for a priority vaccine later.
As she has gotten older, the decision not to give interviews has been hers. Campaign aides would like nothing more than to have her out front, but Hillary wouldn't intervene, saying once that she wanted to respect her choices like my mother respected my choices. I'm going to let her life unfold at her pace.
Woosley and his wife would be affected.
OOF: If you read The Health 202 regularly (or even occasionally), you're probably aware that Republicans repealed only a single part (the individual mandate) of the massive, multi-pronged 2010 health-care law in their tax bill. Of course that didn't stop President Trump from claiming to have repealed Obamacare -- and about one-third of Americans believe him, a new poll shows.
To start your day with a full political briefing, sign up for our Power Up newsletter.
TRUMP: So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
The second thing is studying what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers who lost their jobs primarily in the Midwest over the last number of years. During that time, you did not see those workers get retrained for new jobs. You saw almost half of them drop out of the workforce, and of that group, almost half filed for disability. So there was not the retraining that you hope would occur. And this is with an industry where we actually saw it coming, where we actually had industry-oriented retraining programs that were an abysmal failure. It's irresponsible for a politician to talk about turning coal miners into coders because they will then leave and they will never have to actually train thousands of coal miners to become coders or employ those coders. The retraining programs by the numbers are more of a fantasy than a policy. If right now, in this time of historic change, our labor market were reorganizing, you would not see multidecade and record low levels of business formation among young people, interstate migration or other forms of entrepreneurship going off a cliff.
President Trump has promised to build a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But his other immigration policies have had greater consequences. (The Washington Post)
Such details are still up in the air and haven't been worked out even in existing Medicare-for-all proposals, Jonathan writes, adding that's particularly true when it comes to money questions. They don't need all the specifics now. Medicare for All isn't going to become law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is the president, he writes. Meanwhile, the lawmakers and staff working on plans have already done more thinking than their conservative counterparts did about mythical, ultimately ill-fated Obamacare replacements.
Fortunately, there's a simple solution: universal single-payer coverage without drug co-pays or deductibles. It's how things work in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (where it has proved entirely financially feasible), and it's the only way to ensure nobody has to make a decision between their money and their life.
The House GOP bill would have repealed and replaced key parts of the Affordable Care Act. It came under consistent criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. Ryan and Trump pulled the bill Friday afternoon after deciding it could not pass — after weeks of negotiations with conservative and centrist Republican members of the sizable GOP House majority.
Why We're Polarized provides a highly useful guide to this most central of political puzzles, digesting mountains of social science research and presenting it in an engaging form. There are two areas of weakness, however, in an overall outstanding volume.
Andrew Yang: There is a saying in business that you make what you measure, and that's not just in business. That's in all organizations, and that's human nature. We have a fixation on numbers and goals. And right now, the primary goals we set as an economy and society are oriented around stock market prices, [gross domestic product] and, to some extent, the headline unemployment rate. Those three measures are leading us in very distinct directions that have less and less relationship with how the average American is doing.
Warren: I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family, she said.

Trump attacked the author of a 2012 Pew Center on the States report for saying his report did not back up Trump's claims of voter fraud. Trump suggested the researcher had changed his tune, but when the report was issued the author repeatedly explained it did not reflect voter fraud. (This claim earned Four Pinocchios.)
Trump allies are betting the strategy will work again by bolstering enthusiasm among his most avid supporters, particularly older white voters in the upper Midwest who clinched his victory the last time. But the approach also risks alienating moderate suburban voters, including those who took a chance on Trump's candidacy in hopes that his dealmaker persona would overcome Washington gridlock.
-- New York Times, For Democrats Challenging Party Incumbents, Insurgency Has Its Limits, by Shane Goldmacher and Jeffery C. Mays: No congressional Democrat in America has lost a primary in 2018. … While national Democrats have celebrated the President Trump-inspired surge of activist energy coursing through the party in their efforts to take control of the House, many of those same leaders have moved to tame that energy, from Colorado to Massachusetts to New York, when it has turned against them.
-- A sign commemorating the death of Bijan Ghaisar was once again stolen. Tom Jackman reports: The Ghaisar family said the theft is an insult to the memory of their loved one. They have been waiting for more than 14 months to find out why the 25-year-old accountant was fatally shot [by U.S. Park Police officers] as he sat, unarmed, behind the wheel of his Jeep Grand Cherokee on Nov. 17, 2017, after a brief police chase in Virginia.
The proposed cuts came in areas that no one seemed to relish, including reparations owed to a wrongly imprisoned man and mental-health fixes backed by a senator who lost his son to suicide.
States have nearly three weeks to apply for a total of $8 million in funding to be used for implementing the insurance market reforms and consumer protections laid out under the 2010 health-care law, according to a notice of funding posted Monday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The funds are left over from a pot of money originally used to help states review insurers' proposed rate hikes.
• Make the U.S. economy reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This promise relies on tougher fuel-efficiency standards accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. To make them run, Biden would install 500,000 public charging outlets.
Collins said in an interview he first learned about the incidents because of The Post's inquiries related to a report last week of an unannounced start of measures requiring security staff to ask visitors about their citizenship.

Trump aides vigorously sought to undermine the book on Wednesday, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying in a statement that it is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.
According to court documents, Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances.
There is nothing wrong with that. I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me. And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.
The survey found 42 percent of the public overall is aware of PrEP, a prescription drug that greatly reduces the chances of acquiring HIV, and just 27 percent say antiretrovirals are very effective and 15 percent believe the drugs can help prevent the spread of the virus.
Biden's dealmaking comes under question: Pressed to explain how he would overcome gridlock in Washington, given staunch opposition from the Republican-held Senate, Biden offered, in essence, a defense of his own dealmaking skills.
NEW MASK GUIDELINES: Federal health officials Wednesday urged Americans to consider wearing two masks as one of several strategies to better protect themselves against the threat of more contagious variants of the coronavirus, our colleagues Lena H. Sun and Fenit Nirappil report.
It put a bigger weight on me in terms of feeling disconnected and far away and not being there, Gottlieb said. There was a fear that, God forbid, if something happened and I need to be home quickly, I just couldn't.
There are currently no sanctioned supervised injection sites in the United States, though numerous cities have sought to open one, as The Health 202 has reported.

On one hand, you don't like handing the other side a potential campaign message at any point, and Democrats will inevitably try to make this into a 'Trump wants to cut your Medicare' argument, Republican pollster Chris Wilson said.
If Saccone pulls it out, Trump will take full credit, but Republicans should forgo celebration and try to figure out why this was remotely competitive. Trump and Saccone dropped their tax message, which seemed to generate shrugs in this blue-collar district. Is the tax plan a help or a hindrance? Trump trotted out all the hot-button themes (e.g. insulting female lawmakers, mocking the press, threatening to execute drug dealers), but those issues may have lost their punch. And frankly, Trump's stump speech sounded stale. In short, Republicans may lack a compelling theme if voters are not particularly inclined to vote Republican in order to boost Trump.
Jo-Ann Armao: And what do you say?
-- Longtime Trump friend and informal adviser Roger Stone defended his Twitter exchanges with Guccifer 2.0, a nom de guerre linked to the Russian intelligence agents who hacked the DNC. Stone said they simply had a brief exchange of direct messages that occurred after the hack. To collude, I would have to have written him before, he told CNN. We would need a time machine to collude. While Stone claimed it was all innocuous, this is the first time anyone in Trump's orbit has publicly acknowledged contact with one of the hackers.
If you want to put it in the simplest terms, robots don't pay taxes. And so if you have more and more work being done by machines, technology, software and artificial intelligence over time, you are in a bit of a bind.
The Senate will be split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, just like in 2001.
6. Who is key to keeping the 50 Senate Democrats together?
No, they f--king did not. … Today, there's literally nobody on the right between those frantically accommodating Donald Trump, on the one hand, and us on the other.
There are also legal questions around how far CMS can go in exempting Americans from the individual mandate. During the Obama administration, federal agencies defined multiple circumstances in which people could be excused from that requirement. For example, people can qualify for a hardship exemption if they experienced a serious financial difficulty such as eviction from their homes or were forced to file for bankruptcy — or they experienced a personal difficulty such as domestic violence or the death of a family member.
In addition to its newscasts, OAN airs occasional documentaries, mainly on topics popular on Breitbart and other sites that specialize in right-wing agitation. In the last weeks of the fall campaign, the channel ran a special titled Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton's Dereliction and Greed.

They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
--The White House has dismissed the remaining members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, a few months after a half-dozen members resigned to protest the administration's health-policy positions, The Post's Ben Guarino reports. A form letter sent to remaining members thanked them for their service and said their appointments were terminated immediately, according to Emory University's Patrick Sullivan, who was appointed to a four-year term May 2016.
[How an angry comic who had a coke habit became the Barbara Walters of podcasts]
More than half of Americans have private health insurance, which many obtain through their employers, who usually subsidize their plans. Many will lose that coverage as unemployment skyrockets. Others purchase insurance on the ACA's individual insurance marketplaces, but some may be priced out of those markets — even with subsidies — as incomes fall.
The level of outrage among liberals varies. While many lawmakers have privately criticized Pelosi about her response to Omar, few would go on the record — a sign of either deep respect for her long-held position or fear of reprisal. Even several of Omar's friends in Congress declined to give interviews on the topic Monday.
-- A federal judge rejected Paul Manafort's motion to suppress critical evidence from his upcoming trial, rebuffing his claim that FBI agents violated his constitutional rights last May when they seized materials from his firm's storage unit. Politico's Darren Samuelsohn reports: The FBI initially entered Manafort's storage unit in [Alexandria] with consent from one of his employees but without a warrant. An agent the same day then described what he saw in his application to a magistrate judge for a warrant, noting there were 'approximately 21 bankers' boxes that could contain documents, as well as a five-drawer metal filing cabinet' that might be relevant to the investigation. Ahead of the Washington trial … Manafort's defense team tried to get the storage-locker evidence suppressed from the case by claiming the agent's initial entry was illegal because the employee didn't have the authority to let them into the locker. But Jackson rejected the defendant's pleading, noting the employee who allowed the FBI agent into the unit was identified as the lessee of the locker, had a key to the premises and also gave the bureau written permission to go inside. -- Prosecutors on Robert Mueller's team want to use written questionnaires to determine whether widespread media attention has biased potential jurors ahead of Manafort's upcoming trial.
Once the resolution is passed by the Senate, the House is quickly expected to follow suit. That is when the committees — the Ways and Means Committee and Energy Committee in the House and the Finance Committee and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in the Senate — will start work.
MILWAUKEEIZING: The Democratic National Committee announced its 2020 convention will be held in Milwaukee. It was minutes before the GOP issued dire warnings: No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee, said Mark Jefferson, director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, in a statement. And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle. It's only fitting the Democrats would come to Milwaukee.
Whatever the details of other modern industrial nations' health insurance systems may be, they all offer coverage on more or less equal terms, regardless of employment status. This is because having a job or not has nothing to do with one's risk of injury or illness, or that of one's family.
Seth Meyers criticized Trump for retaliating against his impeachment trial witnesses:
That singular message referring to gun violence was altered hours later when the president tweeted out an image of his statement in which gun violence was changed to school violence, in a move Colby writes is a bizarre and telling tweak.
So I would say, Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
Looming over Alexander's decision was the fate of every other GOP member of Congress who has run afoul of Trump in recent years. When they have done so, they have often opted to leave elected office rather than try to explain their decisions to their fellow partisans. One of them, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), left the GOP. And they have often been attacked by Trump — in one case, even after his death.

KELLY: Governor Kasich, the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight, broken street lights, dilapidated and vacant houses, and so on. In 2013, Detroit actually declared bankruptcy, which helped, but the schools here remain a big problem. They're $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country. The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe, falling apart, infested with rodents and insects. Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month.
The health-care law not only got rid of the preexisting-condition hurdle but also granted Powers a subsidy that helped her afford her insurance premiums. Every year since, her coverage has gotten more affordable. This year, to her delight, she was able to sign up for a plan that costs $80 monthly with a $2,100 annual deductible.
Amid heightened tensions over the Russian ex-spy poisoning case, President Trump said April 3 that strong relations with Russia would be a good thing. (The Washington Post)
So, I -- I think that we're going to see a just unbelievable tremendous outpouring of support for him. And I think that we have tried to the extent possible through the Presidential Inaugural Committee, I know that they've really been good about warning people about planning in advance to make sure both their travel plans and their arrival times at key events are within a level expectation and planning so that they understand that there's going to be potential delays because of security, traffic, you know, Metro.
A few hours later, before the caucuses began, Parscale appeared on Fox News. He was asked if the anti-establishment energy Sanders's campaign demonstrated reminded him of what Trump enjoyed in 2016. But that wasn't exactly what Parscale wanted to talk about.
Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health:
Just the value gained by having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would be worth billions to the U.S. economy, Yang said, plus savings as incarceration rates and homelessness declined.
I had one conversation with him related to his private representation, and I can describe that for you, Barr told Feinstein.
I'm not sure they can get anything done and survive a court challenge before the election, said Chris Meekins, a former HHS official who is now a health-care policy research analyst at Raymond James, a financial services firm.
Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad — and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States.
All of us are outraged by what happened. And we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.
The objective is and remains to try to achieve a global resolution, White told Reuters's Alison Frankel. Purdue and the Sackler family members, given this litigation landscape, would like to resolve with the plaintiffs in a constructive way to get the monies to the communities that need them, to the people that are addicted ... rather than to pay attorneys' fees for years and years and years to come. You're talking 2,000 cases. How long will they take to go through the court system?
4. What can Democrats do with 50 Senate votes?
A fresh NBC News-Marist University poll helps explain why: Biden leads Sanders 27 percent to 23 percent among likely Democratic primary voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. Steyer places third with 15 percent. No one else breaks into double digits, but 27 percent of likely voters say they remain persuadable.
You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.
Beto O'Rourke is standing on tables talking about the Green New Deal, she said. Elizabeth Warren is making videos about the Green New Deal.
The majority party assigns a chairman for each of the Senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. But when the Senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its Republican and Democratic leaders -- Trent Lott of Mississippi and Tom Daschle of South Dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, and equal budgets for committee Republicans and Democrats, though the majority leader retained the right to advance a measure or nomination from a committee in the event of a tie vote. There could be an effort to reach a similar power-sharing agreement after Jan. 20.

-- Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said there could be a connection between Bharara's firing and investigations into Trump. He noted on ABC's This Week that, while the president does have the right to fire U.S. attorneys, the move is a reversal from Trump's previous remarks indicating he would keep him on board. The White House counsel had also promised that any dismissals would happen in an orderly way. I'm just curious as to why that is, and certainly there's a lot of questions coming up as to whether ... President Trump is concerned about the jurisdiction of this U.S. attorney and whether that might affect his future, said the Maryland congressman. You look at everything surrounding the investigations — there are a lot of questions that need to be asked, but again, the president does have that prerogative. (The Hill)
That case was thrown out against her...
On medical malpractice reform, Cruz said he has written an amendment to reward states with a 1 percent bonus to their federal Medicaid matching funds if they cap punitive damages for medical malpractice actions. It creates an incentive for states to adopt tort reform law, he said.
Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana have also passed laws requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. Eleven states besides Indiana have banned abortions based on either sex, race, genetic anomaly or some combination, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
Twenty-five years ago, there were no women on this committee, Feinstein said.
Democrats are right to be concerned about their nominee's political chops, but they should be more concerned with a candidate's boasting about a socialist pedigree than one claiming to have Native American ancestry. The latter is politically dumb, the former raises questions ranging from electability to capacity for governance to possessing a unifying vision.
RUBIO: I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.
Of 180 people charged with jihadist terrorism-related crimes or who died before being charged, 11 were identified as being from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Sudan or Somalia, the countries specified in Mr. Trump's order. … None of the 11 were identified as coming from either Syria, Libya or Sudan, and none of the 11 were involved in any major U.S. plot resulting in the deaths of Americans, including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Krugman probably wouldn't object to these measures, but he might offer another suggestion. Corporations have entire teams dedicated to finding ways to reduce their payments to the federal government. Maybe in addition to being more benevolent to their workers, they could just pay their taxes.

The first six months after diagnosis is when a lot of critical things happen, Woodruff said, adding that multiple groups have conveyed their concern to Senate Republicans about the change. I don't know who he was trying to satisfy with this provision, other than industry.
Of course, this poll was in the field before Trump began his latest onslaught on the Clintons' personal lives. But, he has been speaking bluntly for months about his plans for the campaign to go after Hillary Clinton, so it's hard to imagine that independents who said they favored Trump over Clinton would be too shocked (or turned off) by his latest tactics.
In 2012 in North Carolina, conservative legislators were pushing to overturn the Democratic governor's veto of a bill that would legalize fracking. Democratic state Rep. Becky Carney had spent days lobbying against the veto, but when the time came to vote, she accidentally hit yes — and became the clinching vote.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on June 20 that Americans will have plenty of time to look at the health-care bill. (The Washington Post)
It's hard to square [the HIV initiative] with these significant cuts, Kates said, referring to Trump's promise in his State of the Union speech to defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
The problem for her is the nagging sense among Democrats that Trump has already gotten the better of her — and their conviction that their party's nominee cannot start out already playing defense. Her problem isn't that she seems dishonest, it's that she seems politically feckless. And in an election where winning is everything, that's worse.
One of the those tools, he said, is budget reconciliation — a process that will pave the way for Republicans to pass a bill gutting major parts of the ACA, including the system of tax subsidies and penalties that Democrats relied on to increase coverage levels.
TRUMP: ... start soon. I haven't even started.
Senator Paul and the president had a productive call, and he reiterated his issues with the current bill — how it isn't serious repeal and what things he will need to be convinced it can lower costs for Americans, Gor said. He remains open to working with the president and his colleagues on making the bill better.
The Club is right to oppose grandstanding measures that will hurt the economy without addressing climate change, such as a carbon tax. Carbon taxes add to the price of everything people buy. They can reduce carbon emissions, but only by cutting people's standard of living by forcing them to drive smaller cars, buy smaller houses or otherwise simply do with less. Many Americans intuitively know this and oppose carbon taxes. Even the liberal state of Washington, which hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1984, voted down two carbon tax initiatives in the past two elections.

Numerous congressional aides close to the drafting of the legislation expressed awareness of these potential pitfalls. Democrats argue that the benefit will dramatically reduce child poverty in a country with one of the highest rates of child poverty in the developed world, according to rankings from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Political money has also altered the role of business in Washington. It has become an article of faith in the media and among liberal Democrats that the Supreme Court's decision in the case known as Citizens United unleashed a tidal wave of corporate money into the political system. Not true. The level of political spending by corporations and their political action committees has remained roughly the same. But because of Citizens United, corporate money has been swamped by the enormous sums spent by individual billionaires pushing their personal ideological agendas.
-- Trump's legal team spent very little time trying to vouch for the legitimacy of the Ukraine conspiracy theories that the president pressed Zelensky to investigate. Aaron Blake calls this a gaping hole in Trump's defense: To the extent that Trump's team tried to argue that the investigations were legitimate, it focused mostly on the idea that Hunter Biden's employment at a Ukrainian gas company was problematic. It spent considerably less time arguing for the theory that Trump actually raised … on their July 25 phone call: that [Joe Biden] sought to help his son by pushing out Ukraine's top prosecutor. Ditto the other investigation Trump sought. In fact, Trump's legal team spent literally zero time talking about the one involving the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and a server that was supposedly in Ukraine. Trump's team didn't utter the word 'CrowdStrike' once in three days.
The Senate Finance Committee split on Xavier Becerra's nomination to head the health department.
I also would do some other things. Let people buy into the Medicare program at 55. We proposed that at the end of the Clinton administration. We didn't get anyplace with it, but we'd figured out a way that you could do it without it costing the trust fund any money — by just charging people a little more … to get into it early. I would argue that an early buy-in might help us reduce the need for high-risk pools. So I'm always looking for simpler ways on existing platforms as opposed to inventing something new to help us get to universal coverage and affordability.
The new videos showed just how close the mob was to reaching Pence, his family and GOP lawmakers:
That addition of three key words to the description of Buttigieg's health plan — who-want-it — represented a strategic pivot for Buttigieg when he started using the phrase early last year. It was almost as though the Democrat anticipated the tricky questions Sanders and other Medicare-for-all candidates would face about paying for such a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. health-care system and whether people would lose their workplace coverage.
Through all the public bashing of his name and agenda, Cruz celebrated. He carefully crafted the record above to help him get this far in the presidential contest. Cruz is running for president in a year that has been dominated by outsiders -- or at least those framing themselves as outsiders -- and he's proven to be one of the few Washington politicians who can keep up with Donald Trump's appeal to the GOP base.
During a hearing on bills meant to curb youth vaping, advocates revived a decades-old fight over menthol cigarettes, a minty flavor disproportionately marketed to and used by African Americans, our Post colleague Fenit Nirappil writes. …While electronic cigarettes have captured more attention as a new product, some African American civic leaders and anti-tobacco advocates say menthol must also be targeted.
— A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
The move came hours after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra led a coalition of 17 Democratic state AGs in filing an appeal to challenge the district court's ruling.
In the short term, though, Ryan leaves behind a record of rising spending and a sharply expanded deficit. When he took office in 1999, the government enjoyed a surplus. Now it's facing trillion-dollar deficits.
That's the opposite of the primary goal of the ACA, which set essential benefits all insurance plans have to cover, like prenatal care. Over the past year or so, the Trump administration has allowed small businesses and self-employed people to purchase health plans that don't cover all those benefits. On Wednesday, it expanded the temporary plans allowed by the ACA from three to 12 months. That means Americans can go a full year skirting ACA regulations if they want to.
The chair of the Senate Health Committee is reintroducing a bill that could steer billions of dollars in additional annual funding to state, local and territorial public health departments, The Post's Dan Diamond reports.
Trump's campaign held a news conference with campaign manager Brad Parscale and Trump's two adult sons near Des Moines on Monday afternoon.
The White House sees Johnson as a likely ally on tax reform and wants to work with him on that. White House officials view his concerns on McConnell's bill as more about taxes than health care.
Warren said she supports Sen. Bernie Sanders's proposal for a Medicare-for-all plan. She cited her past as an academic who studied why Americans go broke, saying medical costs were a major cause of bankruptcies, even in families with insurance.
After the lunch, Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said Trump thinks that that's the one area where we've fallen short and he wants to see us address it...He made that very clear.
Most of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. What makes Leonard Leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says Steven Teles, author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law and a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. He has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.
Here's what we know so far about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during his father's presidential campaign in June 2016. (Elyse Samuels, Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
The executive editor of the Washington Examiner was more skeptical:
When the Trump administration declined to defend the law, courts allowed Democratic-led states such as California and lawyers for the House of Representatives to step in. Kneedler said that because the Biden administration's view of the case had been adequately advanced by those parties, there was no need for additional briefing.
If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.
Telehealth has long been viewed as a solution mainly for rural areas where there are physician shortages. But Helton stresses that it has a much broader application, allowing hospitals to revamp the patient experience by making a larger pool of specialists available to patients virtually instead of subjecting them to the limited resources of whatever hospital they're staying in.
Let me just say that, some of your past statements on the role of attorney general and presidential power are concerning, Feinstein said. She said she would seek to have Barr guarantee he could be independent from Trump.
I can see Bernie trying to get messed with the same way the president got messed with back in our caucus, Parscale said. I can already see the establishment ...
We are confident the court will look past the inflammatory media coverage generated by the misleading complaint and apply the law fairly by dismissing all of these claims, Sackler family members said in a statement.
The Republicans cannot be so stupid as to give him a second crack, because, honestly, he choked, Trump says in an interview with Fox News after that appearance. He wasn't able to get it done. He should have been able to get it done. There is no excuse for it. And you cannot give that person a second chance, unfortunately.
Warren has mostly tried to avoid taking direct shots at any of her rivals during these final days, hoping to emerge as a unity candidate by staying out of the crossfire between Buttigieg and Sanders. There are a lot of folks shooting at other folks, Warren told reporters last night. Democrats cannot do a repeat of 2016. We can't go into a general election divided and angry with each other.
In the Capitol, the GND debate concluded with Republicans mocking the kitchen-sink approach of the resolution — it assumes universal Medicare coverage and employment as part of a phased-in climate plan — and hammering at the botched fact sheet that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez originally published alongside the resolution. At an 11th-hour news conference, members of the House Western Caucus, a group of conservatives, returned to the FAQ's language about how the government couldn't ban farting cows in the 10-year scope of the resolution and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar downed a glass of milk.
In January, the House asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to join an appeal by a group of Democratic attorneys general against the December ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor that the ACA is invalid. In its motion, the House argued, federal law provides that the Attorney General has a right to intervene in litigation to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, and it empowers the House and/or the Senate to intervene to defend a statute on the rare occasions in which the Attorney General fails to do so.
When some House Democrats clapped and cheered after the two-year budget passed, they were scolded by their party leaders.
-- Oleksandr Danylyuk, the former chairman of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, tells the Daily Beast that Bolton was the only person in the Trump administration he trusted to help secure a path forward between the two countries. Danylyuk claims to have maintained constant contact with Bolton in an attempt to secure a meeting between Zelensky and Trump – conversations that he says included reassurances that the U.S. would not freeze aid to Ukraine.
The rating on this fact check has been changed
I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos — chaos, he said. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved.
What changed from 2016?: The rules change was pushed by Sanders allies fighting to diffuse the influence of party leaders following the rowdy 2016 nomination battle. Sanders, however, did not get everything he wanted as elements of the party, including the Congressional Black Caucus, vocally defended the role played by superdelegates. But the restriction on voting in the first round is a significant change.
Will Supreme Court hear this issue? I suspect so — and that will be true no matter how the vote goes, Amar told us of how he foresees this playing out.
Yet it's arguably worse than this. The plans embraced by the likes of Trump and Cruz would not simply deliver a large windfall to the top earners. They would roll back the redistributive policies put in place by Obama, and do more on top of that. Both Cruz and Trump would repeal Obamacare, and any replace plan adopted by the eventual GOP nominee (and the replace plan that Ryan promises to introduce any day now) will almost certainly cover fewer low-income people, for the simple reason that it will spend less government money.
— States could also require most enrollees to pay higher cost-sharing for medications and doctors visits. The cost-sharing could exceed the nominal amounts currently allowed, although no more than 5 percent of enrollees' income.

New Yorker, 'They've got him!' The emotional scene at the R. Kelly hearings, by Jim DeRogatis: Azriel Clary, who, her parents allege, is one of a group of women being held against their will by the singer, attended Kelly's bond hearing, but she did not speak to her parents, or even turn around to look at them, as they sat several rows behind her in Courtroom 102. She stared straight ahead at Kelly, who appeared at the front of the room wearing a black sweatshirt, his face expressionless. On her way in and out of court, Clary held hands with Joycelyn Savage, a woman whose parents say also began a sexual relationship with Kelly, in 2015, when she was nineteen years old. Both women are still living with Kelly in what their parents call his cult.
-- John McCain says to stay tuned on Trump's ties to Russia: There's a lot of aspects of this whole relationship with Russia and [Putin] that requires further scrutiny, and so far, I don't think the American people have gotten all the answers, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said on CNN. In fact, I think there's a lot more shoes to drop from this centipede.
TRUMP: You'll be here a long time.
America's health system is showing why it's not ready for a pandemic.
Our colleagues write the pair of researchers seemed to have come under particular scrutiny as citizens of Iran, one of four countries classified as state sponsors of terrorism by the State Department.
For a new administration aiming to shore up human rights and democracy amid rising autocracy around the world, the United Nations is one proving ground. The forum has not stood still during the Trump administration's insouciance. China has awoken to the world body's potential as a vehicle for its ambitions, leveraging America's retreat to widen its role and reach, working assiduously to weaken the U.N.'s emphasis on individual rights. U.N. member states and officials are adapting fast, heeding Beijing's demands, muzzling criticism and, in some cases, coming to regard the U.N.'s original ethos — including human rights and the rule of law — as expendable artifacts of a bygone era that should cede to a global governance scheme channeling China.
There are major implications of what these senators are saying vis-a-vis Ukraine – and the precedent this will set. They're saying abusing power is not grounds to remove a president from office, which effectively green lights this and future presidents to leverage their public powers for private political benefit.
And this sign language performance that was cut from the Super Bowl broadcast has been viewed more than 1 million times online:
— Three national groups supporting abortion rights filed lawsuits yesterday against the Trump administration over changes to its national family planning policy. One suit filed by Planned Parenthood and another filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union challenge February guidance from HHS's Office of Population Affairs, NPR's Sarah McCammon reports. The guidance emphasizes abstinence and mentions fertility awareness such as the rhythm method or natural family planning, without explicitly mentioning contraception.
As Texas and the Trump Administration fight to disrupt our health care system and the coverage that millions of people rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose office had led the Democratic effort, said in a statement after the court's announcement. American lives depend upon it.
Feinstein read lengthy sections from the memo, noting that Barr had said the president's law enforcement powers extend to all matters, including those in which he has a personal stake, and that the Constitution places no limits on the president's authority to act on matters which concern him or his own conduct.
So far, Biden aides have done just two podcasts: Deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has appeared on ABC News Powerhouse Politics; Biden's choice to be surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, did Ezra Klein's New York Times podcast, the official said.
Another must-do is issuing tens of billions of dollars to communities ravaged by historically strong hurricanes and wildfires. Republicans and Democrats generally agree helping communities rebuild is a core function of the federal government.
KASICH: Well, states -- if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. But hold on a second here with everything else.
I am so frustrated for all the people in West Virginia and across this country that you all have not … stepped up and took more responsibility for this, McKinley said. The fury inside me right now is bubbling over.
From a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire GOP:
But given his diagnosis, the attacks now are striking, if not startling. Our research suggests that one way to view them is that they reveal in-group policing — designed to root out disloyalty at a time when party conflict is high and margins for victory are extremely slim. For people with an intense loyalty to their party, at a time when a single defection can change a vote's result, some even wish harm on their own members who buck the party line.
How another moderate Senate Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, responded to the news, via Burgess:
In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.
This is the Republican-led states' argument: The Supreme Court only ruled the ACA constitutional in 2012 by calling its penalty for lacking insurance a tax. But because Congress has since repealed the penalty, the basis for the law's constitutionality is gone, Republicans argue, and therefore the entire law should now be struck down.
The president said the decision on the deputy was mine, Barr said as the afternoon session of his confirmation hearing began. Rod and I have been talking about . . . his plans. He told me that he viewed it as a two-year stint and would like to use if I'm confirmed, my coming in as an occasion to leave.
Only two Senate Republicans opposed the bill when it passed in 2015: Susan Collins (Maine) and Mark Kirk (Ill.). Kirk is no longer in the Senate, and Collins alone could not block the bill.
An aide then yelled out, Last question.

Still, Cotton broadly opposes the Medicaid expansion that was created under the ACA, as many conservatives do. That leaves Cotton walking a tightrope, which has drawn some skepticism at home that he is playing politics.
Other measures, which were part of the original bill but are now facing intense scrutiny, have also raised questions.
Former chairman Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) passed Graham the gavel with congratulations and a comment, I have every confidence that you'll steer our 200-year-old committee in the right direction. Graham responded: In my view nobody looks over 100 so we're aging well as a committee.
This happened when a refrigeration failure occurred in Ukiah, Calif., jeopardizing 600 doses and leaving workers with just two hours to distribute the vaccines. Health-care workers moved quickly to vaccinate jail guards, an elder-care facility, firefighters and others in the county.
Tim Miller is a former spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and one of the first people known to be diagnosed with TDS. He readily admits that he probably thinks too much about Trump and gets worked up into a lather more than he'd like. But watching these impeachment trial proceedings has hammered home in him something he's long believed.
Complicating matters is President-elect Donald Trump, who this week made several sweeping statements about the timing and substance of his health-care plans.
Underwood called it another immediate and very present threat to the biggest unifying policy in the Democratic caucus. Before Trump's move, Democrats had been in what she politely described as the brainstorm phase of how to tackle the debate between shoring up the existing health-care system or ripping it apart and starting over.
So whenever the economy is on its way back from this recession, everyone will advocate what they've wanted all along, which among other things means Republicans trying to hack away at the safety net. That project may have to be put on hold for a bit, but their commitment to it has not waned.
Wouldn't it be more effective, for example, to talk about every American being able to buy decent health insurance at a cost they can afford, irrespective of income or health condition? Or promise that, within a decade, no working family would be living in poverty? Without specifying tax rates, why not just declare that those with annual incomes above a quarter of a million dollars shoulder a bigger share of the tax burden so that the government could make urgently needed public investments in infrastructure, education and child care? Or that every company share some of its profits with its front-line employees? Why not simply declare that increasing inequality, declining opportunity and great concentrations of wealth and power are the greatest threat to our democracy — and that government urgently needs to do something about it?
It will take years of effort, not merely one election cycle, for the public to associate this agenda, this philosophy of government action and these priorities with the right. And, of course, that effort has to be made, which to date it hasn't been sufficiently.
Trump was asked during an interview with CNBC whether he had any concerns about a pandemic after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had identified a case of coronavirus in Washington state. That was the first sign that the virus might eventually spread via community transmission, but Trump dismissed any concern. Within weeks, Washington state would become the center of the outbreak in the United States.
After being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Trump declines to reject Duke or the Klan in an interview with CNN.
Every chance we have to set or tweak a rule we are doing it, said the senior official. This administration has been more creative and accomplished more when it comes to health care and health than anybody has given us credit for.
Don't ask me why I came here, the second woman shot back angrily. I vote. I have as much right to be here as you do!
Week 1379, puns on song titles
The Senate passed the largest aid package in history Wednesday night, unanimously, with a 96-0 vote. (The four lawmakers who didn't vote are quarantining because of the coronavirus.)
He did not specify what would constitute a red flag — nor did he seem swayed when Klobuchar told him that former attorney general Jeff Sessions had committed to look into changing those rules.
Some Warren allies privately express frustration that Klobuchar got as much momentum out of Iowa as she did, but Warren did not. The Iowa Democratic Party announced Sunday that Warren is poised to receive eight delegates from Iowa to the national convention in Milwaukee, behind the 14 for Buttigieg and 12 for Sanders, but more than the six for Biden. Klobuchar, who represents the neighboring state, received only one pledged delegate.
Any day now, Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at undoing Obama's Clean Power Plan and end a moratorium on federal-land coal mining. This would ensure that the U.S. does not meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
Klobuchar also invoked Barr's controversial memo criticizing the Mueller probe's focus on obstruction of justice as it pertains to former FBI director James B. Comey's firing. But unlike her Democratic colleagues, she did so in an effort to prove that Barr had already laid out other grounds in which the president could be considered guilty of obstruction: if he drafted a false statement, such as about the Trump Tower meeting; if he knowingly destroyed evidence — as he is alleged to have done with a translator's notes — or if he encouraged witnesses to lie by offering them pardons.
-- Roger Stone said he couldn't remember which volunteer gave him the image of a judge with what resembled a crosshairs symbol that led to a full gag order. But he did identify four members of the far-right, men-only extremist group Proud Boys who have been defending him online. BuzzFeed News's Zoe Tillman reports: Stone identified Enrique Tarrio, Tyler Whyte, Jacob Engels, and Rey Perez as his volunteers. Tarrio is chair of the Proud Boys and last week sat behind [Trump] during a speech in Miami wearing a T-shirt that said 'Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong!' Whyte leads a Proud Boys chapter in Florida. Engels has been involved in Proud Boys activities, but says he's a journalist embedded with the group, not a member. Perez identified himself on Facebook as a member of the Proud Boys and was at Stone's house in Florida to tape a podcast over cigars and baked ziti just before the Instagram post imbroglio. … In court last week, Stone didn't share many details about what his volunteers do for him — he told the judge that they perform 'a lot of the clerical work' — but he said Engels had access to his Instagram account, Whyte posted to his Facebook account, and that multiple people had access to his phone.
TRUMP: ... By taking the course.
But an MSNBC anchor refocused Ivanka's argument on recent teacher protests:
As of January 23, 2019, I am officially stepping down from Congress, he said in a statement. Having spent over two decades serving the public, I have chosen to take a position in the private sector where I can use both my legal and business experience to create jobs around the nation.
RUBIO: And he's asking us to make him the president of the United States of America.
The White House said Monday that Trump's budget, which calls for changing hospital reimbursement rates and finding savings on drug prices, does not amount to cuts for Medicare or change the program structurally.
-- Despite the chaos and the growing credibility gap, Trump is systematically succeeding in his quest to deconstruct the administrative state, as his chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon puts it. He's pursued the most aggressive regulatory rollback since Ronald Reagan, especially on environmental issues, with a series of bills and executive orders. He's placed devoted ideologues into perches from which they can stop aggressively enforcing laws that conservatives don't like. By not filling certain posts, he's ensuring that certain government functions will simply not be performed. His budget proposal spotlighted his desire to make as much of the federal bureaucracy as possible wither on the vine.
Speaking yesterday at the World Health Care Congress, Azar said action on drug costs is desperately needed. He listed several problems he said plague drug markets — including high list prices, the government's lack of negotiating tools, rising out-of-pocket costs for consumers and other countries free-riding off the investments of U.S. companies in developing high-cost specialty drugs.
Other Cotton constituents have concluded that Obamacare is not working and want to see lawmakers come up with a functional long-term alternative.
— Azar is officially the next secretary of HHS. The Senate voted yesterday to confirm the former drug industry executive with pristine conservative credentials, ushering in his return to the government's largest domestic agency. Azar formerly held senior roles in the George W. Bush administration, The Post's Amy Goldstein reports. Azar will become the Trump administration's second HHS leader in 11 months, after his predecessor Tom Price resigned over his use of private charter planes.
In a statement, a Juul spokesman said the company welcomes the opportunity to share information about its efforts. We agree that companies such as ours must step up with meaningful measures to limit access and appeal of vapor products to young people, the spokesman said. That's exactly what we've done, and we will do more to combat teen use to save the harm-reduction opportunity for the 34 million adult smokers in the United States.
Buttigieg, a military veteran, said his life experience informs his decisions. As somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities, he said.
The FDA recently released a public list of pharmaceutical companies accused of prohibiting generic companies from buying the drug samples needed to develop equivalent, generic medicines. KHN examined the drug companies listed by the FDA as delaying cheaper competitors and found they've raised prices and cost taxpayers more money over time.
Week 1374, rap battles between historical figures
Republicans have mostly ducked the issue since then, and they were hoping for a reprieve of Trump questions as they headed for Philadelphia. Instead, Trump created a third day of media firestorm early Wednesday, before the lawmakers had even loaded luggage onto their buses, by declaring a major investigation would occur on voter fraud.
Wednesday. Politico hosts an event on health care innovators on
The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who won office last year on a promise to expand Medicaid, called the legislature back for the special session. The opening days are expected to be consumed by the dry procedural moves needed to get a budget bill through House and Senate money committees and then to each chamber for floor votes.
—It's like Democrats and Republicans are still residing on totally different planets when it comes to the ACA. Shortly after Alexander made his comments at the Atlantic event, top Energy and Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone (N.J.) mounted the stage and said he's focusing on ACA fixes precisely because he thinks they can move through a divided Congress.
Florida has 4.4 million people over the age of 65, but as of Friday had administered only 402,000 doses. Despite the demand, it has used only about 30 percent of the vaccine doses it has received.
The day after these remarks, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test. Reports from across the country have documented the scarcity of tests.
Over the last year, Congress has approved billions of dollars in aid for hospitals and other parts of the health-care system. But ambulance and emergency responders have received only a small fraction of that funding, my colleague William Wan reported.
Make illegal immigration a memory of the past. (It hasn't been eliminated as Trump suggested. There was also a huge surge on his watch.)
Ryan openly struggled with Trump, at first declining to endorse his candidacy after he locked up the nomination and then unequivocally backing him weeks before the Republican National Convention.
The Trump administration argued that the elimination of the penalty made the mandate to purchase health insurance unconstitutional, and that the entire law, including such popular provisions as keeping young adults on their parents' insurance policies and ensuring coverage for those with preexisting medical conditions, should fall.
McCreary filed his taxes last month and started a payment plan with the IRS. He will probably have to file an amended return if Congress passes the stimulus bill, which would waive the money he owes on the health subsidy.

Though your brain may turn to polyethylene, resist the urge to reconvene!
AHH: Pelosi's staff has been having early-stage discussions with the White House about potential drug-pricing legislation, Politico's Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer and Daniel Lippman report this morning.
Polarized and competitive parties often fight messaging battles, seeking to win the public to their side when facing off over policy. Not so this time. With the support of their parties, Pelosi and Mnuchin personally negotiated the package, limiting the details of their bargaining. As political scientist E. E. Schattschneider termed it decades ago, the parties narrowed the scope of conflict – making it more likely they would swiftly make a deal. Putting the deal on the floor immediately – legislating in the dark – also strengthened leaders' hands before dissenting voices on either side could oppose the concessions embedded in the deal.
Luckily for them, Republican incompetence and heartlessness have again come to Democrats' rescue.
The latest policies follow other moves the company has taken to combat the opioid crisis. In January, Walmart announced it would provide customers with DisposeRx when filling opioid prescriptions, a powder that would help in safely disposing leftover medications.
The odds seem good that Sanders's purported flirtation with primarying Obama will come up during tonight's debate, which begins at 8 p.m. Eastern and will air on CBS. The six other candidates onstage have each realized, to varying degrees, that Sanders could build an insurmountable lead in the hunt for delegates next Tuesday if nothing is done to bludgeon his momentum. The collective action problem complicates efforts to stop Sanders: Everyone wants to promote their own candidacy more than they want to stop Sanders. Going too negative could generate backlash and ill will from party activists. On the other hand, with the field still so fragmented, there are new incentives to try to emerge as Sanders's chief detractor. That's certainly the role that Mike Bloomberg wants to play. Bloomberg, who spent Monday cloistered at the Four Seasons in Orlando for debate prep, reportedly plans to go after Sanders for his gun-related votes.

In its early days, the organization presented itself as a full-service veterans advocacy group. But it also tackled issues outside the usual fare of veterans groups to focus on touting conservative policies that were top agenda items of the Koch network.
At the same time, many chief executives have what one called deep, residual anxiety about Hillary Clinton. Those anxieties have only deepened since the Democratic presidential nominee joined hands with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.) — two anti-corporate crusaders — in her effort to consolidate support from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Just to recap on the schedule yesterday, the president-elect remained in New York, where he held meetings with Martin Luther King III, Reverend James Ford, Scott Rechlor and William Wachtel. He then met with David Gelernter, G-E-L-E-R-N-T-E-R, who's the candidate for science adviser. After that meeting, he met with Joshua Wright, W-R- I-G-H-T, who is a former Federal Trade Commissioner chairman. His last meeting of the day was with Agit Pai, A-G-I-T, last name P-A-I, who is the current FCC chairman.
RUBIO: If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, everything we have on there is made in America. The reason why he makes it in China or Mexico is because he can make more money on it. That's why he's doing it.
(You can learn more about your state's requirements here at the Department of Labor's Career One Stop platform.)
Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American health care, Trump said earlier this month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, claiming that a Medicare-for-all plan would take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans.
Thursday. Kaiser Health News holds a live taping of its podcast What The Health? on
Frankly, it's a disaster, Timmons said.
So, thank you for joining us and being part of this historic process. Good bye.
On same-sex marriage, Barr said he was perfectly fine with the law as it is. He also said he was against discrimination against anyone because of some status of their gender or their sexual orientation or whatever. He also said that it would be totally wrong to fire anyone because they are gay, and that he was extremely concerned about the increase in hate crimes.
In 2012, eight Democrats represented part of the district in the state legislature; after 2016, they were down to one. In 2014 and 2016, Democrats did not even bother to field a challenger to Tim Murphy, the Republican congressman whose resignation forced Tuesday's special election.
Another red-state Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has also said he'll help confirm Azar. The Senate Finance Committee intends to vote on his nomination later this month before consideration in the full Senate.
The good news for Republicans is that this approach may be more popular than the one they're employing right now. The bad news is it's still hugely unpopular and would be a political gamble on a scale we have rarely seen.
Sue the New York Times for publishing accusations from women who say Trump groped them. (Trump didn't sue the newspaper, although he later attempted to do so for its Russia investigation coverage.)
Trump, who has long railed against the standard due process protections available for migrants fleeing persecution, has finally been able to bypass them, at least temporarily.
Rubio, dubbed Little Marco by Trump in the 2016 GOP presidential primary, says what is on the mind of most Republican lawmakers. Breaking with Trump is a huge political risk that most lawmakers still aren't willing to take.
During the first 100 days of his administration, Biden should convene, by executive order, a national Racial Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. This long overdue effort, backed by presidential authority, would finally allow the nation the chance to come to grips with centuries of racial trauma that present a clear danger to American democracy if they remain unconfronted.
Shalala: Well, it's interesting. We had high enrollments in Florida. The places where we struggled with marketplace is the more rural areas, the smaller towns, the places where it's hard to get the kind of volume that you need. Some insurers pulled out but it was because they didn't get big enough market share. So in densely urban areas it worked best, particularly if you get the kind of patient mix you know you wanted to get.
But Samantha writes in some areas, officials are planning to limit or suspend enforcement in cases in which people fall behind in payments because of the shutdown and urged federal workers to contact the local office to arrange payment plans as soon as they return to work after the shutdown.
Not every Democrat trusts McConnell. More than a dozen Senate Democrats — including several considered likely to run for president in 2020, such as Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) — voted against the bill, as did three-quarters of House Democrats.
Democrats are indeed delighted by the recent turn of events.
Politico hosts an event on Opioid Misuse, Hepatitis C and HIV on Thursday.
Seven weeks after the first shots were administered, just 20 states include race and ethnicity data on their vaccine dashboards, even though it is required by the federal government. And even those states have major gaps in their data, with 'unknown' being the first- or second-most frequent category in almost every state, Lola Fadulu and Dan Keating report.
Bennet is a backbencher with little national prominence, but like many of his more well-known colleagues, has said he's interested in running for president in 2020. Dressing down Cruz on C-SPAN is a surefire way to gain fans in the Democratic base.
--HHS Sec. Price told medical-device makers last week that Trump has good reason to like their industry because they incentivize innovation and create jobs -- possibly hinting that the administration wouldn't be okay with an Obamacare repeal bill that retains the ACA's medical-device tax.
In a final exchange with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Barr said he was open to reconsidering the Justice Department's decision not to defend a key provision of the Affordable Care Act in court.
Ryan managed some achievements under the toughest of circumstances. But when he leaves, he leaves a Republican Party that doesn't necessarily have a clear direction on Trump.
After Bill Clinton admitted he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky (just six years older than Chelsea), she was famously photographed as the bridge between her parents, holding their hands as they solemnly walked toward Marine One.
One flight delivered 178 people to Travis Air Force Base outside Sacramento. The other landed there, then went on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, where about 170 people exited. Two more flights are leaving Wuhan and arriving in the United States on Thursday. An additional 195 people who arrived Jan. 28 are quarantined at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif, our colleagues write.
Asked by Coons, Do you want special counsel Mueller to shield no one and prosecute the case regardless of who is affected? Barr responded, I want special counsel Mueller to discharge his responsibilities as a federal prosecutor, and exercise the judgment that he's supposed to exercise under the rules.
But it would be up to Congress to remove restrictions on the government paying for telehealth, because they're embedded in the Social Security Act. And that's difficult to do, because of cost.
Meanwhile, liberal backbenchers, flush from the Democratic takeover of the House, were busy dusting off ideas like debt-free college, Medicare-for-all and something called a Green New Deal, although nobody was quite sure yet exactly what that meant.
Matt Eyles, incoming president of America's Health Insurance Plans, wrote to CMS that the plan would raise costs for most seniors because insurers would pass them directly to only the sickest consumers, instead of spreading around the savings to lower premiums for everyone.

President Trump has said warm weather could slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but experts explain it's too early to know if the virus is seasonal. (The Washington Post)
Lloyd Bing, 61, who I spoke with a bit further north on 14th Street, never found Trump appealing.
You cannot guarantee that there will not be Medicare beneficiaries who will be paying more, Warren insisted.
— Even with the shutdown at least temporarily over, some employees are still struggling to pay for life's basic necessities, including diapers, tampons, pads and adult incontinence products, our Post colleague Katie Zezima reports. Diapers alone can cost a family $70 to $80 a month, according to the National Diaper Bank Network.
Both Hanger and Wagner have expressed dissatisfaction with the House's original work requirement, which critics had derided as a work suggestion because it would have operated on the honor system. Wagner wanted it to have more teeth. Hanger wanted the state to help recipients comply, by connecting them with work or educational opportunities.
AHH: For more than five decades, members of the Sackler family have donated to museums worldwide including the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. But now, the Smithsonian is one of several blue-chip cultural institutions dealing with the blowback from the Sackler family's other legacy — the American opioid crisis, our Post colleague Peggy McGlone reports. The Sackler name has increasingly become tied to the public health crisis and pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma, which manufactures the addictive painkiller OxyContin.

For many, lost jobs mean lost health insurance. Republicans are allergic to the words universal coverage, but no one should stay away from a doctor during a pandemic for fear of the cost. If ever there were a time to expand Medicaid and access to Obamacare, this is it.
I am by nature an optimist, but I don't think broken systems just fix themselves. It takes hard, uncomfortable work. Such work would be rewarded: Denouncing the false narratives and the conspiracy theories is the first step to winning back the college-educated, suburban and young voters Republicans have lost. Who knows, it might provide a path to a national popular-vote victory. Equally important in a representative democracy is how you earn the trust of voters, both those who support you and those who don't.
Tuesday, Trump will host new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, nicknamed Trump of the Tropics, at the White House. The visit affords Trump a chance to celebrate what he considers the beneficial global influence of his 'America First' agenda, and the Brazilian's far-right views on immigration hold a mirror to Trump's own, Gearan reports.
I asked how Trump was doing as president, and he lamented the tax bill (which favored the wealthy) and Trump's positions on immigration. But he summarized the presidency most efficiently with a battery of critiques.
Naloxone is a critical drug to help reduce opioid overdose deaths. Prevention and treatment of opioid overdose is an urgent priority, Gottlieb said. FDA-approved versions of naloxone currently require a prescription, which may be a barrier for people who aren't under the care of a physician or may be ashamed or even fearful of admitting to issues with substance abuse. Having naloxone widely available, for example as an approved OTC product, is an important public health advance, and a need that we've been working on at the FDA.

Conservative thought leaders were also outraged:
There should be bipartisan support for these recommendations — most are already widely shared. Joseph Antos and James Capretta at the conservative American Enterprise Institute have also recommended a special enrollment period and Medicaid expansion in the remaining 14 states.
— Four major insurers -- Cigna, Centene, Molina Healthcare and Anthem – all reported improved profits in the first quarter of 2018, but theor outlooks don't include moves to offer short-term health policies proposed by the Trump administration, Forbes's Bruce Japsen reports. Instead, some of these insurers are considering returning to the Obamacare marketplaces in 2019 after departing them this year.
— And here are a few more good reads:
Trump's use of tariffs has done little to improve the U.S. trade deficit in goods, which reached a record high $891.2 billion in 2018, according to the Commerce Department. After campaigning in 2016 on a promise to fix bad trade deals and bring down the trade deficit, Trump is gearing up for reelection with much the same message.
Conservatives should fight hard against $15 minimum wages, which would hurt the working class; reform disability insurance to help those who can make a contribution in the workplace to do so; and dramatically reduce the burden imposed by onerous occupational licensing requirements.
Announce the U.S. intention to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from the deal. A few months after taking office, Trump tweeted that he had spoken to the presidents of Mexico and Canada about renegotiating NAFTA. I agreed, subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA, he wrote. This appears to fulfill his promise to announce this threat. Eventually, the administration negotiated an updated version of the trade pact, relabeled the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
The House of Representatives on June 21 voted down a conservative immigration bill introduced by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). (U.S. House of Representatives)
But an influx of migrant families — who have far outnumbered unaccompanied children — could create an even more dire situation for the Department of Homeland Security, because they are difficult to house during immigration processing and their cases have clogged the immigration courts. DHS hit a breaking point in fiscal 2019 — when more than 500,000 migrant families presented themselves at the southern border, a record high. Unaccompanied minors also hit a record that year, numbering 80,000.
What is the connection between hard and soft power?
Kelly … had dialed in from a Coast Guard plane as he headed back to Washington from Miami. Along with other top officials, he needed guidance from the White House, which had not asked his department for a legal review of the order. Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office. The president is signing the executive order that we're discussing, the official said, stunned.
The administration's plan follows a 2010 HIV/AIDS strategy that the Obama administration devised and updated five years later.
But NBC News reports that House Republicans are moving away from the bill:
The fate of the marketplaces has been highly politicized, with large premium increases and departures being touted by Republicans as evidence of the failure of the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, on the other hand, see the same facts as evidence of the uncertainty created by the White House and Congress.
As the Albany event ends, a man who addressed the crowd earlier wanders among the cars.
It's important to understand that there were other things going on in the market that affected the CBO analysis. The Trump administration in late 2017 decided to stop making cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments to insurers (We covered this here.) Insurance companies and states responded with a workaround that, ironically, helped boost premium subsidies and made plans more affordable — and increased participation in Obamacare exchanges.
-- The summer humidity will somewhat subside today, the Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Mostly sunny skies and falling humidity greet us as high temperatures by afternoon manage the middle to upper 80s. The sun angle is still quite strong this time of year, but at least we won't have that heavy humidity.
Wednesday. The Kaiser Family Foundation holds a forum on healthcare prices on
Then he's groveling again. You know I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear but not necessarily millions of people want to hear or have to hear.
VICTORY WEEK: The Biden administration [has] launched a nationwide effort to sell the administration's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package — a push that will take Biden, Vice President Harris and their spouses to seven states that Biden won in 2020, our colleagues Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager report.
To be sure, conservatives (a group that decades ago included both Southern Democrats and many Republicans) often fought against new social programs. But once enacted, conservatives frequently accepted or resigned themselves to their existence. The GOP's 1936 presidential nominee, Alf Landon, did call for Social Security's repeal. Yet by the early 1950s, strong bipartisan majorities supported increasing Social Security benefits.
Gun laws are not effective. They simply do not provide for safety. But they do, however, ensure that law-abiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed. They don't care about the law; they don't follow the law. We will protect the Second Amendment when I'm president of the United States.
Pelosi's allies say it's all to protect the House majority, a rationale Pelosi cited while taking questions during a Monday appearance at the London School of Economics. Asked about her 60 Minutes comments about Ocasio-Cortez, Pelosi called the New York liberal wonderful but argued that the 43 districts Democrats flipped in 2018 were right down the middle.
Public health you'll be protectin' if you don't go out infectin',
The reality: Trump is referring to an executive order, mentioned above, but it has no force in law on its own and no one has yet joined these associations. The rules spelling out how the executive order would work have not been issued yet, so Trump is simply making up his millions number.
The caution stems from what's known as the Goldwater rule, which surfaced after a petition signed by over a thousand psychiatrists was published in 1964 by Fact magazine claiming then-GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically unfit to be President. Goldwater, who lost the election, later won a libel suit against Fact. The APA issued a ruling prohibiting mental-health professionals from commenting on the well-being of a public figure who they have not personally examined.
Wednesday. The House Oversight Subcommittees on Healthcare, Benefits, and on Administrative Rules holds a hearing on Program Integrity for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on
I refuse to be politically correct.
The question of the origin of the virus has become increasingly politically fraught amid a geopolitical standoff between China and the United States. Trump has blamed China for the pandemic that has now killed 1.8 million people.
May: FBI Director James B. Comey is fired. Trump takes his first overseas trip.
On March 16, after the House voted 420 to 0 to release the report, Trump tweeted: I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn't matter. On March 20, he said I don't mind when asked whether the public has a right to see the Mueller report. I mean, frankly, I told the House, 'If you want, let them see it,'  Trump said.
With both parties trying to put their best foot forward for November's general election, here are five things to watch in this summer's preliminary elections. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
3. Fund the Children's Health Insurance Program and disaster relief: Lawmakers on both sides generally agree they need to refund CHIP, a program 9 million children rely on that Congress let expire in September. (Right before the holidays, they infused $3 billion to keep it afloat for the next few months.)
Conservatives suggested that they plan to hold a firm line, but they also indicated they are open to some negotiation.
The IRS uses a decades-old software — its MasterFile software responsible for processing individual and business tax filings was developed in 1962 — and a computer programming language called COBOL. The stimulus program has required multiple coding changes, and the agency has at least 16 other databases with taxpayer information, none of which easily can communicate with the other, said a person familiar with the matter.
*States could raise taxes on everyone else to increase their own spending on Medicaid.
Last year, weeks after the government filed its suit, a 59-year-old woman ended up in a coma after receiving injections for arthritis pain. Hours after getting treatment at a South Miami clinic associated with U.S. Stem Cell, the woman felt faint and was vomiting. She was taken to the hospital and spent more than a month in a coma. This is the first time her case been reported.
In fact, some GOP lawmakers have vowed not to hold town halls at all.
At least so far, pro-expansion House Republicans have shown no signs of buckling. But there may be movement in the Senate, where only one Republican has been openly supportive of expansion during the session. But recently, two more have sounded squishy.
Sen. Bill Cassidy speaks at the American Enterprise Institute discussion on paid family leave.
The company's dominance of the worldwide market for TV graphical systems over the next several years turned chyron into a generic term for any on-screen graphic. People would say, 'Let's chyron that, just like they'd say, 'Please Xerox that document, said Mechner.
Which brings us to Trump. Whatever you think of him, he has earned the loyalty of the conservative grass-roots movement, and he has maintained it in a lot of cases despite his conservative impurities. If there is someone who could persuade the grass-roots organizations to go along with earmarks — and against groups like the Club for Growth and the House Freedom Caucus — it might be him. Just as I've argued that Trump could be the one to get Republicans on board with comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship, I think he could do the same with earmarks.
The bill was passed hastily, with little debate and key revisions agreed upon during closed-door meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. The Congressional Budget Office had not analyzed the bill's cost and impact on coverage before it was approved by the House, but the agency's analysis of its original version projected that 24 million would lose insurance by 2026.
The funding opportunity was posted in late April as a five-year grant for which only a single institution, the Duke-Robert J. Margolis Center for Health Policy, was eligible to apply, Carolyn writes. The grant's purpose was to 'to help advance regulatory science to promote the increased availability of safe and effective drugs to the public,' according to the request for application.
Trump has also stepped up his aggressive actions toward agency inspectors general, officials charged with serving as independent watchdogs but who Trump claims are part of a deep state campaign against him.
On Monday, Long came out against the American Health Care Act with a few kind words about the law it was designed to replace. During unrelated votes Monday night, Long could be seen in a lengthy conversation with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).
The officials said they began scouring the country for additional manufacturing capacity after they realized Johnson & Johnson had fallen behind in vaccine production. They soon sought to broker a deal with Merck, one of the world's largest vaccine makers, which had tried and failed to develop its own coronavirus vaccine.

A cautionary tale of Obamacare and reconciliation
OUCH: A California surgeon called into a Zoom court hearing from the operating room.
The food court at the Bowie Town Center wasn't very crowded on Wednesday afternoon, probably in part a function of the cold weather and the Center's being an outdoor mall. It sits a bit south of the city of Bowie, in the northeast corner of Prince George's County. The county overall has a higher density of black residents than Baltimore. Bowie is a largely suburban community.
We're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.
It was a bumpy ride in rainy weather.
A stream of Republicans are traveling there to pay their respects — from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to House Freedom Caucus members, going to Florida this weekend for a retreat. Though his permanent ban from Twitter has hamstrung Trump's penchant for seeking revenge on perceived enemies, Trump is already deciding how to play in the 2022 midterms.
The Fix's Eugene Scott previews the New Hampshire Democratic primary and how the contest could impact the race. (The Washington Post)
He's done a great job. I actually have a lot of enthusiasm for him, Dickstein said. I think he crosses the aisle well, and I think he's very solutions-
The Cincinnati Enquirer once again tweeted this clarification after the National Enquirer ended up back in the news:
Trump said the U.S.-India relationship has never been as good as it is now.
O'REILLY: Do you object to migrants who are getting out of the Middle East and North Africa? Do you object to them coming to the USA?
Cruz himself appears in the video giving an emotional pep talk to his staff, limning it with references to the future. Ronald Reagan, in 1976, came up short, said Cruz, referring to the insurgent campaign that led to Reagan's eventual nomination. I suspect, at that convention, there were a few tears shed ... 20, 30, 40 years from now, the people in this room, the people across this country, will say: I was proud I was part of this.
But Trump did issue a specific plan — what he called the Contract with the American Voter. He even signed it with his distinctive signature and invited supporters to sign their own copies. That plan listed 60 promises, some of which he said he would fulfill on the day he took the oath of office. Others, he said, would be implemented or launched in his first 100 days.
But Ms. DeVos had all of her paperwork in way before and looks forward to a swift confirmation and bipartisan support. She's clearly the most qualified candidate for this position and will really be a huge benefit to the educational system and to children who are desperate to get a great education around the country.
And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.
Another feature of Republican plan gives states the right to opt out of Affordable Care Act regulations that limit how much more insurance companies can charge older customers, who on average consume a lot more health care, than younger ones who tend to use relatively little. Existing regulations say insurers can charge only three times as much. Senate Republicans would increase that to five times as much. The rationale is that the lower premiums will induce more young people to buy insurance without having to resort to a government mandate, which will have the effect of stabilizing insurance markets.
Fix the rigged system. (Trump claimed many things are rigged, but foremost among them was our electoral system. Yet he failed to fix it, by his own admission. Trump spent two months after the 2020 election baselessly alleging that it had been stolen from him.)
Others have more dire predictions and worry that (a) the United States could see a resurgence of infections, and (b) that the virus could return in the fall and winter.
A clip of Democratic Del. Kathy Tran defending her proposal sparked outrage after she acknowledged her bill would allow abortions up to the point of delivery when the mother's health or life was at risk, which The Post's Gregory S. Schneider and Laura Vozzella report is the same as current law.
Jared Kushner issued a rare statement as a White House adviser:
But, similar to lawmakers, BCBSA officials played down signs of improvement, saying things still look deeply uncertain for their members. Even though plans may be making a profit, that's modest, said Justine Handelman, senior vice president of the association's policy office. In most cases, about 1 to 2 percent is what you see on average across the plans.
New filings are pushed back by the number of days the government is closed. When it reopens, Fitch said that judges will need to reschedule everything, shoehorning cases in. Attorney workloads will skyrocket and it's the people who lose out.
Neither group mentioned by name Bandy X. Lee of Yale University, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry who briefed a dozen members of Congress last month on Trump's mental state and helped edit The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.
For years, scientists called on the FDA to investigate the clinics. In the meantime, the company has still been allowed to operate; four patients have been blinded and one woman ended up in a coma. Now, a judge is expected to rule any day on the government's charge that U.S. Stem Cell is openly violating the law and endangering patients.
But the effort to reshape the country's health-care system is not fostering much bipartisanship. Not a single Democrat voted for the House bill, and no Democrats are expected to support the effort in the Senate.
The Club's failure to see this is an example of the core problem with free-market fundamentalism. This view, pushed by libertarians and conservatives blinkered by their ideology, eschews any government response to a public problem. Free-market fundamentalists deny any problem exists or argue that the market's independent working will solve whatever challenge remains. Nothing to see here, they intone. All is well!
Shalala: Well, we'll see. Unless you have volume you can't bring down the cost. There are no tricks to this. Now, we could do something simple. We could adopt the formulary the VA uses. I mean, if you didn't want to let them negotiate, take existing negotiations.
-- Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Benny Gantz, next week to discuss his Middle East peace plan. The meeting comes amid Trump's trial, as well as Netanyahu and Gantz's own troubles at home, where they've both failed to form a government. (ABC News)
Obamacare was for years the GOP's go-to issue, and repeal was long their stated goal and promise to their voters. It was a great electoral strategy.
OOF: Facebook is struggling to deal with the tens of thousands of users spreading false information about vaccines on its platform, which has become a space for part of the anti-vaccination movement as a measles outbreak continues to spread in the United States.
So the way that I would turn this around is I would say, look, we're allowed, of course, to loan our data to these technology companies and we're not going to make every American a contract expert or privacy expert, but we're going to put the power in your hands and say if you loan your data to these companies, then here's what you know will happen. No. 1, there is an audit trail where you will know what they did with your data, particularly if they sold it or resold it. No. 2, if they get money for your data, you get some too. It just gets slipped into your account like on a monthly basis, and then you'll feel better about the fact that it's getting sold and resold. No. 3, you are allowed to turn it off anytime you want. You can walk away and have the right of anonymity and say, Hey, my data no longer appears if I don't want it to.
The research, published in JAMA Network Open, was not designed to prove cause and effect. Rather, it found an association between the decline in overdose deaths in the 32 states and the District of Columbia that had expanded Medicaid at the time of the study.

Angry constituents packed an auditorium, grilled the congressman with questions and peppered him with boos and chants while protesters amassed outside. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
RUBIO: If you're our nominee (INAUDIBLE)...
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) used a Sunday appearance on NBC's Meet the Press to hawk the health-care proposal he drafted with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), which they say was designed to build bipartisan support. Both have been skeptical of the current Senate bill. But on Sunday, Cassidy said he, too, is skeptical that Democrats are serious about cooperation.
She lets enough air out of the balloon before it pops, said one senior Democratic aide of Pelosi's approach to progressives, throwing them something to keep them happy without allowing their proposal to take over the House agenda.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on vaccines and what's driving preventable disease outbreaks.
Gottlieb said he's also trying to ease the ability of companies to prove their generic version of an already approved drug is the same as the branded drug they're trying to emulate. Branded companies often game the system by making it hard for generic companies to buy the 2,000 to 5,000 doses of a drug they need to prove it's the same makeup.
O'Reilly denounces Obamacare as socialism because it uses taxpayers' money to subsidize the poor. The Irish health-care system does the same thing, on a much larger scale, with a hospital system that is directly run by the government. In Ireland, hospital doctors are government employees (although many senior doctors earn substantial incomes on the side from private practice). Everyone in Ireland is entitled to free basic health care in hospitals, and low income people get medical cards entitling them to free doctors' visits and many other services.
Smith says he would eagerly purchase a catastrophic health plan, which would offer low premiums in exchange for high deductibles. At one point, he found a private plan he liked that cost $400 monthly for a family of four, and included good disability coverage and a generous lump-sum payment in case of an emergency.
Our country is in the midst of a great national trial unlike any it has ever faced before, he said.
In the past month, Bloomberg has released a proposal to add a government-sponsored plan to compete with private plans on the Obamacare marketplaces, much like what former vice president Joe Biden wants. The plan also calls for expanded subsidies to help people afford their plans and additional Medicare coverage for dental, hearing and vision care.
It's an issue that both Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration have said they want to tackle but it's unclear whether these conversations will move forward.
PENCE FACES DIFFICULT TEST: Behind Vice President Mike Pence's steady demeanor and steely look since taking charge of the U.S. government response to coronavirus is a cruel truth: He will emerge either as the architect of a successful containment strategy — boosting his own résumé and [Trump's] reelection odds — or deal a potentially fatal blow to his political aspirations, Politico's Gabby Orr reports.
Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) have not yet announced how they plan to vote.
Among Trump's closest confidants are those urging him to abandon hard-liners in the Republican conference and strike a deal with Democrats on health care and on other issues.
You have it within your power to follow the ethics advice of your own department and you're telling us you're not going to, Hirono said.
The 150-page bill had 93 co-sponsors as of Tuesday, although Jayapal spokesman Vedant Patel said more Democrats have signed on since then. That's still fewer than the 124 Democrats who co-sponsored a much less detailed Medicare-for-all proposal from then-Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) last year. A strategist who has been working with Democrats on health-care ideas told me there have been some frustrations that more members haven't yet signed on to Jayapal's bill, despite the fact that there are 40 more Democrats in the House this year.
Welch sees Sanders as central to Biden's chances of winning support from a progressive left who don't particularly support the Democratic Party as an institution but whom we need to get out to vote.
Most analysts consider control of the House to be in play next year. Following House passage of a health-care bill this month that would leave millions without coverage, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report downgraded the 2018 prospects for Republicans in 20 races across the country.
Wagner's statement Friday did nothing to change their tone.
If the Republicans were to lose the House and Senate and the White House I would say within a year there would not be a pro-life provision left, Tom McClusky, vice president of government affairs at March for Life, told me, though 60 votes are still needed for most Senate actions.
The individual side of the GOP plan includes a variety of proposals:
The report from the House Oversight Committee's subcommittee on economic and consumer policy found high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury in some of the most trusted baby food brands. The committee said that the FDA had failed to warn consumers of the risks, Laura Reiley reports.

In the clip, state House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R) asks Tran: Where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she is about to give birth; would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified? If she's dilating?
These ideas use limited but energetic government to encourage work and earned success, empower individuals, increase their independence and support their best aspirations — all of which conservatism champions. They do not micromanage the economy or the lives of American citizens. They do not require massive new bureaucracies, and they would not dramatically expand federal spending. (They should be paid for by cutting entitlement spending and tax expenditures enjoyed by the relatively well off.) But they do employ government power — intelligently, with appropriate prudence and modesty — to offer a hand up to our neighbors. This doesn't make them less conservative. It is a feature, not a bug.
-- The timing of the reports matters a great deal. The Mueller probe is still not top of mind for most voters. At least not yet. If everything is laid out before the fall elections in an authoritative and official report, perhaps with a lot of new details the public still does not know, it could increase the political saliency of the Russia affair.
Nonetheless, Biden's campaign rolled out endorsements all yesterday from party bigwigs and ex-rivals and appeared in Dallas last night with former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), as well as former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (Texas).
There are many reasons for this, but importantly, people remember that in the Obama years, Emanuel was a regular voice for dialing back ambitions in deference to the backlash from moderates he always feared. Perhaps most famously, after Sen. Ted Kennedy died, depriving Senate Democrats of the 60th vote to overcome a Republican filibuster on health care reform, Emanuel advocated splitting the bill into smaller pieces and trying to pass them.
As Trump addressed hundreds of thousands of supporters from the West Front of the Capitol — a crowd plainly more sparse and subdued than the record one for Barack Obama's historic inauguration eight years ago — scores of violent protesters clashed with police in the streets of downtown Washington.
This is a radical shift, and the way the [Federal Opportunity Announcement] is written, it just flies in the face of the best medical practice, said Tanya Atkinson, president of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, one of the plaintiffs. It is a radical shift that could have a big impact on people's health.
-- Dershowitz also posited during his spirited defense of Trump that impeachment requires the president to violate a specific criminal statute. Now, here I'm making, I think, a very important point: Even if the Senate were to conclude that a technical crime is not required for impeachment, the critical question remains, Dershowitz said. Do abuse of power and obstruction of Congress constitute impeachable offenses? The relevant history answers that question clearly in the negative.
You want to aim before you fire, he said. Let's find the very best people that can do this job that knows the commitment of what they're doing to make sure that they're going to find a solution at the end of the day.
So Democrats have to find some kind of fiscal somersault to try to get the minimum wage increase into the covid relief bill. Maybe they could impose a tax on companies that don't increase their wages, or do something else to satisfy the parliamentarian by cloaking a non-budgetary provision in budgetary clothing.
The billionaire former mayor of New York, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, believes broadly in the value of engaging with American adversaries. We should talk to the North Koreans. I think [President] Trump is right on that, Bloomberg said during a half-hour interview last night. We need China, he added.
Trump visits Utah for the first time as president, the red state that saw the most significant erosion for the Republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. During the visit, Trump goes out of his way to praise Utah Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R), against whom Romney was rumored to be planning a primary challenge.
He also argued that on the whole, Trump's policies put him in line with GOP orthodoxy.
— Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and nonproliferation, announced that his panel will hold a hearing next week on the coronavirus outbreak.
There's really not a need for a replacement of the Affordable Care Act unless and until either there's a final Supreme Court decision that would get rid of it or large parts of it … or until there's a Congress that would actually work with the president on repealing or replacing the Affordable Care Act, Azar said on the radio show.
-- British authorities learned more about the attack near a London mosque that killed one and injured nine, including identifying the assailant. CNN's Angela Dewan, Carol Jordan, Stephanie Halasz and Steve George report: The driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians near a mosque in north London has been identified as Darren Osborne, 47, a resident of Cardiff in Wales, according to multiple UK media outlets … He was being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses, police said … British Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was directed at Muslims and condemned it as 'every bit as sickening' as deadly Islamist attacks that hit the country in recent months.
-- An Oregon man is facing possible hate crime charges after attacking an employee at a Middle Eastern restaurant with a pipe. Go back to your country, terrorist, the 52-year-old allegedly told the man, whom he later described as a Saddam Hussein-looking guy. Get out of America. (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.)
AHH: Rates of coronavirus hospitalizations, infections and deaths are declining, and the rate of vaccinations is accelerating.
What happens next could be determined by a court case in New Mexico, which recently ruled against the payments. That's the justification the Trump administration used to stop them at least temporarily. If these payments don't start back up, it could seriously destabilize insurers that rely on them.
Graham maintains, however, that he supports Mueller's probe. He also sought confirmation from Barr that Mueller was not on a witch hunt. Barr agreed.
But, Wray said, the FBI doesn't care about ideology.
I've been to Republican mass meetings. I've been out and about, ballgames, this and that, Kilgore said. What I've heard people say is, 'Hey, what you said made sense. We don't mind helping people if they're helping themselves.'
--Amazon.com has already made moves into the health-care business as it looks to become a major medical supplier, recently inviting hospital executives to its Seattle headquarters to brainstorm about expanding Amazon Business into a hospital resource. Yesterday, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on Amazon's push into the industry, stocks for health-care distributors tumbled. The company already sells some medical supplies through the Amazon Business marketplace, but is looking to expand its efforts to compete with distributors of more specialized medical products and simplify purchasing for hospitals in the process, reporters Melanie Evans and Laura Stevens write.
Public health officials also worry Super Bowl gatherings could fuel the spread of the coronavirus. Some experts have called on the National Football League to amplify public health messages and urge people not to gather indoors with people outside of their households to watch the game. The Kansas City Chiefs, who will be playing in the game, recently had their own close call with the virus after a barber who was giving haircuts to the team tested positive.
Talk on Zoom, and while you're chattin', the curve will surely flatten,
For 2021, the stimulus bill says anyone who is on unemployment would automatically qualify for the full health insurance subsidy. If the legislation is enacted, these Americans will not get a shock tax bill next year, and they should be able to afford health coverage now.
U.S. life expectancy moved up from 78.6 to 78.7 years, which remains lower than the peak of 78.9 years in 2014.
SPICER: So let me take that -- the -- before -- the first question you asked was on -- on executive orders, right? And so I think that he is working with the entire team, his (ph) legislative and policy shop. So you've got like, you know, everyone from Rick Dearborn and Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus and Stephen Miller, part of that leadership group, if you will.
For a guy who wrote a book, 'The Art of the Deal,' he's just not making good deals, Hogan said. Sometimes, he's his own worst enemy and there is a better way to accomplish things.
But Alexander and Murray can't seem to let the issue go. In a letter to supporters this week, Alexander accused Democrats of being unwilling to make any modest, temporary changes to the Affordable Care Act and essentially washed his hands of the matter, asserting that he's focusing on unilateral ways the Trump administration can change the health-care law.
Under the current U.S. insurance system, about half the country receiving private insurance through their employer, and millions more rely on a government program such as Medicare, Obamacare, or Medicaid. Another 30 million or so Americans have no insurance.
WARREN: I was standing at the desk — I just couldn't sit down. I was too anxious and watching the votes.
That could have been severely detrimental to the ACA a few years ago, Rivlin said. But it's possible navigators are less vital to the law's success five years in, especially since insurance companies now have brokers to help enroll people. Community-based organizations also help out.
From afar, President Trump sought to capitalize on the matter, tweeting from the Group of 20 summit in Japan: All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited health care. How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That's the end of that race!
And what -- what can we expect over the weekend?
In the days after that broadcast, as OFA watched, its Facebook page started to receive angry comments and threats.
AHH: A majority of Democratic voters want lawmakers to take on a national health-care plan such as Medicare-for-all, while fewer than half say Congress should repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, according to a new Harvard/Politico poll.
Fully focus on the presidency and put his three oldest children — Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — in charge of running his company. (Ivanka Trump joined the White House, and there were signs that Trump hadn't completely distanced himself from his businesses.)
I think he's destroying the moral fabric of the country, not that it was so strong to begin with, Cohen said. And the world. I think he's turning the United States into a laughingstock.
— Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) announced the Trump administration has approved the state's request to expand Medicaid retroactively, after more than a year of obstacles for the state's program.
But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.
Lawmakers didn't agree. The industry caused this mess and the industry needs to be responsible for cleaning it up, said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), the subcommittee's chairwoman.
In an updated memo issued last month, Heritage Action said the 2015 measure should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling, for what the Republican Congress and President Trump can accomplish and suggested that a simple majority of senators could vote to overrule the Senate parliamentarian's decisions on which provisions are considered extraneous or not permitted under the budget rules.
But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
A quick and very simplified summary: As companies set increasingly high list prices, they're essentially paying PBMs to include their drugs in insurers' benefits in return for a rebate. Larger rebates mean more money for insurers and PBMs to pocket — which prompts everyone to push list prices higher and higher.
During the final year of his life, with his heath declining, Dingell was determined to recount his experiences in a memoir. Big chunks of The Dean: The Best Seat in the House, which came out in December, deal with oversight, including anecdotes from the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford years.
The New York Times once called the show the most influential program in America — because it included in its audience the most powerful person in the country. Trump offered his praise for that accolade on Twitter.
Amy Goldstein contributed to this report.

The cars were battered to -- like war in Beirut. And all I can say is they murdered him and if Mr. Trump had been in office then the border would have been secure and our children would not be dead today.
Lawmakers drilled the executives on key questions, such as whether they fell short of complying with federal regulations to report suspicious orders, whether their products have contributed to the opioid abuse crisis and how they're ensuring pill dumping doesn't happen again.
Obama has not endorsed anyone, and he's kept his head down as the primary has heated up. Some allies of the former president speculate privately that he wants to maintain credibility with all the factions of the party if there's a contested convention so that he could help mediate. He's previously signaled unease with Sanders's style of radical politics, but Obama's shown no inclination to forcefully or publicly articulate such concerns.
One of the more colorful moments from Tuesday's proceedings was when Mitt Romney showed up on the Senate floor with some chocolate milk:
Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
This year featured an American Spring of racial justice protests inspired by the brutal and public execution of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis law enforcement. Between 15 million and 26 million people took to the streets at the height of the protests, which inspired demonstrations around the world.
To be sure, there are some — including many in Mr. Biden's own party — who regard the post-Donald Trump Republican Party as a corrupted institution with which it is not only morally questionable but also practically impossible to do business. And they have a point: Long before Mr. Trump's presidency, and long before the appalling insurrection of his supporters on Jan. 6, GOP lawmakers often dangled cooperation toward Democratic initiatives such as Obamacare, only to withdraw it like Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie Brown. Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have to earn back trust.
The big problem the CBO faced was that it was trying to model human behavior. The initial assumption was that people were motivated to buy insurance because of the mandate — if an individual did not get insurance, he or she would face a fine. But there were other possibilities: Maybe all the news about Obamacare made people realize that relatively inexpensive insurance (after subsidies) was available in the individual market? Maybe people had developed a stronger belief that they needed to get insurance — and they understood that the Obamacare marketplace was an easy place to find it?
I look forward to solving as many problems as we can, he said.
— A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
Democrats were incredulous that McConnell would view Trump's overtures toward Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and suggestions that NATO is obsolete as something other than policy shifts.
So, I -- I think that would be a good place to start. But I think the president-elect is humbled and honored by the people that are just coming from all over the country to be part of this historic and special day. Not just for him and his family, but for this country and the change that he's bringing.
Researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the block grants this way: While states would be given greater flexibility compared to current law, they would also face fiscal risks in accepting capped federal funding. The breadth of the new flexibility could also result in limits on coverage and access to care for current enrollees, they wrote.

AHH: A new poll from Politico and Morning Consult found most voters are skeptical of Trump's latest promises on health care. Fifty-nine percent said they don't have much trust or any trust at all in the president on the issue. Instead, voters appear to see the issue as one that will be handled by Democrats.
Sarah notes the report was released on Thursday, within hours of special counsel Robert S. Mueller's report, and so it didn't get a ton of attention.
Ryan faced a near impossible task, Republican strategist Doug Heye said. Unite and steer a Republican majority that often wanted to be neither united nor steered, while facing a torrent of outrages du jour from the White House that threatened to hurt enacting the agenda.
Corporate America is hunkered down, watching the wing nuts of the right and left fire over their heads, said W.J. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Democrat-turned-Republican who left a House chairmanship to become the top pharmaceutical industry lobbyist. Politics has gotten so damn mean they simply don't get involved any longer.
When her microphone cut out 47 minutes into her speech, as she talked about taking on Wall Street, Warren joked loud enough so everyone could hear: That was the banks! The raucous crowd rewarded her with standing ovation after standing ovation. Don't tell me what we can't do, she said. We've done it.
Despite the fact that it has been available for decades, prices for insulin have skyrocketed in recent years, putting it out of reach for many patients, the lawmakers wrote. … No American should suffer because they could not afford their insulin. As one of the few manufacturers of insulin in the United States, your company is well-suited to shed light on these issues and offer potential solutions. The Democrats called for further details by Feb. 13 on the average price of insulin products, the annual net profit from insulin products over the past decade and changes that have been made to the product over the last decade, along with an explanation for the cause of rising prices.
I understand that our good friends in the media want to focus on areas of division, Cruz said. The president laid out general principles of reform, and right now both houses of Congress are debating the specifics of those reforms.
* REPUBLICANS WANT PRICE TO HELP WITH TRUMP: The Washington Examiner's David Drucker explains why Republicans think the Price confirmation will help with repeal's momentum:
-- [I]t's difficult to discern any method to the madness that is Trump's trade policy, Matt O'Brien writes on Wonkblog. Indeed, he has alternated between announcing that he's instituting new tariffs and that he's putting them on hold, like a reality-TV show host trying to gin up ratings by keeping people guessing about what's going to happen next. Which, when you put it that way, makes more sense than anything else. Even then, however, we're still left with the question of why, other than maybe force of habit, Trump seems to be trying to run the global economy as if it were just a slightly more involved episode of 'The Apprentice.' And the answer is that, against all evidence, he really does believe, as he has put it, that trade wars are good and easy to win — and that this is how you do it.
Cruz expressed his sorrow for Valde's loss.
While it is rare for the government to switch its position in a case, this change was expected, and this case could be the first of several before the high court in which Biden's administration separates itself from positions held by former president Donald Trump, Robert writes.
Declination memos are written by Justice Department officials when they decline to file charges against individuals, essentially ending an investigation. Those memos are held very closely inside the government and not released to the public. By comparing any Mueller report to a declination memo or a prosecution memo, Barr's answer suggested the long-awaited report from the special counsel may not see the light of day.
Revoke restrictions on new drilling technologies and support safe hydraulic fracturing to create millions of jobs. Lease more federal land for drilling, including vast areas of our offshore energy resources. (Trump routinely expanded drilling and fracking.)

In the meantime, the trustees who run Medicare have projected that its main trust fund will run short of money in 2030. They have urged lawmakers to pass some sort of measure to prevent that.
I know it was not an easy decision to go down this path, Landes said. Unfortunately, it is not right for the long-term fiscal health of our commonwealth and its citizens.
Does this become a healthcare.gov fiasco if every other week there's another news story about a noncustodial father receiving thousands of dollars that should have gone to the mother? said Hammond, who worked on a competing plan for child benefits from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).
Early hire Christopher Wood said he was fired in October 2015 after he decided to lead off a newscast with excerpts from an interview that the family of Michael Brown, the victim in the Ferguson shooting, gave to another network. That was my downfall, Wood said. I got a very, very angry email from Mr. H. saying he wanted the story pulled and we weren't to run it again.
You do have the ability to make regulatory changes that would dramatically lower the cost of insurance for Americans? asked Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.).
A review of Romney's interactions with Trump since the beginning of 2011 — a period covering both men's presidential bids and Romney's Senate race — makes clear that Romney's attacks on Trump are well attuned to the political thermostat. When he wanted Trump's support, for example in 2012, Romney refused to criticize Trump's birtherism — unlike his strong criticism of Trump in summer 2017 after the president waffled on criticizing self-proclaimed white nationalists at a rally in Virginia.
Eventually, the court has to confront the clash between a broad delegation of power to the President — a delegation which gives him a lot of authority to do a lot of not-nice stuff to refugees and visa holders — in a context in which judges normally defer to the president, and the incompetent malevolence with which this order was promulgated.
Barr's exchange with Blumenthal was tense, as Blumenthal sought to get the nominee to say that he found reports that the FBI believed there was reason to launch a counterintelligence investigation against Trump stomach-turning.
On Jan. 28, President Trump's legal team rested their case in the Senate impeachment trial amid uncertainty over whether witnesses will be called. (The Washington Post)
The problem is so acute that some businesses — the very beneficiaries of many of Trump's policies — have proactively embraced the notion of inclusive capitalism, essentially acknowledging that the system is broken if it doesn't work for everyone. Companies such as Bank of America are voluntarily raising their minimum wages; others, such as Mastercard, are enhancing their retirement plans. The Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of some of the country's biggest corporations, last year adopted a new statement of purpose, acknowledging that Americans are struggling, and modernizing its principles to invest in employees and support the communities where its members operate.
I agree with you, Sackler responded. Is there a general agreement, or are there some holdouts?
Lynda Chapman, a trained pharmacist who has a master's degree in health-care policy, expressed confidence that any repeal bill will be good so long as Price signs off on it. I've known Tom Price for over 20 years, she said. He's a good man and has a good heart. You have to trust him because he knows what he's doing.
-- The Frank Robinson I knew: The proudest, orneriest, most competitive man in baseball, by Thomas Boswell: Robinson's leadership — nobody can define it or measure it, which is why few currently value it — was essential. He believed in players who, objectively, did not merit it. So they believed in themselves. … They crashed into walls, stole bases and threw strikes. But most of all, they loved the endless details of the game, studied them, revered them as Robinson did and believed that demanding unfailing fundamentals from one another would win.
Hickenlooper and Yang named China, saying that despite a geopolitical rivalry and economic competition, the United States needed to find a way to work with the Chinese government on climate change and other topics.
President Trump says black unemployment is the best it's ever been in recorded history:
But as members of the working group, Cruz and Lee have argued for a bit less than they got in 2015. All three senators have kept lines of communication open with the House Freedom Caucus — efforts that helped secure votes for a bill that fell short, too, of what House hard-liners had wanted.
-- In northern Georgia, reaction to KKK banner is a sign of the times, by Stephanie McCrummen: The mayor was still home when his phone started ringing. The reverend was still down with the flu when he began getting one message after another. Valerie Fambrough had just dropped off her daughters at day care when she heard[:] 'There's a Ku Klux Klan sign in the town square.' It had a cartoonish drawing of a white-sheeted person raising a hand … and what happened next would become one more pocket of America dealing with a disturbing incident at a time when hate crimes have been on the rise and new brands of white nationalism have been making a comeback across the country. A black pickup truck pulled up … [and the] women heard [the driver] say something about how 'glorious' it was to see such a sign in the light of day, and then he drove off, even as more people were arriving — white-haired locals, college students and others who said they were appalled; a Native American man who brought a ladder and tried to rip the banner down … a young black man who stood there crying. A school bus passed, and now Fambrough was crying as the town dispatched a cherry picker to the scene, and workers began ratcheting out the first of 21 screws holding the banner in place. And that was how the banner came down, and the flags came down, and all the rest began.
TRUMP: Yes, it has been going for a long time.
We didn't eat lunch together, but we did spend time together, he says. I enjoy Donald Trump; he was colorful.
CRUZ: If you didn't tell them that, the tapes will prove you're innocent.
A Post reporter posed this question for followers of both politics and baseball:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters last week that if we do not address the economic consequences of the crisis, that light at the end of the tunnel will . . . be the proverbial train coming at us. Yes, and she signaled Friday that she was willing to put off some of her more ambitious aspirations if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed on the need to build on the existing rescue program. McConnell, having earlier resisted a new bill, said he was ready to do business.
Only Minnesota had a statistically significant decrease in the number of uninsured young children, the report said. Minnesota expanded Medicaid in 2014, as soon as the ACA allowed.
Collins and Murkowski have become close allies. When they band together, they are a force to be reckoned with — and McConnell has learned that lesson the hard way. In early 2014, the Republican leadership expected the two moderate women in their caucus to join Democrats and make the politically tough vote to end a Cruz-led filibuster and allow a final decision on raising the debt ceiling. But the women, tired of being taken for granted, refused.
In response to a question about why Republicans are seizing on the issue of paid family leave, Cassidy explained Republicans take a different approach.
Though the Democratic Party's congressional leaders stood on the dais, more than 60 Democratic House members boycotted the inauguration.
These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.
Refuse to call Iran's leader by his preferred title. I'll say, 'Hey, baby, how ya doing?' I will never call him the supreme leader. (Trump occasionally cast doubt on that title, but has also used it without that caveat.)
The president is already coming under intense pressure from the immigration hard-liners in his Republican base to keep his promise. … He's really starting to anger his base with this, said Roy Beck, the president of NumbersUSA, a group that works to reduce immigration. I've got people really angry and talking about 'He's double crossed us, he's deceived us.' You could say that the troops are restless, and I can't blame them.
What happened? The agency finally was using a later baseline, from the middle of 2017, rather than the 2016 one. Moreover, the agency started rethinking whether removal of the individual mandate would be as dramatic as it once assumed, as the estimate incorporated the expectation that individuals' and employers' full reaction to the elimination of the individual mandate would phase in more slowly than the agencies previously projected. (The agencies also included the Joint Committee on Taxation.)
Biden has decided to substitute those events with frequent appearances on media, both traditional and social. He did so on Sunday, first with an interview on ABC News's This Week and then during a video town hall. Remarkably, the public really can get a sense of Biden's character and strengths in a number of respects. More important, the public can get a reminder how deficient President Trump is when it comes to the basic elements of presidential leadership.
On July 28, 2017, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) cast a vote on the floor of the Senate against repealing the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Barr whether he made it a condition of his nomination that Rosenstein would have to go. Barr said it was not.
Allowing states to create work or volunteering requirements for certain Medicaid enrollees was a core focus for the Trump administration. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under former administrator Seema Verma, granted a dozen states waivers to do so.
The Senate Finance Committee advanced Katherine Tai's nomination to be U.S. trade representative.
The Trump administration originally did not seek a sweeping repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It simply asked that the court nullify provisions that protected people with preexisting health conditions. So the court ruled beyond the administration's position. But Trump now declares that is a win. The refusal to defend the law was a flip-flop from Trump's pledge to retain protections for people with preexisting health conditions. Few legal experts think the ruling will survive the appeal process.
Even when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. Whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's good, says Lew Olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. He was a human rights activist studying at Georgetown Law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the Federalist Society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. Now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. His ears prick up at isolated morsels of Hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … See what I mean? Olowski says. Music to my ears.

Over and over, Buttigieg was the second choice of choice, so to speak, Philip rites. Tallying losses and gains across the field, Buttigieg gained the most support as a second pick, followed by Klobuchar. Yang saw the biggest erosion of support — and didn't gain much support as a second pick.
Trump on health care bill: 'We couldn't quite get there' (The Washington Post)
Trump's approach is a hallmark of a president who eschews strategic planning and preparation in favor of day-to-day tactical maneuvering and trusting his gut. But as he digs in against an emboldened Democratic opposition, Trump has found that his go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics has laid bare his shortcomings as a negotiator — preventing him from finding a way out of what may be the biggest political crisis of his presidency.
CRUZ: And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly. Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.
SPEAKER: I'm Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, who was killed in a violent head-on collision in Mesa.
In the Feb. 6 conference call, McCarthy pointed fingers at the House Freedom Caucus, also noting several of its members lost, and made comments that threaten to rekindle internal resentments inside the House Republican Conference, Mike writes. The Post obtained partial records of the private call.
Andrew Yang: I love the way you frame this, Molly, because I've never met a human who actually reads those things and then walks away and says, I didn't like that particular turn of phrase. I'm not going to consent to this. I mean, it is fake consent. You're just looking at and saying, All right, get out of my way. I'm going to click on it and then hope you don't do anything too bad with my data, because the bargaining power is so extremely one-sided. I mean, you have quasi-monopolies in these tech fields where you feel like what are you going to do, not use Facebook? I mean, like, is that like a real option? Like what is the alternative if you want to keep in touch with your neighbors and college classmates?
Meth accounts for a large number of the drug-involved deaths in states west of the Mississippi, according to government data from 2017, while fentanyl is a major killer in the East and Midwest. Cocaine ranks third overall across the country for drug-related deaths.
A senior White House official told me, You have to work every day at all the details, grind the stuff out, persuade, cajole and force everyone to get on the same page. The federal government has amazing people working within it — FEMA, for example, has some real miracle workers — but they have to be led and managed. It can be done. The answer is not that a consulting group can do this better. For people like us who believe in government, task number one is to make government work.
Democrats have rightfully protested these scare tactics — but now they're doing the same thing.
With phrases such as only take from the USA and our farmers, Trump appears to suggest Puerto Ricans are not full U.S. citizens. They are citizens, though they generally do not pay federal income tax unless they work for the federal government; they pay other federal taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare.
SCOTUS GOES FOR OBAMACARE TRILOGY: The Supreme Court said it will review the latest Republican efforts to doom the Affordable Care Act, guaranteeing that partisan battles over health care will remain at the forefront of public debate in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, our colleague Robert Barnes reports.
If I had insurance, I could get [the tumor] removed and be done with it, he said.
The Senate, which did not face voters last year, remained opposed during the session. Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (R-Augusta), who has supported expansion for years, was the only Republican in that chamber to favor it — and even he wanted substantial changes to the House plan.
-- Meanwhile, Special Operations forces are stretched dangerously thin as the president's interference in Gallagher's case and two others comes with a cost to military ethics and discipline, writes columnist David Ignatius. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) took an important step Tuesday to protect the integrity of its forces with the release of a comprehensive review of the 'culture and ethics' of these elite units. ... But the thrust of the report is clear: Special Operations forces (SOF) are badly frayed by nearly 20 years of war.
The most interesting part of this piece is the revelation that Mueller wants to write a report on this, tweeted Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent who now teaches national security law at Yale. Let's say that his obstruction report details evidence he has gathered and he recommends that charges SHOULD be filed against the President. At that point, Rosenstein can either approve that request/recommendation, or decline it. It's likely that, since current DOJ policy is that a sitting President should not (or would not) be charged, Rosenstein would decline it. HOWEVER, here is the kicker: Under the special counsel [regulations], if Rosenstein *declines* a recommendation of [Mueller], he must then turn around and report this decision — and his reasons why — to the chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary committees and the ranking members of those committees. … It ensures that what the [special counsel] found, if it merits charges, will see sunlight. … And part of the reason for requiring it to go to the ranking members is to make sure the controlling party can't bury it either.
-- Michael Flynn's former business partner, Bijan Kian, has come under increased scrutiny as the Russia investigations continue to probe his lobbying work. Reuters' Nathan Layne and Julia Edwards Ainsley report: Investigators are also looking at whether payments from foreign clients to Flynn and his company, the now-inactive Flynn Intel Group, were lawful, according to two separate sources with knowledge of the broad inquiry into Flynn's business activities. That includes payments by three Russian companies and a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, controlled by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin … Kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the Inovo contract, two people with knowledge of that project said. It is not clear whether Kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how Flynn's company operated.
TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.
— Health care startup Oscar Insurance Corp. said it plans to expand in Arizona and at least three other new markets next year, a signal that it believes the Affordable Care Act will survive despite uncertainty over the law. We feel comfortable that the risk pool will remain comfortable, and that we can roll out the blueprint for expansion that we have in more areas, chief executive Mario Schlosser told Bloomberg News's Zachary Tracer.

In a statement, the National Safety Council pointed specifically to the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, saying the nation's opioid crisis is fueling the Council's grim probabilities, and that crisis is worsening with an influx of illicit fentanyl.
All in all, Democrats come to the spending negotiations from a strong position, lobbyists and staffers seem to think. After all, Republicans have already shown many of their cards by indicating they don't want a government shutdown.
The release of the tax plan Friday caps a three-week string of agenda-related events. The propals does not include enough detail about the proposed cuts and changes to deductions to contain an official estimate from congressional scorekeepers of how it would impact the federal deficit.

To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.
The reality is more nuanced and complicated, as is often the case in Washington policy debates. Despite Ryan's tweet that people with preexisting conditions are protected, there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law. The impact of recent tweaks to the proposed legislation is especially unclear because lawmakers are rushing ahead without an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. So here's The Fact Checker's guide to the debate.
Issa's longtime former spokesman decried the Ryan plan last night:
The legislation will also roll back guidance Democrats have said could undermine people with preexisting medical conditions by expanding the waivers states can get to run their marketplaces in alternative ways. Democrats have been particularly eager to keep talking about preexisting condition protections, after making it a top issue in the midterm elections helped them seize the House majority.

Spurned by Pompeo, the stop-Kobach movement is likely to summon lobbyist Matt Schlapp of Wichita to the rescue. The chairman of the American Conservative Union and a frequent face on Fox News, Schlapp can expect support from his former employers at Koch Industries. On the other hand, he's a rookie.

Rounds said he wants to create a fixed ratio between the least expensive plan and the most expensive plan that each company offers in a given state, though he did not offer details on how this goal would be achieved.
McCain, in turn, pulled no punches in criticizing the president on foreign policy and other issues, including in a stinging denunciation of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin in Helsinki in July.
Demographics are key: While Trump pulled just 48 percent in the district last November, Mitt Romney got 61 percent in 2012. That swing, one of the biggest in the country, is why Democrats aggressively targeted the race early on.
Meanwhile, Trump shows no signs that he will launch a rally tour to push the issue or make a daily clamor for various policy planks on health care, as Obama did in 2009 and Clinton did in 1993 and 1994. His rallies, when they have happened, have remained rambling Trump spectacles with no focused message.
Georgia election observers looked forward to tonight's resolution:
The annual National March for Life will be held in Washington on Friday.
It is hard not to notice a fundamental difference between the arguments being offered by Trump, on the one hand, and the bill's critics, on the other. Trump's case for the bill is extremely thin on substance. Trump claims Republicans should support the bill because the ACA is supposedly a disaster, but this argument is bolstered by a whole lot of lies. Trump also claims Republicans should make good on their promises to repeal and replace the ACA and that voters will supposedly punish them if they don't, neither of which are substantive cases for the GOP bill.
-- Hamas closed its only civilian border crossing with Israel Sunday amid rising tensions after the mysterious killing of a senior Hamas operative, who was shot in the garage of his home. Hamas has accused Israel of being behind the killing of the officer, who served nine years in an Israeli prison for his part in planning suicide bombings that killed dozens of Israeli civilians. Tensions have quickly ricocheted to their highest levels since 2014. (Ruth Eglash and Hazem Balousha)
He challenged you to answer with substance, not insults. How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?
But Republican leaders are putting increasing pressure on the rank and file to swiftly rally behind the bill this week. President Trump called Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Monday to discuss his concerns with the bill, according to Paul spokesman Sergio Gor.
We don't know the make-up of the CEA's index, though a White House official in response to our queries sent a list of post-tax profit margins for Cigna, United Health Group, Aetna, Anthem and Humana. But these companies have largely abandoned the ACA exchanges, with Aetna, Humana and United Health completely out.
Initially I was like, oh, this guy's garbage, because 'blue' people are garbage to me, Raimey said, standing in one of the quieter rooms of the home where Yang was about to give a talk. (By blue, he meant Democrats.) But I hear him and I think: Oh, that makes sense. And that makes sense. And that makes sense, too. He's not anti-capitalist, saying the whole world is against you.
But that 7 million figure also includes people who have other forms of health insurance (for example, Medicaid or through their employer) and therefore are already not eligible to receive a premium tax credit — regardless of whether they're eligible for VA health care.
That's what happened in 1946. Government-imposed rationing suppressed consumer demand during World War II while incomes went up, resulting in huge savings rates. Consumers splurged when the war ended, creating a sudden economic tsunami that dramatically increased inflation to an annual rate of nearly 15 percent by Election Day. The ruling Democrats were punished for this, with Republicans gaining 54 seats in the House and 12 seats in the Senate (11 from Democrats and one from the Progressive Party) to regain control of both chambers for the first time since 1930. As a Republican, I wouldn't mind this outcome. As an American, I'd prefer not to experience similarly high inflation and economic turmoil.
The slow pace of vaccinations has sparked a heated debate over how to stretch supplies.
The White House last week resorted to threats against Democrats and members of its own party in an effort to push members to the negotiating table on repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with the American Health Care Act, a Republican alternative championed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) but beleaguered by opposition from conservative groups.
Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests.
1 p.m.: Barr says he would not carry out order to fire Mueller, absent good cause
The World Health Organization recently named 'vaccine hesitancy' as one of the biggest global health threats of 2019, our Post colleague Taylor Telford reports. But on Facebook, in public pages and private groups with tens of thousands of members, false information about vaccines — largely stemming from a now-debunked 1998 study that tied immunizations to autism — is rampant and tough to pin down.
The administration is likely to face resistance from the opposition party in making those changes. After House Democrats met behind closed doors Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill to formulate a health-care strategy, key members said they were focused on blocking any steps the administration might take to weaken the law while continuing to blame its shortcomings on Democrats.
The police only went in when the mosque or imam asked us to go in.
Watch Jim squeeze the giant snake!
He definitely has to watch his right flank. He's always had to, said Schickel, who recently penned an opinion piece describing 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers, which was agreed to by McConnell's Senate, as another step toward socialism.
So now he's nominated someone entirely different. Moore looks like a lightweight who won't ever oppose anything that Trump will ever want. If Moore is confirmed, it will cast serious doubt on the Fed's ability to remain independent, which it needs to be to do its job properly. But it would be a big win for Trump, whose influence over the Fed would be increased.
Under the regulations, there is the possibility of that, but this committee would be aware of it, Barr said. A lot of water has gone under the dam since Elliot Richardson.
AHH: The Trump administration may have separated thousands more migrant children from their parents than was previously made public, according to a report released by HHS's inspector general.
Rep. Jake LaTurner (R-Kan.) disclosed Thursday that he had received a positive coronavirus test but a spokesperson said that he was not in the lockdown area in question. Separately, Rep. Charles J. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) said on Sunday that he tested positive for the virus after coming into contact with another infected member of Congress with whom he shares a residence. Fleischmann also said that he was not in the lockdown area on Wednesday.
The ad then cuts to an ordinary voter on the street saying, saying, I didn't know that. And a second one who says, That couldn't be right. And a third who asks quizzically, What politician would vote for that?

Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: It's the Americans.
After moderates consolidated behind the former vice president, Sanders finds himself back in the role of underdog, just as he was against Hillary Clinton at this moment four years ago. Last week, he seemed poised – and pleased – to avoid this position. But Biden won 10 of the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday, forging the kind of broad coalition that could win the nomination and presidency. Then former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg dropped out on Wednesday and endorsed the former vice president after his $600 million bet failed to pay off. With California still tallying results, Biden has 433 delegates to Sanders's 388.
The only candidate who regularly goes out of his way to applaud the ACA's progress has been Joe Biden, who served as vice president when it was passed and once famously told Obama it was a big, f---ing deal.
The House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Investment holds a joint field hearing on Protecting Those Who Protect Us: Ensuring the Success of our Student Veterans on Wednesday.
Trump goes back and forth on whether special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's nearly 400-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by the president should be released to the public.
Political control R Trump R Senate House (changed control) Why it happened Trump wanted funding for the border wall, but Democrats, who took control of the House during the shutdown, wanted to fund the government temporarily with no strings attached. How it was resolved Congress passed a three-week continuing resolution to reopen the government while debate on a border wall continued.
-- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has asked the White House to lift Obama-era restrictions on U.S. military support for Persian Gulf states engaged in a protracted civil war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan report: In a memo this month to national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Mattis said that 'limited support' for Yemen operations being conducted by Saudi Arabia and the UAE — including a planned Emirati offensive to retake a key Red Sea port — would help combat a 'common threat.' Approval of the request would mark a significant policy shift[:] U.S. military activity in Yemen until now has been confined mainly to counterterrorism operations against al-Qaeda's affiliate there … It would also be a clear signal of the administration's intention to move more aggressively against Iran. The Trump White House, in far stronger terms than its predecessor, has echoed Saudi and Emirati charges that Iran is training, arming and directing the Shiite Houthis in a proxy war to increase its regional clout against the Gulf's Sunni monarchies...
Gillibrand: I will take on the fight that no one else will.
-- Glory, one of two eaglets born at the National Arboretum this year, took his first flight yesterday, Martin Weil reports.
According to insiders to the transition, the shifts in the agenda primarily reflect the views of people chosen to help handle his ascension to the Oval Office, not a deliberate strategy by Trump to align with the GOP majorities in the House and Senate.
Price and Short both argued in television appearances Sunday that President Trump doesn't actually endorse the staggered approach. They said Trump was working the phones this weekend to urge senators to get on board with the Senate bill.
But in the past week you've mocked Mr. Trump's tan. You've made fun of his spelling. You called him a con artist. You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other vulgar jokes and jabs. So what happened?
Gorsuch has not ruled on the topic of abortion. But activists on both sides of the issue believe they know where he stands.
Late last month, for example, Trump overruled several top advisers when he directed the Justice Department to sign onto a lawsuit aimed at throwing out the health-care law known as Obamacare, declaring that Republicans would write their own replacement.
1. Obamacare is more popular than ever
How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.
There is no question, none whatsoever, that Bill is well-qualified to serve as attorney general, said Hatch, who once led the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Of course, if much of the vote is locked down in those first five states, and Clinton is up, Trump won't have a path. But we don't know whether that's the case yet.
RUBIO: ... A third of the people (INAUDIBLE)...
Former president Barack Obama said he worries progressives could potentially undermine Democratic allies
At the time, one particular Republican objected loudly and publicly. But he was nobody important — just the host of The Celebrity Apprentice.
-- A super PAC aligned with the Democratic establishment is launching a $680,000 ad buy to attack Bernie Sanders during the final five days before the caucuses. Among other hits, the commercial highlights his heart attack. From the Times: While Democratic Majority for Israel is focused on raising support for Israel within the party, its spot targets the dominant concern among many Democrats in Iowa and elsewhere: beating [Trump]. Featuring six Iowa voters, the ad argues that Mr. Sanders would be unable to defeat Mr. Trump in the November general election, citing the senator's heart attack last year and his left-wing ideology as evidence that he would be too risky ... The group made its ad reservations on Monday, booking ... a significant level of saturation over a short span ... The buy is heavily weighted toward Cedar Rapids and Des Moines markets, and the group is also airing the ad on cable, including on CNN, MSNBC and ESPN.
-- The Secret Service is investigating yet another incident at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. From the Miami Herald: Palm Beach police say they are conducting an 'open and active criminal investigation' at the club. …The Secret Service is leading the investigation and no arrest has been made, according to the Palm Beach Police Department. 'During an encounter with local law enforcement, an individual made non-threatening statements about a person under Secret Service protection,' a law enforcement official with knowledge of the incident told the Miami Herald. 'As part of standard practice, Palm Beach police contacted the local Secret Service office.'
On May 16, Trump announces that he will not run.
The president is carrying about 88, 90 percent of the Republican base, Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said Wednesday, two days after issuing a statement opposing refundable tax credits. Our voters said, 'Let's go and move,' and that's a factor.
He also said it was ludicrous that he was auditioning for the attorney general post through his comments, saying: If I wanted the job, and I was going after the job, there are more direct ways to bringing myself to the president's attention.
But the Democratic fight for the nomination to replace Mikulski was the marquee event of Tuesday's primary elections. The race was close and contentious for months, as two 57-year-old members of Congress sacrificed safe seats to reach for the Senate and stake a claim to the progressive vote in the heavily Democratic state.
So, do you buy Romney's blueprint, and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention?
RUBIO: ... That outline what the conservative movement has been about. And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.
We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
Some tweets from the Energy and Commerce hearing. Via the Hill's Peter Sullivan:
— House lawmakers are planning to introduce a bipartisan gun-control measure on Tuesday, an effort led by Pelosi, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).
That said, restoring earmarks right now — in an election year in which the GOP for now appears headed toward possibly losing control of both chambers of Congress — is a risky bet. Given the connotations that earmarks carry, it's not difficult to see Democrats saying that restoring them represents Republicans violating Trump's drain the swamp promises and restoring corruption to Washington. The same could hold true for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. It's also not difficult to see safe Republicans, who are wary of drawing primary challengers, shying away from supporting such an effort. It wasn't that long ago, after all, that the tea party struck fear in the hearts of dozens of GOP lawmakers and even unseated a few of them.
This is one of the reasons Republicans are willing to use the nuclear option, changing the rules of the Senate, to get him confirmed with fewer than 60 votes. They are confident he will facilitate a major rollback of the regulatory state over the next 30 to 40 years, which would be a major part of Trump's legacy as president.
This is the latest of several polls that's found that version of the proposal becoming unpopular, albeit more popular than much of what Republicans proposed in 2017. What sells: The Medicare for America plan backed by most House Democrats, which would simply let every American who wanted Medicare buy into it.
Major patient groups representing people with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease and multiple sclerosis, said in a joint statement that striking down these provisions would be catastrophic and have dire consequences for many patients with serious illnesses.
Biden, for his part, touts ACA's success in increasing coverage and has promised to add a government-run public option that Americans could sign up for if they want.
In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking. It's very easy to say, Let's cut waste, fraud, and abuse. I've rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut.
Trump, who sees his election as part of a global movement that includes Britain's decision to leave the European Union, wanted his speech to resonate beyond the country's borders. He said at the outset that he was addressing fellow Americans and people of the world.
OOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.
The Post tracked nearly 30 false or misleading claims Trump made during his Duluth rally:
The Biden guessing game is, as the man might say, no joke — the reason some confidants have been wrong about his start date is that he really does keep studying the field and changing his mind.

An in-depth look at the work the luckless Ohio Democrats are doing to get voters back on the rolls ahead of 2020. The same problem faces Democrats in a number of swing states.
We designed a national survey to measure extremely hostile partisan attitudes, both toward opponents and toward politicians in one's own party who buck the party's agenda — like McCain.
OUCH: Fewer workers in the United States tested positive for prescription painkillers last year, but more tested positive for cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. That's according to new data from Quest Diagnostics, one of the largest drug-testing labs in the country, the Wall Street Journal's Lauren Weber reports.
Pompeo said the vast majority of groups partnering with the United states comply with the so-called Mexico City policy, Politico's Nahal Toosi and Dan Diamond report.
— Google has launched a new tool to try to combat the nation's ongoing opioid crisis by helping people locate where they can throw away unwanted medications.
Republicans are howling that using the budget rules — get used to hearing the word reconciliation a lot in the coming weeks — would violate the calls for unity that Biden made in his inaugural address.
Yet most prognosticators say McConnell's chances of winning reelection are strong, and even Democrats acknowledge that the comparison to Bevin has serious limitations.
-- Some NATO troops are beginning to leave Iraq. From the New York Times: NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State. … The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced on Monday that the training had been temporarily suspended.
Yesterday, parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that a provision allowing the federal government to subsidize COBRA premiums at 85 percent is eligible for the simple-majority process Democrats are using to push the measure through without any GOP votes.
Even Federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. In 2013, years after he spoke at the founding Federalist Society symposium, and after he won Bush v. Gore, Ted Olson returned to the Supreme Court to overturn a California proposition banning same-sex marriage. For their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the Constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. Still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: Despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the Supreme Court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine, wrote recently in Slate.
The party of the vice president, who acts as president of the Senate and breaks ties when they occur. That will be the Democratic Party after Biden is inaugurated as president and Kamala Harris becomes vice president. Her tie-breaking vote assures the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, will become majority leader. (The Senate technically has 48 Democrats and two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who reliably vote with them.)
Isakson said in his comments Wednesday afternoon that he hoped his decision to speak out would tempt other Republicans to do the same. I'm not a big word-user, but I am on this, he said.
CRUZ: But what would you say...
-- A longtime top aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was accused of mishandling a sexual harassment investigation, is leaving her office. Deputy chief of staff Anne Bradley was expected to retire later this year but pushed up her departure amid reports that a young female staffer quit Gillibrand's office in protest of the investigation that Bradley helped lead. The woman had accused Gillibrand's longtime driver, Abbas Malik, of sexual harassment, but Malik was not fired until after the recent reports on the matter started surfacing. (Politico)
The first female GOP senator elected to leadership, Ernst recently announced a paid family leave proposal introduced with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would draw from an individual's Social Security funds. Ernst said that Ivanka Trump's involvement in the issue, along with Trump's State of the Union mention and commitment in the budget bode well for the chances of getting something done on the issue.
Authorities have been going after so-called 'pill mills' for years, but the new approach brings additional federal resources to bear against the escalating epidemic, she continues. Where prosecutors would spend months or longer building a case by relying on erratic informants and only limited data, the number-crunching by analysts in Washington provides information they say lets them quickly zero in on a region's top opioid prescribers.
And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
-- Seventeen states and the District sued the Trump administration to block a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. Tara Bahrampour reports: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, also includes six cities and the bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors and comes a week after California sued the administration over the same issue. … The suit names the Census Bureau and its acting director as well as the [Commerce Department], which oversees it, and [Commerce Secretary Wilbur] Ross. In announcing it, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman accused the administration of being 'out to destroy' the constitutionally mandated count. He said it would depress turnout in immigrant-heavy states and mocked [Jeff Sessions] for saying the question was necessary to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act, noting that Sessions has called the act 'an intrusive piece of legislation.'
— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.
The committee's top Republican, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), told me yesterday to expect House votes on many of these individual bills, but also some kind of larger, streamlined package on which he hopes the Senate might act (although the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has passed its own bundle of bills already, which is more likely to advance in that chamber).
I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.
— During a hearing before a Senate appropriations subcommittee, the outgoing Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he wants drug manufacturers to develop pain treatments that could replace older opioids.
We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.
Secretary Azar is here, and I want to thank him for this, but we had for the first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years, Trump declared to a room of reporters, taking a victory lap after he was acquitted of impeachment charges.
Given that, it's literally impossible for Trump to say or do anything related to the Clintons that would send Republican voters scurrying from him. In fact, what Trump is doing -- an aggressive airing of the Clintons' dirty laundry -- is exactly what many Republicans have been wishing their leaders would do for a long time. Taking it to the Clintons -- using any means necessary -- is a total winner for Trump with a fragmented GOP base.
And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.
Ultimately, of course, to the distress of most Federalists, the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012. Yet to Barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. Instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, Chief Justice Roberts found other grounds to support the law.
It's clear that Trump blames McCain for his party's failure to repeal Obamacare — or at least sees him as a reliable scapegoat. Trump has brought it up three times in the past four days alone, as he ramps up his campaigning ahead of November's midterm elections.
But even if association health plans ultimately prove successful — and it's too early to say for sure — Republicans face a harsh reality on health-care policy. After years of slamming the ACA but failing to come up with a viable alternative, they're now stuck in a defensive posture as energized Democrats leveraged the issue to their favor in 2018 and seek to do the same in 2020.
The House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee holds a hearing on the Trump administration's family separation policy on Thursday.
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.
A town hall turned hot last month in Texas when Rep. Joe Barton (R) said he opposed federal legislation protecting women from violence because it is a state issue.
We do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, Boonstra said.
The House passed its budget on a 68-to-32 vote, with 19 Republicans joining all 49 House Democrats in support.
TRUMP: Oh, give me a break... KELLy: ... This is what the Court of Appeals said.
The biggest unfinished task is Obamacare, Cruz told the Examiner. We need to finish the job. I still believe it is possible to bring Republicans together. I think we got very close last time and that's something I'm continuing to devote a lot of time trying to unite our fractious conference and build consensus to get at least 50 Republicans on the same page.
McConnell's announcement appeared designed to give Republicans time to move to other matters, such as raising the federal debt ceiling, after dispatching with a health-care vote.
Our systems are barely keeping up with the overwhelming volume, said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D), whose state has advertised jobs recently seeking people proficient in old programming languages.
With no real contest, the outlet's Byron York wrote on Twitter, a show of Trump organizational strength.
While congressional Republicans back the idea of the administration taking executive action to scale back the individual mandate, Democrats were quick to criticize it.
The subsidies would also mirror the ACA in that they would be pegged to a benchmark insurance plan each year, ensuring that the assistance grows enough to keep coverage affordable for customers.
After reading the letter, she tossed it aside:
The incident happened on May 8, four days after House Republicans narrowly passed a bill to overhaul the country's health-care system.
Harris said it was not a matter of ideas but political will. If Congress doesn't act to tighten guns laws, she said, she would take executive action as president to do so.
This is Bloomberg's stock response to questions about his stop-and-frisk record. His claim that he cut 95 percent of stop-and-frisk actions, which disproportionately targeted black and Hispanic men in New York while he was mayor, relies on a selective parsing of the data.
Booker pushed Barr to explain why he had continued to argue against bipartisan legislation to reduce sentences for drug crimes as late as 2016. Barr argued that when you have violent gangs . . . sometimes the most readily provable charge is the drug trafficking and that by charging individuals with drug offenses, you can be taking out a lot of violent offenders.
The two companies developed the drug together and will split the settlement payment, the Wall Street Journal's Sara Randazzo reports.
Henricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican.
Jesse Zhang is an illustrator in Brooklyn. She works in watercolor, ink and digital art.
Law exists, in part, to direct the natural urge for self-preservation and self-defense into peaceful channels. The Constitution exists to provide the law that governs those who govern us. And the judiciary was created, in part, to hold the government within its just powers and, by so doing, avoid the Hobbesian war of all against all.
And they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.
Graham used his opening questions to resurrect accusations that bias in the Justice Department and the FBI affected federal law enforcement agencies' scrutiny of Trump — and challenge the nominee to agree that they were troubling.
There was Eric, who had robbed a bank and served jail time. He was struggling and considering another robbery. Don't do that, she told him. Because obviously you're not very good at it.

A chorus of liberals attacked King--
Yesterday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee blasted out its latest news release on what it's terming sabotage by Republicans on health care. And Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) took to the Senate floor to rail against how Republicans have been approaching ACA coverage.
That's one of the differences that Joe and I have in our record, Sanders said. While Biden supported the war in Iraq, he said, I helped lead the opposition.
Expanded coronavirus testing may overwhelm lab capacity, experts say.
TRUMP: ... Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.
The 2020 presidential candidates may be more liberal, she allowed, but in our caucus we've always been progressive.
Senator Rubio, you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he's really been, in your words, sticking it to the American workers for 40 years. But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people. Question. How many jobs have you created?
It is worth taking stock of this moment. What we are seeing here is the marking of a willful GOP capitulation to Obamacare, Aaron writes. They are trying to dress it up and put a good face on it for Trump, given that he apparently is not willing to concede the point. But it appears their long-emphasized push to get rid of this allegedly destructive law is effectively over.
The rush to immediately chip away at Obama's regulatory and domestic policies through the complex process known as budget reconciliation could create months of messy GOP infighting. The plan to vote now on repeal and work out the details later means Republican leaders will be slogging through the difficult process of writing a health-care replacement while simultaneously trying to scale back regulations in areas such as clean air and immigration, and possibly tackling a tax-code overhaul. It will be the first real test of how effective the GOP-controlled Congress will be.
There are now more than 100 coronavirus case nationwide: We know there will be more cases, Vice President Pence said at a White House news conference. Now we're focused on mitigation of the spread as well as treatment of people that are affected.
In the years since the GOP tried and failed (and tried, and failed) to repeal Obamacare legislatively, Republicans continued a sort of backdoor sabotage of the law.
He denounced two controversial measures in New York and Virginia making it easier to obtain a late-term abortion. The Virginia measure, which has been tabled, would have allowed a single doctor to sign off on a third-trimester abortion instead of the three currently required and would have removed language requiring the danger to the mother be substantial and irremediable. The new law in New York allows women to now get late-term abortions if their health — not only their life — is threatened.
That bill repealed key components of the Affordable Care Act, including its insurance exchanges, individual mandate and medical device tax, and phased out the law's Medicaid expansion.
And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.
Endorse the Fairness for All Act, Mr. President. It's exactly the kind of win-win, bipartisan, creative initiative you're looking for.
If coverage is available for the cost of the fee plus any federal assistance for which the individual qualifies, the state would enroll that person in the plan at no additional cost.
Make medical marijuana widely available to patients and allow states to decide if they want to fully legalize pot. (Marijuana legalization has continued apace, although Trump hasn't pushed federal action on the medical front.)
There are also lots of reasons an Obamacare repeal failed; McCain's opposition was just one of them. He wasn't the only Senate Republican to vote against it, but his no was the most surprising and dramatic. His thumbs down on the floor of the Senate toward the end of a late-night vote elicited gasps among those present.
She supported Clinton because there were only two people on the ballot, and Clinton was just less silly.
They're eager for more such announcements — perhaps during today's protest — from the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency is expected to soon release a final regulation strengthening enforcement of 25 existing health-related religious freedom laws and another rule banning abortions from being provided at the same location where Title X family planning services are offered.
It would create at least $131.8 billion combined in federal tax revenue between 2017 and 2025.
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to detail the strategy, described a largely conventional media approach — albeit one shaped by pandemic-imposed restrictions. It blends high-profile interviews, like Biden's exchange with CBS before the Super Bowl, with outreach to specialized publications like Parents Magazine, as well as Spanish-language outlets, and extensive local-media courtship.
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense holds a hearing on Defense health programs on Wednesday.
Learning to recite poetry by W.B. Yeats helped Biden overcome his stutter. I used to stutter so badly. At night, my uncle and I would stand in front of the mirror and read Yeats, and I would practice and practice to breath and to get it down.

Even in states that have tried to reject the ACA wherever possible, the law has had a marked impact. Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia — which are among the 14 states that still refuse to expand Medicaid — have the most marketplace enrollees, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
After House passage, McCarthy and dozens of Republicans joined President Trump at a White House celebration.
If your wages and compensation stay essentially the same, but then I jack up the price of college every year and I jack up the price of your health insurance every year, then you become increasingly unhappy and miserable. That's what's happening with the American people right now. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)
All these parties are paying close attention to what Trump will say because they play crucial roles in how the prices of drugs are set in the United States, which has a more complicated drug supply chain than in many other developed nations.
On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect.
Bloomberg is alienating all three groups.
The chaplain will lead us in prayer.
-- Sanders takes the 11th-hour attack seriously enough that he tweeted a straight-to-camera response: The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should, he said. Under our administration, the wealthy and the powerful will begin paying their fair share in taxes. ... The big-money interests can run all the negative ads they want, but it's not going to work.
Blumenthal also asked Barr to explain whether his past opposition to Roe v. Wade would affect how he would defend it as attorney general. Barr said the law was established precedent, adding that he would absolutely defend the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act as well.
Bloomberg said he was there both times when the question was his support for Obama, but the mayor did not endorse anyone for president in 2008 and called his 2012 endorsement of Obama backhanded. His claim of a 95 percent reduction in stop-and-frisk actions relies on cherry-picked statistics and obscures a sharp increase in these tactics in 2011. Bloomberg's comments about Muslim surveillance, Obamacare and prior releases of his tax returns all revise history in some way.
Lines stretched around the block and opening hours were extended for a weekend-long Comedy Central exhibit of President Trump's tweets. (Reuters)
House Republicans passed the bill, but the Democratic-controlled Senate blocked the measure.
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are on the trip, and they posted shots from the Taj Mahal:
* States could cut more people from Medicaid coverage, or reduce the range of services covered, which will only send more poor people to hospital emergency rooms for free medical care, resulting in still more cost shifting.
-- The Trump administration is inviting states to convert part of Medicaid into a block grant, a conservative goal Congress rejected more than two years ago. Amy Goldstein reports: A letter to every state Medicaid director, to be dispatched Thursday, will offer the possibility of trading away an entitlement program that expands and contracts depending on how many poor people need the government health coverage. In exchange, for able-bodied adults in the program, states could apply to receive a fixed federal payment and freedom from many of the program's rules, according to several individuals familiar with the plans. … Proponents and critics alike expect the block grant guidance will also face court challenges. … Allowing block grants in Medicaid has been a prime objective for [administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema] Verma since she arrived in Washington three years ago from a role as an Indiana-based health-care consultant whose clients included several states' Medicaid programs. Within the administration, Verma has consistently argued for states to be allowed greater flexibility in running Medicaid, which is a joint responsibility of the federal government and the states.
The Trump administration has proposed overhauling the current rebate system by banning these discounts and pushing drug companies to pass the discounts directly to the patient.
Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.
RUBIO: ... This isn't just about flexibility.
Mulvaney said, we'll try and fix it by ourselves, saying on ABC's This Week that Democrats probably wouldn't help to fix the law should the courts strike it down.
Now the agency said 4 million fewer people would have insurance in the second year — not the 14 million from the estimate six months before. And the 10-year number was 13 million, not 23 million. (Note: the 23 million figure in May included the impact of a number of policy changes. A July report by the CBO more carefully defined the impact of individual mandate using the 2016 baseline: 15 million fewer insured in the second year, 16 million at the end of ten years.)
The key to beating Trump, he said, is to expose him for the fraud that he is.
-- After the U.S. shot down a Syrian government jet Sunday, Russia warned that further action would result in its military treating U.S. forces as targets. Louisa Loveluck and David Filipov report: Russia condemned that strike as a 'flagrant violation of international law' and said its forces will treat U.S.-led coalition aircraft and drones as targets if they are operating in Syrian airspace west of the Euphrates River while Russian aviation is on combat missions. Pavel Baev, who studies the Russian military at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, called the threat 'mostly a bluff' but said that 'calling it is risky because there are some nervous fingers on many buttons.' In a statement Monday, the [U.S.-backed fighters in Syria] warned that it would retaliate in the face of further aggression from pro-Assad forces, raising the possibility that the United States could be forced to deviate further from its stated policy in Syria, which involves targeting Islamic State militants only.
The Green New Deal is just one of several issues where candidates are describing one thing while activists are demanding another, even when using the same language.
Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.
The president's comments at the Senate lunch came after the Justice Department backed invalidating Obamacare in a legal filing Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans, where an appeal is pending in a case challenging the law's constitutionality. A federal judge in Texas ruled in December that the law's individual mandate can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress's tax power and further found that the remaining portions of the law are void. He based his judgment on changes to the nation's tax laws made by congressional Republicans in 2017.
It's about more than personalities, too. Democrats are divided about the best approach to governing. The CBS-YouGov poll published on Sunday, which had Biden up 5 points over Sanders, found that 54 percent of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina think the party should nominate someone who is trying to return the country to the way it was before Donald Trump took office, and 46 percent said Democrats should instead advance a more progressive agenda than the country had under Barack Obama.
Bill de Blasio. He has postponed a trip to New Hampshire, which was supposed to start tomorrow, after the shooting death of a police officer.
And because the Trump administration issued a public-health order effectively blocking migrants from crossing into the United States, Biden inherited an infrastructure ill-prepared to handle a big influx in the middle of the pandemic. Federal agents have taken into custody more than 70,000 migrants a month for each of the past four months, the most for that period in at least 10 years.
You might have been a little confused by my explanation above of the three different tallies. In fact, there's a good chance your eyes glazed over as you skimmed down for something more interesting and less arcane. Well, take comfort, dear reader: You aren't alone. The people at the caucus I attended in Norwalk, a suburb of Des Moines, were also a little unclear on how the thing worked.
When asked to define the jurisdiction of his committee, Mr. Dingell liked to point at a photograph of the Earth taken from space, Emma Brown recalls in The Post's obituary.

Even conservative legal scholars have criticized the administration for refusing to defend the ACA, and most Republicans view it as a political loser in 2020 by opening them up to more political attacks around protecting people with preexisting conditions.
So far, the administration has tried to project confidence and competence, one strategy to push back against criticism from Democrats.
AHH: The new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, defended the Trump administration's partial e-cigarette ban but also pledged to take tougher action as needed, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
Asked if the past two weeks have exacerbated that dynamic, Ayres said, I believe this falls in the realm of the obvious.
We're building an airplane while we're flying it, said state Sen. Mike McGuire (D), who represents the northern coastal region of California, where many marijuana farms are located.

—Cecile Richards, the Planned Parenthood president who is stepping down this spring, writes in a new memoir that Jared Kushner told her Planned Parenthood could get more federal funding if it agreed to stop providing abortions. The conversation occurred during a previously reported meeting last January between Richards, Kushner and Ivanka Trump. At the time, Republicans in Congress were determined to strip Planned Parenthood clinics of Medicaid funding as part of an Obamacare repeal bill.
But Scott let loose in a tweet Saturday: Mark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare.
In addition to Mueller-related questions, Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee are expected to dive into Barr's long record at the Justice Department. For example, they have privately told Barr to be prepared for questions about his record on the use of torture, executive power, women's reproductive rights and about his interest into opening a criminal inquiry in to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
For years, Washington has held both a caucus, paid for by the state party, and a later, nonbinding primary, concurrent with state primary elections. In the 2016 caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won 72.7 percent of the vote, giving him one of his biggest pledge delegate margins over Hillary Clinton. Months later, Clinton won 52.4 percent of the vote in the nonbinding primary, which neither candidate campaigned to win.
THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
— Following a reported meeting at the White House of top officials, which the president convened to discuss rising drug costs, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar wrote on Twitter that prices must start coming down.
-- A young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway, Anna Fifield reports from Beijing. Reports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies. Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of … when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could be spread. …The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was already entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Production companies have postponed the release of seven blockbuster films that were to be released over the holiday, leading Chinese cinema companies to close the country's 70,000 movie theaters. …
Hey, at least Trump isn't Hillary Clinton, I keep hearing from conservatives around town — something I rarely heard until this month.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the Trump administration's move to strike down Obamacare is a slap in the face:
Among the Republicans who early on recognized Biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are Utah's Mitt Romney, Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski.
Tabaddor described the partial shutdown as a tremendous disruption to cases in an already overburdened court.
* TRUMP'S ENVIRONMENTAL CUTS COULD HURT GOP DISTRICTS: A Bloomberg analysis concludes that Trump's proposed cuts to environmental spending could cut deeply into money that flows into GOP districts:
If you lost your job or were furloughed because of the coronavirus, or if the company you work for is permanently or temporarily shut down because of it, you qualify for weekly unemployment payments from the state in which you worked.
Americans are in desperate need of more affordable health insurance options, Verma said in a statement. We are looking for information and ideas from the public on how to create a more dynamic health insurance market with more insurers participating and competing to meet the needs of the American people just like we see in markets for so many other products and services that enhance our daily lives.
The pledged delegates: There will also be nearly 4,000 pledged delegates in Milwaukee. Technically speaking, these delegates are not bound to presidential candidates but they tend to represent the will of the voters in their state. That could change, however, after the first ballot.
This tired approach always fails. Free-market fundamentalists did nothing for decades to address the lack of health insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans. For them, all was well. But that didn't make the problem go away; all their denial and inaction did was give the left moral legitimacy to solve the problem. The result was Obamacare, which predictably extended government control and subsidies far beyond what a reasonable conservative approach would have been.
Trump began dismantling Obama's record, starting with reversing a recent mortgage insurance premium cut that had been projected to save some homeowners hundreds of dollars a year. Democrats denounced the action.
Additionally, Iowa, Kentucky and South Carolina moved to restrict family planning funding for abortion providers, making 15 states to try to cut these providers out of the federal Title X program. They've got strong support from Trump, who signed a bill last year reversing Obama-era guidance saying states couldn't restrict Title X funds in that way.
The Alzheimer's Association hosts an event this morning on dementia care practice recommendations, and will be joined by lawmakers including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.).
But it sidesteps the Republican leadership's role in backing what became known as the MacArthur Amendment and ultimately forcing a vote on a bill that faced uncertain prospects in the Senate and put scores of GOP lawmakers on the political defensive.
We're trying to point out the absurd today, Booker said after the CBO wouldn't share the bill with them. This is absolutely offensive.... It's an a-historical, a-democratic affront to the American public by not allowing them to be involved or engaged in the process.
Aaron in Titus Andronicus: Come, come, our Empress, with her sacred wit, to villainy and vengeance consecrate.
The quality of the coverage has gotten worse and worse, Robertson said. We're seeing a hollowing-out of insurance, even by the people who have it.
The Obama administration played an aggressive role behind the scenes in assisting marketplaces last year, as they were hit by a first wave of rate hikes and insurer exits. For awhile last August it appeared there would be no insurer at all in Pinal County, Ariz., for example, until officials convinced Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona to open its doors there.
The first two debates will take place over two nights each. Democrats announced this previously, but it's official: A June debate anchored by NBC News and a July debate anchored by CNN will unfold over consecutive prime time evenings, as a way of including more candidates without shunting any into little-watched undercard debates.
Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina and chairman of the Conservative Partnership Institute:
While the decision to forgo another whack at overhauling the law means the GOP will fail to fulfill a promise the party has made to voters for eight years, it also means they are now facing reality. And it underscores how Republicans overpromised in their ability to reform the nation's health care and never fully recognized how divided the party is over key Obamacare planks like protecting pre-existing conditions and preserving the law's Medicaid expansion, Burgess writes.
Ignore the spin. Here's what's actually in the funding bill:
The campaign apparently decided criticism from Thomas in the film was not a bad thing.
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion. So I said (ph), No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.
Hypocrisy, however, is not reason enough to dismiss the 10 senators' Republican alternative completely out of hand, at least as a starting point for negotiations.
Andrew Yang: So Amazon, the trillion-dollar tech company, pays zero in taxes, which sort of weakens this case that, hey, we'll get tax revenue and then make use of it. And the question is, even if the government did have revenue, what would it do for that woman to improve her lot? Right now, that's a very open question. What is the government doing about the fact that 30 percent of our country's stores in malls are closing for good? What is the government doing about the fact that robot trucks are just now starting to hit the highways and driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states? And the answer is the government is doing nothing because our government is decades behind the curve. Everyone knows that. They got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. So they've literally been flying blind on technology-related issues for 25 years and counting. The American people know this. So they look up and say, How are we going to actually solve these problems on the ground? That is the open question. That is why Donald Trump is our president today, is because Americans have been unsatisfied with the answer.
Okay, ma'am. I'm just going to search you right now, the security guard replied.

I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel's work, Barr said. For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.
(6) For all the talk of democracy's dysfunction the 2017 elections in Virginia showed how the system worked. Democrats ran on expanding Medicaid, voters overwhelmingly chose Democrats, and now Virginia voters got what they wanted. (By the way, it may surprise political watchers who focus solely on Washington to learn that a lot of state governments are responsive to and demonstrate bipartisan cooperation.)
To be sure, the final package strongly reflects traditional GOP priorities. Most significantly, the bill provides generous new tax credits to employers to offset the costs of providing mandatory sick leave, in lieu of Democrats' initial plan to mandate a new federal benefit. As political scientists Matt Grossman and David Hopkins remind us, that's a common pattern when the parties negotiate the details of major new programs.
This is about helping state departments of insurance do their job better, Michael Adelberg, a principal at Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, told me yesterday. You're letting them add tools to the toolbox.
Health 202: It's certainly something both parties are talking about.
I think you could never afford that. You're talking about trillions of dollars, Bloomberg said at the time.
The Republican nominee is saying that he will make it happen here. He tells Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, that if he were president, you'd be in jail. He nods approvingly and chimes in when his crowds chant, Lock her up. He warns that a vast if fuzzily defined conspiracy of global bankers, media companies and election officials is gearing up to steal the election. The election is rigged, he says. It's rigged like you have never seen before. They're rigging the system.
The hearing room was packed with attorneys, lobbyists and staffers for the pharmaceutical industry and lawyers for counties, towns and cities, many of which are involved in a massive, consolidated case in Cleveland where localities are going after the industry for the wreckage its products have caused in communities across the country.
— On Friday, Iowa's Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into a law a ban on most abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. The heartbeat bill, which prohibits abortions as early as six weeks, is one of the country's earliest-in-pregnancy bans on abortions and sets up for a legal showdown. This is bigger than just a law, this is about life, and I'm not going to back down, Reynolds said about the law on Friday, acknowledging it would likely face litigation, the AP's Barbara Rodriguez reports.
Biden advisers insisted to Memoli the former veep still hasn't made a decision about whether to run. But here are some proposals he's considering if he does:
The owner of the company became the de facto news director, said a former OAN producer who quit because the coverage of Trump had become too slanted. He has a ton of influence over every aspect of the newscast. He has stories written on his whim.
He also said last year was a record year for novel drug approvals, or approvals of drugs that have never been approved or marketed in the United States. Among the new drugs FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research approved were the first new treatment in more than a decade for pain associated with endometriosis and a new non-opioid drug meant to help opioid withdrawal symptoms, according to a report issued Monday by the agency.
The money could help navigators after the Biden administration ordered HealthCare.gov, the federal online insurance marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, to reopen for a special enrollment in an effort to bolster coverage during the pandemic. But some experts say that the additional money may not be enough.
And such changes are also looked on favorably by some House Republicans who don't expect their version of the American Health Care Act to survive the Senate.
The Obama administration had originally proposed a May 3 deadline for insurers to submit bids, but the Trump administration pushed that back to June 21. The bids won't be finalized until August or September, but they're initial indicators of the premium hikes – or decreases – insurers are envisioning for next year.
It was a play on Lyndon Johnson's 1964 slogan: All the way with LBJ.
He made a reference Tuesday to naming seven new inspectors general, a nod to the aggressive moves he has made in recent days to curb oversight and to push out government officials seen as insufficiently loyal.
The primary evidence? Comparing a value-weighted health insurance stock index created by CEA with the public indexes for the healthcare sector, the insurance sector and the Standard & Poors 500 Index. A chart in the report shows that the health-insurance index has soared above the others since the ACA was implemented in 2014.
Schultz, whose rollout has been light on policy substance, has said that a left-leaning Democratic nominee would create a path for him; more quietly, he has suggested that if someone not seen as left-wing wins the nomination, he has no path. The billionaire's veto, as some commentators have described it, could shape the incentives for Democrats even if Schultz does nothing.
OUCH: Here's a stunning story from the latest in Vox's series about emergency-room billing: A man was beaten unconscious, woke up in an emergency room, checked to determine the hospital was in his health plan's network, and still ended up with a more than $7,000 bill. I was on my iPhone lying there with a broken jaw, and I go on the Humana website and see the hospital listed, 34-year-old Scott Kohan told Sarah Kliff. So I figured, okay, I should be good.
The former commissioners argue that as part of the Health and Human Services department, the FDA is not fully able to serve its role to protect public health.
The drop in overdose deaths shows that the President's new level of focus on the opioid crisis, and the administration's science- and community-based efforts to combat it, are beginning to make a significant difference, Azar said in a statement.
There's actually evidence that marketplace plans are regaining some profitability. Their medical loss ratios, which is the share of premiums paid out as claims, have recently started to improve and their gross margins per member are also rising, according to an analysis last week from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
Trump stews endlessly about perceived slights, humiliations and losses, leading him to lash out wildly in all directions. And there is clear evidence that his impulsiveness can work against him. The White House's initial volley of insane attacks on the press — over its accurate reporting on his inaugural crowd size — showed how Trump's hallucinatory obsessiveness can end up steeling the media to hold him more accountable, not less. Trump's own tweets lashing out at the judiciary — as well as the reckless internal processes that seem to have taken hold at the White House, which ultimately reflect his own distracted state — may now be undermining his demand that the judiciary show him near-absolute deference on national security matters.
The GOP rift over funding to address the opioid crisis could imperil getting to the 50 necessary votes on health care, The New York Times's Robert Pear and Jennifer Steinhauer report. GOP Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) are lobbying for more funding and their votes seem like they'll be absolutely necessary for McConnell to get the bill over the finish line. Here's the calculus: Republican senators from states that have been hit hard by the opioid drug crisis have tried to cushion the Medicaid blow with a separate funding stream of $45 billion over 10 years for substance abuse treatment and prevention costs, now covered by the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But that, too, is running into opposition from conservatives. They have been tussling over the issue with moderate Republican senators like Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine. Without some opioid funding, Mr. Portman cannot vote for the bill, he said, adding, Any replacement is going to have to do something to address this opioid crisis that is gripping our country.

OOF: New York City is joining the growing list of cities and states suing drug companies over the opioid crisis. Yesterday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city has filed a lawsuit against Allergan, Endo International, Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharmaceutical, and distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, blaming them for contributing to the deadly nationwide opioid epidemic.
Actually, that's not hard to do given 62 percent of Americans disapprove of the Republicans' health-care plan, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. Just 6 percent strongly approve of the legislation.
OAN employees recounted receiving reprimands signed by Robert Herring or being called into his office to be dressed down for insubordination when they ran stories he disapproved of.
About a quarter of all workers — more than 30 million people — do not have access to paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many work low-wage jobs in restaurants and retail that involve constant contact with the public.
Cruz rightly realizes that this reputation is beneficial only up to a certain point in the primary campaign. Lately, Cruz has taken hits from Trump for being so unpopular in the Senate.
The market plunge yesterday underscored the coronavirus's political risk to Trump.
The poll also shows that a plurality of voters support the law Trump is seeking to strike down: Obamacare. Nearly half, 47 percent, approve of the law — more than the 41 percent who disapprove of it, Politico's Steve Shepard writes. The survey did not ask about a still-nonexistent Republican replacement for Obamacare, but it did find majority support for a Medicare-for-all health care system, in which all Americans would get their health insurance from the government. Fifty-two percent of voters support a Medicare-for-all system, while 35 percent oppose it.
Don't talk about institutions, and the checks and balances they create. Institutions are only as good as the people who serve them. Authoritarianism, American-style, can be averted only if people have the courage to stand against it … in the end, I fear, it's going to rest on the people — on whether enough Americans are willing to take a public stand. We can't handle another post-9/11-style suspension of doubt about the man in charge; if that happens, America as we know it will soon be gone.
Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, told CNBC the administration aimed to go after the flavors that are most popular with kids but the agency will revisit its policies if young people start to increasingly use menthol products.
Nevertheless, he said, If you are one of the people who . . . doesn't qualify for a tax credit, these premium increases do make insurance less affordable. He cast the idea of expanding subsidies as a way to smooth out the kinks in the law at a time when the ACA already has helped to drive down the ranks of the uninsured to about 10 percent of the U.S. population. I don't want anyone to be left out without health insurance, Obama said.
We started out with the premise of news straight down the middle, said Cassie Leuffen, an anchor at OAN from its birth through the 2016 election. But the bias does reveal itself in the story selection. The owner really felt this was what was needed. He saw the popularity of Trump before almost anybody, and Trump became our bread and butter.
The president also backed off his threat to shut down the border with Mexico, the latest of his many proposed schemes to stem the flow of tens of thousands of Central American migrants entering the United States each month.

The some-or-all approach required by reconciliation basically comes down to this reasoning: If a policy directly affects the nation's economic bottom line, you can use reconciliation to pass said policy with a simple majority. If a policy doesn't directly affect the nation's budget, you have to follow the regular rules for passing legislation.
Valde, a Democrat who said he will caucus for Hillary Clinton, said after the exchange that Cruz hadn't answered his question.
— Doctors, drug companies and the nation's top drug regulator are expressing concern that drugmakers who make the most advanced, costly, name-brand biologic drug therapies are spreading doubt about switching to generic versions of their medicines as a way to protect their profits. Those scare tactics come as even the FDA has said those unbranded versions are safe and effective, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.
In a 41-page report, Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote that while the bureau seemed to recognize its failings, it had 'not taken sufficient action' to fix the problems, Matt Zapotosky reports. Horowitz noted that in the more than 20 homegrown terrorist attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, several suspects had been previously assessed by the bureau as a potential threat but not fully investigated.

But in Florida it's an interesting phenomenon. We got huge enrollments because we have no big industries that can easily accommodate a large percentage of the population [with employer-sponsored coverage]. People said to me, 'You have all those enrollments in south Florida Cuban clinics.' You have a set of clinics basically with Latin American doctors in South Florida. Many of them Cuban. And you have hospitals that had large, large numbers of low-paying patients and everybody had an economic incentive to sign people up.
KELLY: ... Go ahead, Mr. Trump...
We should have that debate, because the fact is that the United States has never elected anyone as president who is as far left as Sanders. The only modern Democratic nominees approaching Sanders's ideological views were former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984 and then-Sen. George McGovern in 1972. Together, they won a scant 30 electoral college votes and lost the popular vote by a combined 35 million votes. Mondale's wipe-out was the biggest electoral college loss in U.S. history.
To make it to age 89.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) felt similarly in December when Congress passed a $1.4 trillion spending extravaganza, complete with half a trillion dollars in tax cuts and a bevy of favors for special interests — all without debate and without committee consideration, based on decisions made by the bill's sponsors over a weekend. The $300 billion Cadillac tax, a restraint on lavish employer-provided health plans, was repealed. This demonstrated that Congress cannot repeal Obamacare but will not pay for it. Amendments were not allowed, debate was limited to 90 minutes, and the Senate voted on the bill less than three days after it was unveiled. Senate leadership clearly didn't want it to be understood or discussed, Cassidy said.
Restore and protect the Florida Everglades, even though it's a rough-looking sight down there. (The most recent budget signed by Trump last month included a record amount for the Everglades.)
Trump likes to blame Democrats for holding up his agenda. But if he took away Democrats' ability to block his agenda, he would lose his favorite scapegoat.
AHH: An assault over tree limbs? Court documents reveal new details on the bizarre dispute between Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and the man who allegedly assaulted him at his Kentucky home in November. Paul's neighbor, Rene Boucher, was unhappy with a pile of tree limbs that Paul stacked near the line separating their properties, finding it unsightly, Roll Call reports. Boucher could see the pile from his back patio, though it was not on his property.
The variant is not thought to increase risk of severe illness or death and researchers believe existing vaccines will still work to prevent it. But the virus's genetic alterations appear to allow it to bind more easily with receptor cells in humans, increasing the viral load of people infected with it, which in turn may lead to greater transmission.
Because we are operating on the federal exchange, we are subject to the whims of the Trump administration and directly impacted by its efforts to damage and destabilize the market, said Marlene Caride, commissioner of the state's Department of Banking and Insurance, in a statement.
They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.
We cannot mess this up. And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done, that's not how you win. And the stakes are too high. (CROSSTALK)
It's a close race that shouldn't be close, Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who is working for GOP candidate Karen Handel, said of the June 20 election.
But here's what is fishy: Previous such reports, even ones issued earlier than June 12, included data through March 31. In virtually every state, people signing up for coverage between Jan. 15 and Jan. 31 do not even pay a first premium until March. Charles Gaba, who assiduously tracks Obamacare enrollment at ACASignups.net, estimates that leaves off about 500,000 people. Using enrollment as of Jan. 31 rather than enrollment through Jan. 15 also serves to inflate the purported decline.

Other possible candidates: state legislator Ritchie Torres, who had considered mounting a primary challenge to the aging congressman, and state legislator Michael Blake, who won Serrano's support in his 2019 bid for New York City public advocate. All three men have carried the territory that makes up the Bronx-based 15th District, but to be fair, any Democrat would: Hillary Clinton won 93.8 percent of its votes in 2016.
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) blocked an earlier GOP attempt to pass the legislation by unanimous consent, arguing that U.S. laws already prohibit infanticide. This latest effort will require 60 votes to hold a vote on the measure itself, making it unlikely Republicans will succeed in advancing it. House Democratic leaders have refused to bring a similar bill to the floor.
Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who has put forward a tax-deduction-based bill endorsed by the Freedom Caucus, acknowledged that it will be challenging if Trump supports tax credits.
It took off in the tea party era. There was Deneen Borelli's Blacklash: How Obama and the Left Are Driving Americans to the Government Plantation; Star Parker's Uncle Sam's Plantation: How Big Government Enslaves America's Poor and What We can Do About It; and the Rev. C.L. Bryant's film Runaway Slave. Back then, he told me, Government dependency is the plantation that Democrats support. Then-gadfly, now-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson referred to Obamacare as the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery — a related form of hyperbole meant to make a slightly different point.
The USDA, which administers the food stamp program, has declined to answer questions about its reserves and would not provide an estimate of when the program would run out of funding, Helena writes. In the omnibus spending package passed early last year, Congress gave USDA $3 billion for the reserve fund and provided a longer leash … Some experts believe USDA's food stamp cushion could be closer to $6 billion, which would cover February, though Congress would need to come up with money beyond that point. It's also possible the department has extra funds it can use.
McCain called Trump's comments at a joint news conference with Putin one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory, adding that Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin.
However, several voters who said they were Republicans cast their ballots for Lamb — and against the president.
Trump's attorneys filed a brief claiming that the Constitution doesn't permit a trial of a former president. They asked the Senate to dismiss the case, accusing Democrats of a hunger for this political theater, John Wagner and Paulina Firozi report.
President Trump continues to mangle his facts about the Affordable Care Act. As we have frequently noted, the ACA mostly affected the individual market, yet the president suggests he's talking about all health insurance. In the Obamacare markets, premiums have not spiked to unimaginable levels, 2 million people have not dropped out and insurance companies departing the business have cited the administration's own policies for creating uncertainty in the marketplace.
In 1998, Rep. Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM! (April 2 tweet)
* GET READY FOR THE BIG CBO SCORE: Margot Sanger-Katz previews what to look for: Will it increase the deficit? How many would be uninsured? And this:
Yesterday morning, top officials with Blue Cross Blue Shield Association — whose insurers have the strongest presence in the ACA marketplaces — told reporters that rate hikes in 2019 should be somewhat lower than in years past. Hours later, the Congressional Budget Office offered a similar analysis, projecting the average premium for a mid-level marketplace plan will increase by about 15 percent next year, compared to an average 34 percent increase this year. The CBO expects premiums for those covered by Obamacare to increase an average of 7 percent annually between 2019 and 2028.
For many former Republicans (or ones temporarily in exile) who lived through the total collapse of the Republicans in the Trump onslaught in 2016 — and warned Democrats not to repeat the error of the rival party — there was a mixture of delight, relief and amazement. Could it be that one party had collectively decided not to commit political suicide? Could it be that a party solved the conundrum in which the individual imperative to remain in the race leads to a collective failure (i.e. the inability to thwart a hostile takeover)?
Sanders did not mention Azar by name, but he noted that Trump's people have said they can't guarantee the vaccine's affordability, prompting boos from the crowd.
I just wonder if it's covered under Obamacare, quipped Spicer, Trump's first press secretary.
He added: The law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite them.
He added, If I'm a bottleneck, I'm happy I'm a bottleneck — getting a lot done.
5. What limits will Democrats face?
Barr committed to both Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) that he would support a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act — but acknowledged that he would need to get up to speed on the work the Justice Department does regarding it, as the office in question didn't exist, obviously, when he was there before.
In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law's marketplaces and through states' Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing universal access to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage.
Here are five of their stories.
In September, the Des Moines Register reported the party would, in fact, hold caucuses in Iowa this year. That announcement was necessary because in other states — South Carolina and Arizona — the state parties had decided to forgo any actual contest. While there were some announced challengers to the president, there were no formal Republican debates.
Tanden specifically praised Murkowski in another tweet before the vote. On @lisamurkowski, members of the GOP threatened her state and threatened her directly. I don't believe she will fold. Tanden was right about this, too.
Pass the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, which will reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four and lower income taxes for all. The highest earners would pay a 25 percent tax. Individuals earning less than $25,000 per year or couples earning less than $50,000 would not be charged income tax, although they would have to file a one-page form with the IRS that states: I win. (Trump's tax cuts passed, but there were still seven brackets, and the highest earners were at 37 percent. Many of those at the bottom still pay some and can't simply write, I win.)
Democrats won unified control of the federal government Wednesday, after two U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia were called in their favor just as a mob of rioters allied with President Trump invaded the Capitol building, destroying property, injuring police officers and disrupting the election certification process for President-elect Joe Biden, The Washington Post's Michael Scherer writes.
The relief the two felt soon gave way to nervousness as conservatives sharpened their attacks on the health law. In late 2015, a pro-ACA governor, Democrat Steve Beshear, left office and an anti-ACA governor, Republican Matt Bevin, succeeded him.
4) Keep looking to civil society and try to fortify it where possible. The Atlantic's Jonathan Rauch has a nice piece arguing that if Trump does continue shredding basic democratic and governing norms, civil society — a loosely knit coalition of legal and political groups, given ammunition by intense scrutiny from watchdogs and media outlets, and backed up by meaningful, sustained public mobilization — can have a real illuminating and constraining impact. As Brian Beutler notes, the early indications are actually somewhat positive: Our democratic and civil society institutions, however flawed and weakened, are still working.
If we don't have a proposal on health care, then that's a mistake going into 2020, Graham told reporters after Trump's visit to the Senate GOP luncheon.
-- China has put 1 million Muslims in concentration camps. MBS had nothing to say, by Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt: China is a leading oppressor of Muslims, so … Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman must have had a lot to say when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping late last week. Wait, what's that you say? The prince had nothing to say on behalf of China's Muslims? In fact, he defended what China calls an effort to fight extremism? Yes, that is in fact what happened. And the reason is simple: In return, China defended Saudi Arabia's right to orchestrate a murder and get away with it. Your concentration camps are your internal affair. My conspiracy to commit murder is my internal affair. How nice, we understand each other. It has been nearly five months since Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, murdered and dismembered. Little accountability has been achieved since then.
Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach, Trump said. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
We talk about the Internet as if it's very, very good for entrepreneurs. It's very, very good for people who want to sell their time for less than subsistence wages online.

Moving forward, the VA needs a strong leader at the top who will listen to veterans, strengthen the VA, and work with Congress to implement bipartisan reforms, Tester said in a statement last week. I look forward to meeting Admiral Jackson soon and seeing if he is up to the job.
Tax credits are another topic on which leaders are hoping to build consensus. Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) has been looking at ways to adjust the tax credits in the House bill to offer more assistance to elderly and lower-income Americans.
Beyond the job market, conservatives need policies that speak to the anxieties Americans feel about the quality of their children's schools and the costs of higher education. And they need to tilt the balance of tax relief a bit more heavily towards workers and families than it currently is.
After two thousand years they remember Eureka,
Wagner said he would support Medicaid expansion one day after members of the Senate's Republican leadership declared they still had the votes to block passage.
Appoint a Department of Veterans Affairs secretary whose sole purpose will be to serve veterans. (Trump's first VA secretary, David Shulkin, was forced out over alleged misuse of taxpayer money.)
Actually, that statement is not exactly true. In a country that spends roughly twice as much as other advanced countries for mediocre results, it would be possible to restructure the system to give most people more for less. But, alas, the Senate bill does almost nothing to restructure the way medical care is delivered, how much is consumed and how it is priced, because to do so would have meant taking on the business interests that the Republicans are counting on to finance their reelection.
TRUMP: But let's see what happens at the end of three years. Let's see who's right.
The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.
In its earlier iteration, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) contained a provision protecting tax credits for veterans, regardless of whether or not they were enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs health-care system. The version of the bill that was passed in May omitted this provision, meaning some veterans may no longer have access to subsidized private insurance.
At the Rainbow Diner just south of Pelham Parkway, nurse Robyn Pegues, 54, was having breakfast. She didn't vote for Clinton in November 2016 after having supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the primary. But she was not a fan of Trump.
Many Republicans say that is the smarter play politically. They argue that Democrats are seeking an unrealistic and costly overhaul of the health-care system that ultimately would replace private insurance.
Thursday . Kaiser Health News holds a live taping of its podcast What The Health? on
Health 202: You have such an interesting perspective as former secretary. What do you hope to accomplish overall now that you're in Congress?
Which is to say that Tanden is anything but a blind partisan.
OOF: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) have sent a letter to Azar calling on the Trump administration to halt Medicaid work requirement approvals they warn undermine access to health care.
Months-long lockdowns. Entire city populations herded through the streets for mandatory testing. The people of China could be forgiven for thinking they had seen it all during the coronavirus pandemic, Eva Dou reports. But now they face a new indignity: the addition of anal swabs — yes, you read that right — to the testing regimen for those in quarantine.
Bernie Sanders hit back at the JPMorgan Chase CEO after he criticized socialism:
So, let the Democrats pursue their doomed impeachment circus in the Senate. As they do, something truly important is happening on Capitol Hill: An American president is finally marching in defense of human life.
-- The endless stream of Russia-related hearings continue today on Capitol Hill. NPR's Philip Ewing reports: The marathon of high-profile congressional hearings continues Tuesday with a session scheduled by the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on crime and terrorism. It appears aimed squarely at the ongoing imbroglio over Trump associates' possible connections to last year's Russian election meddling. Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., titled the session 'Concurrent congressional and criminal investigations: lessons from history.' In other words: How can House and Senate committees keep clear of an executive branch process — like that being led by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller?
A second Republican, Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (Augusta), has supported certain forms of expansion for years but has objected to some aspects of the House plan. Hanger has been working with the Northam administration to overcome his objections in recent weeks, expressing optimism that they could strike a deal.
Healey's suit alleges Purdue disregarded addiction risks, misleading patients and doctors as they prescribed and took high doses of the opioid, even as opioid-related overdoses spiked.
More than 10 million Americans applied for jobless benefits in March, though experts say the real number of unemployed is higher because many people haven't been able to apply for assistance in their states. Phone lines have been so busy that many people have not been able to get through. And self-employed and gig workers, such as barbers and hairstylists, were not eligible to apply until the end of March, when the federal $2.2 trillion relief package kicked in.
There are a number of ways to get . . . this right, including good reform measures to adopt, Vogel told the paper.
The Herrings have a history of donating to conservative politicians, but they have given to Democrats, too, even to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, according to campaign finance records. Both Charles and Robert Sr. have said they voted for Barack Obama for president in 2008.
AHH: New rules released by the Trump administration will expand veteran access to private health care, a move that could reduce the amount of time they wait for care but could also shift billions of dollars away from the Veterans Affairs health-care system.
Good! Good! Come on, bring it on! Bring it on! Graham said.
Republicans have chipped away at the law in other ways that could diminish its generosity for poorer Americans. President Trump has opened the door for states to impose work requirements and other penalties on Medicaid populations, which experts say could push millions of low-income Americans off the program. The administration has also cut funding for outreach to potential enrollees in the law's insurance exchanges. Eliminating the mandate alone will cut federal health spending by $338 billion over 10 years and reduce the number of uninsured people by 13 million, the CBO said last fall.
McConnell declined to say whether Trump ought to try to take the legal fight over the ban to the Supreme Court or instead rework it. The ban, which was crafted without input from congressional leaders, has been halted by a federal court.
— Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), remarks at the Power Rising Summit in New Orleans, Feb. 22
A coalition of Democratic-led states asked the court last month to consider tackling the case during its current term, our Post colleagues Amy Goldstein and Robert Barnes report. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was among the those who asked the case be heard, said that for the sake of ending uncertainty in our healthcare system and saving lives, we're hopeful the Supreme Court will decide to swiftly resolve this repeal lawsuit.

In Congress, the Republican caucus has been hijacked by tea party zealots who dismiss them as crony capitalists while the Republican presidential nominee demonizes them for shipping jobs overseas. The Obama White House is viewed by business as hostile and unyielding, while the Democratic Party has made corporate greed a signature issue.

Advocates estimate that more than 200,000 Marylanders qualify for insurance on the state's exchange, and that many would qualify for federal assistance because their employers do not provide coverage.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), another Sanders supporter and co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus, also hopes Sanders can push Biden to address the concerns of voters who may have drifted to Trump or were indifferent to Democrats because their lives are in such a state of devastation.
• Eliminate the earnings cap on Obamacare tax credits that subsidize the purchase of health insurance. The cap currently limits the benefit to those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
[Trump can't stop talking about Russia probe, but continuing might hurt him]
-- The GOP's relentless message discipline in characterizing Democrats as moving outside the mainstream has begun to pay tangible dividends. Attacking liberals for espousing ideas like reparations and the Green New Deal, often with over-the-top hyperbole, is activating Republican voters who were deeply ambivalent just a few month ago, despite whatever unease they may feel about Trump himself.
A soon-to-be father whose wife is getting prenatal care through the Affordable Care Act . A woman whose mother would have been bankrupted by her cancer diagnosis had she not had ACA coverage. An older self-employed couple, insured under the law, who for the first time in our lives can afford to see doctors and buy medicines.
TRUMP: It's just a minor case. It's a minor case.
Beto's parents met while his mother was on a date with Amy's dad. It was 1970 when Bill Sanders picked up Melissa Martha Williams in his Porsche and sped 45 minutes from El Paso to Radium Springs, N.M., for a double date with one of his friends. Melissa can't remember the second woman who joined them, but she remembers Bill's friend clearly — his handsome face, large forehead and even larger personality; how he, too, drove a Porsche. His name was Patrick O'Rourke, and less than a year after that first meeting, Melissa would marry him, and the two would be on their way to having their first child, Robert Francis.
He did, however, give credit to Trump in one way.

Why former vice president Joe Biden's physical politicking feels different in the era of Trump and #MeToo:
And in Michigan, first-term incumbent Democrat Gary Peters has his hands full against a young, telegenic African American West Pointer named John James, who put a scare into veteran Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow in 2018.
That's more or less how Republicans have crafted their replacement bill in 2017: The individual mandate isn't struck out of the bill, but it wouldn't be enforced. (In its place is a fee for anyone who tries to buy health care at the last minute or who drops their insurance for an extended period of time.)
And to my Democratic friends who think this is a Republican problem, I say be careful. The same pattern is already unfolding on your side as progressive activists — joined by elected officeholders, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and the Squad, with aspirations of higher office — tell tales of what Democrats could accomplish if only they were willing to fight and use their power.
Michael Steel, who was a senior aide to then-Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said Trump is at a crossroads as he takes up tax reform.
At the White House: Trump will hold roundtable discussions with women who own small businesses. Later, he will have lunch with Mike Pence and Rex Tillerson before signing bills. Pence will join Trump in the small business roundtable, before the two dine with Rex Tillerson. Later in the day, he will join Trump as he signs bill.
If we don't get the trade deals done, they could turn quickly, Ernst said of pork producers, farmers, etc. What I would like it see needs to be done in the next month or two — we need to start wrapping this baby up.
With those comments, Trump sowed yet more uncertainty for health insurance companies already struggling to figure out what the business landscape will look like next year and beyond. The specific issue that insurers and the president are focused on at the moment are cost-sharing reductions, payments to health insurers that help reduce the deductibles and co-pays for 7 million Americans. The way the payments are funded has been successfully challenged in a lawsuit by House Republicans, but the administration has continued paying them while the case is on appeal. If the payments are stopped, insurers will have to decide whether to exit the market completely or raise premiums by about 15 percent — and the mere possibility that they could go away or be used as a bargaining chip may make some queasy about offering plans at all.
Medicaid advocates thought they had hit upon a fresh way to get more Republican-led states to embrace the ACA's vision of making the low-income insurance program more widely available. By collecting enough signatures, activists have been able to pose the question not just to voters in Utah and Idaho, but in Nebraska and Maine as well.
Pressed to explain how Barr could know Mueller's legal view of obstruction of justice, Barr answered: I was speculating. I was writing in the dark, and we're all in the dark.
We should always be on guard about the politician interfering in an investigation, Graham said. But we should also have oversight on how the department works and those with tremendous power use that power.
Given such strong support, a case could be made that the greatest barrier to the gospel is evangelicals' embrace of Trumpism as an ideology, Birdsall said.
No amount of tweeting by the president is going to convince a majority of the Senate today that they would collectively and individually be better off in a majority rule Senate, said Sarah Binder, a congressional expert with George Washington University.
European countries, in contrast, have started mandating that people wear medical-grade masks in public settings, and several Asian countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have mass-produced high quality masks and sent them directly to residents.

Joe Biden's 2020 campaign decision: Quietly agonizing as months go by, by Matt Viser and Michael Scherer
Former housing secretary Julián Castro, who says the border is now more secure than ever, wants to remove criminal charges for those who cross without authorization. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), whose only mention of border security in her announcement speech was a condemnation of child separation, recently introduced a bill to let undocumented young people work in Congress. And the reintroduced Medicare-for-all plan of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which has been endorsed by several of his rivals, would extend free health care to 11 million undocumented immigrants who were not covered by the Affordable Care Act.
Awwww! Boooo! exclaimed the crowd in one of their most vocal outbursts.

Unless something violates established practice of the department, I would have no authority to overrule that, Barr said.
Varn has been leaning toward Biden because he's a healing figure who might be able to patch up the wounds of division, but she really liked what she saw from Klobuchar. She's had a Biden yard sign in front of her home for a while now, but she took a Klobuchar sign with her when she left the rally. She said the two signs will go next to each other, and she will decide whether to go with Biden or Klobuchar before heading to her polling place.

-- Columnist Charles Krauthammer is one of the conservative intellectuals who repeatedly made the point in 2010 that Obamacare could never be undone once it went into effect. You cannot retract an entitlement once it's been granted, he explained last week, describing this as the genius of the left.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: Nazis didn't fall out of the sky in January '33. That movement is rooted in German history, and you can trace those roots back into the 19th century, and you can see a lot of strands coming together. That's true of the moment we live in. It didn't just happen yesterday or last year, Holocaust Museum director Sara Bloomfield said on the warning signs of fascism. (Rachel Manteuffel)
Except that Sarah Silverman knew the story was perfect material — not necessarily comedy gold, but funny enough and with a deeper message. She told her sister Laura about it in a Zoom, mentioned it to her producer, Raj Desai, and then recounted it on The Sarah Silverman Podcast a few days later.
In Kansas, then-Gov. Sam Brownback (R) cut taxes and spending with schools bearing the brunt of the fiscal axe. The first effects were seen in minority and low-income districts, but then it just started to be system-wide, Metzl said. When the issue started to hit home, all of a sudden there was a massive mobilization and people who had been supporters of Brownback's policies started to turn.
...what has just occurred is new territory, puncturing the blanket of relative security that these remote islands have long seemed to provide. Residents of Christchurch, despite the earthquakes of eight years ago, had become habituated to living in one of the world's most reputedly safe societies.
And so the chyron became a real-time vehicle for challenging Trump, a candidate and president who is often untethered to the facts. The chyrons do the heavy work of squaring the record while simultaneously adding some winks and eye rolls in the parentheses:
Key: Democrats also recognize that moving toward impeachment would energize core GOP voters ahead of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections. Pelosi's comments come as Republicans are seeking to portray Democrats as radicals beholden to the far left, unwilling to respect democratic norms.
We continue to implement the president's direction to draw down U.S. forces to a residual presence, Dunford told them in a statement.
Biden, Bennet, Swalwell and Harris all said that they would call America's NATO allies and that Trump has frayed that crucial military alliance. Biden said that NATO could be effectively destroyed if Trump won another four years in office.
The Justice Department said it wants a federal court to completely repeal Obamacare instead of just its individual mandate to buy coverage, a departure from its previous stance that the mandate was legally distinct and other provisions could still stand.
Logical or not, as a political strategy — and an impeachment trial is ultimately a political event — crying derangement (or WITCH HUNT or PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT) has worked for Trump.

-- Three Native American inmates in a Texas prison won the right to let their hair grow long in a lawsuit over religious liberties. From the Houston Chronicle's Keri Blakinger: The prison system's rules requiring men to keep short hair or face disciplinary consequences, the inmates and their attorneys argued, were an unfair violation of religious freedom … Even though female prisoners are allowed to have long hair, attorneys for the state claimed that letting men do the same would cost too much money to police, that prisoners would get too hot in uncooled facilities, that it would make identifying inmates harder and that it could increase the number of inmate suicides.
For example, Planned Parenthood provided 28,674 prenatal services during its 2011-2012 fiscal year, but now provides fewer than 8,000 similar services. It provides a little more than half the breast exams it did five years ago. Its performed abortions are also down, but by less — in the most recent year, the group provided 321,384 abortion procedures compared to 333,964 in the 2011-2012 year.

Utah parents wanted to opt their children out of Black History Month. Their school reluctantly let them, Antonia Noori Farzan reports: Facing blowback, the school reversed course Saturday and said that all students would be taking part in Black History Month. The incident is the latest controversy to demonstrate how attempting to teach students about America's past has grown increasingly fraught, with some parents and educators advocating for a more unvarnished look at the country's legacy of racism and slavery, and others pushing a 'patriotic' curriculum that glosses over many of those details.
There would be 782,000 additional jobs if pot were legalized today. That number would spike to 1.1 million new jobs by 2025, including workers at marijuana supply chains, farmers, transporters and sellers.

The paper, published in JAMA, found that although pharmacists, drugmakers, prescribers and the FDA agreed to special measures meant to monitor use, the drug was prescribed inappropriately, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. The report also found the FDA and drug companies took no action, even after they realized this was happening. Based on five years of insurance claims data, the research found between 34.6 percent and 55.4 percent of patients shouldn't have received the drugs.
Tuesday's lunch offered Senate Republicans the first chance to convene as a group since they left for a week-long holiday recess, during which many constituents and industry groups attacked Senate leaders' plan to rewrite the 2010 law known as Obamacare.
As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.
Biden shot back, I think you're so underestimating what Barack Obama did. He then effusively praised Obama's success in pulling together the Paris climate accord, which President Trump has abandoned.
And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, I support the Second Amendment. But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer. That's what he said in the last debate.
He was on a panel about freedom of association. Most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the Constitution. Some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the Constitution by activist judges. On the panel, Barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. And so, Barnett told me, I said at the end of my little talk, 'I know what you're thinking: What gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the Constitution?'  He recalled that he paused dramatically. And then, as I had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. And when I said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.
The plan won't discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, Robertson said. That's now a point of emphasis for Republicans, who spent last year's midterm elections on the defensive as Democrats accused them of abandoning people with serious medical conditions and drawing attention to a GOP-led state lawsuit against the ACA that could dismantle those protections.
Today, Ryan — now speaker — still has the House. But Trump, it appears, has the party.

Trump once again went after Amazon:
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that this book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.
Biden spent most of the past year focused on President Trump in his public comments. In recent weeks, he pivoted to present himself as the Democratic Party's best alternative to stop Sanders from securing the nomination. Now that he's essentially won that argument, Biden shifted back toward the Trump-focused message and seems intent to ignore Sanders's attacks as much as possible while issuing vague calls for the party to unify. Rhetorical question, Biden said on the Today show, have you ever, ever seen a sitting president get so involved in a Democratic primary and focus so much attention on not wanting a single person, me, to become the nominee?

With almost all of the vote counted, Democrat Raphael Warnock was leading Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican appointed to the seat, by 1.6 percentage points, or about 70,000 votes. In the second contest, Democrat Jon Ossoff led by just under one percentage point, or about 33,000 votes, over Sen. David Perdue, a Republican whose term expired on Sunday.
In a Dec. 28 follow-up letter to Irfan Nooruddin, a professor in Georgetown's School for Foreign Service, Nomani said Fair has continued to criticize her on social media, calling her an attention mongering crybully among other insults.
The common thread running through all of it is justices being treated as political actors — and in a couple cases acting that way. The subtext is that they can be installed to realize certain outcomes and pressured to decide cases in ways that align with one party or another.
By Wednesday afternoon, another friend, his wife and three of their children were also infected, Ben Guarino, Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Paul Schwartzmann report. In the span of 48 hours, what began as one family's medical crisis had spiraled well beyond their Westchester County home, shuttering Jewish schools and synagogues and crystallizing the virus's power to propel anxiety across a region that is among the nation's most densely populated.
Yet there's less gusto, and even antagonism, among some Republicans and conservatives when it comes to whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act — something 14 holdout states have yet to do.
McConnell (Ky.) is now scrambling to save a bill that aims to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He released it Thursday morning after writing it in secret for weeks with a small group of aides. After keeping the White House at a distance during the bill's crafting, McConnell is suddenly more dependent on Trump — mainly to apply political pressure on skeptical conservatives.
Well, it took a little longer than we thought, but we did it, said Lamb. You did it! You did it!
-- More bad headlines: Pruitt used an obscure water-safety provision to hire at least two former lobbyists. (he used the same provision to circumvent the White House and offer raises to two close aides.) Dino Grandoni reports: [E]thics experts say hiring lobbyists through the provision breaks with some of Trump's ethics rules, even if it's not technically illegal. As part of his commitment to 'drain the swamp' in Washington, one of the first things Trump signed after his inauguration was a far-reaching ethics directive, requiring those who join the government to sign an ethics pledge. Under the pledge, former lobbyists are banned for two years from working on any issue on which they lobbied. But EPA employees hired through the water-safety law do not have to sign the ethics pledge.
CRUZ: Well, the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant. On the face of that H1-B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.
The key and eye-popping graph that explains why some GOPers are so worried: According to data compiled by The Associated Press, Medicaid expansion accounted for 61 percent of total Medicaid spending on substance abuse treatment in Kentucky, 47 percent in West Virginia, 56 percent in Michigan, 59 percent in Maryland, and 31 percent in Rhode Island. In Ohio, the expansion accounted for 43 percent of Medicaid spending in 2016 on behavioral health, a category that includes mental health and substance abuse.
Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.
But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is. A criminal will not do it. They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.
The United States lags behind other developed countries when it comes to providing universal health care as well as paid leave for sick workers and those who have to care for family members.
Yet the idea that socialism is ascendant in U.S. politics just isn't borne out. It may be marginally more popular than it was after World War II, but the increasing comfort Democratic lawmakers feel with these proposals doesn't coincide with any real surge in support for socialism in recent years.
Oregon lawmakers were supposed to vote on a climate change bill. Once again, Republicans walked out.
One could almost sense the relief from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, in an interview yesterday with the Nevada-based Kevin Wall Radio Show. Over the past year, Azar was subject to erratic demands by Trump to come up with a viable ACA replacement — despite the fact that Republicans crashed and burned in that effort back in 2017.
— Former Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, who was temporarily filling the seat previously held by late Sen. John McCain, has rejoined the lobbying firm where he worked prior to his brief return to Capitol Hill. Covington & Burling said Monday that Kyl returned to its public policy practice. He first joined the firm in 2013 and lobbied for the top drugmakers trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, one of his biggest clients, as well as for other companies like Celgene and Qualcomm. Before his 2018 return to the Senate, Kyl also served as the sherpa for Kavanaugh during his confirmation process to the Supreme Court.
The state-level shift is also practical, Katie adds. Many of the groups have eschewed the phrase 'gun control' for 'gun safety' to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate. They hope that advocating for background checks and safe storage of existing firearms attach them to policies that will garner them support with gun owners.
Trump spoke of none of those issues, even though they have animated the Republican Party's evangelical Christian base. He focused almost entirely on the economic anxieties of working people who feel dislocated and adrift.
— Meanwhile, the Sackler Trust announced that it will halt all new charitable donations as the Sackler family, which runs the trust, faces hundreds of lawsuits over its role in the opioid crisis.
Under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy created by the FDA, drug companies, doctors, pharmacists and patients themselves received special instruction on the use of the drugs and signed up to be part of the small, closed group allowed to prescribe, dispense and take them, Lenny writes. But the report contends that those safeguards didn't work.
Most of the Democrats who piled into the race after Delaney did so as populists, or with records of endorsing popular left-wing legislation. There are five senators in the race so far, and four have endorsed Medicare-for-all.
Republicans in Congress tend to give the president the benefit of their doubt. In interviews and comments since Saturday, they have suggested that Trump overstated what was known — conflating, for example, media reports on wiretapping with a growing theory that the Obama administration seeded operatives throughout the government to undo his presidency. But they have paired that critique with promises to study what he's alleged.
Administration officials and local allies — like the mayors of Dayton, Ohio, Denver, and Columbus, Ohio, as well as Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) — have conducted more than 30 interviews with outlets in Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, Utah, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the White House official said. That's about one-third of the total interviews Team Biden has done since Inauguration Day.
The Iowa Republican and New York Democrat have teamed up to author a bill that professionalizes the way we prosecute within the military as it relates to sexual assault, despite previous disagreements on the issue. Ernst believes the handling of sexual-assault cases in the military should remain within the chain-of-command while Gillibrand has advocated for an independent military prosecutor to investigate alleged sexual misconduct.
These changes could make the Senate's health-care bill more conservative on the whole than the House version, which passed by a 217-to-213 vote on Thursday. That bill created a system of refundable tax credits, while allowing states to opt out of Obamacare's insurance regulations.
In Henniker, Hickenlooper's example was a compromise on emissions standards; at a house party in Manchester, it was the story of passing gun-safety laws after a 2012 mass shooting. Neither crowd was the size of the ones Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) or Cory Booker (N.J.) has begun to draw, but each was full of Democrats who did not consider themselves part of the far left. Every candidate, from Warren to Hickenlooper, is getting asked about togetherness.
He also recalled walking around the trenches at the Somme battlefield during a trip to France. Remember, the allies never set foot on German soil, he said. I've always thought that was one of the reasons the German military didn't care so much about stopping Hitler. Deep down inside, they thought they got sold out. Now, history would probably say when the Americans were coming in, [surrendering] was the right thing to do. You would have gotten massacred.
The poll found that 52 percent of Americans want their senators to vote for a conviction, while 45 percent prefer they vote for an acquittal. Three percent are unsure. Americans are leaning slightly more toward convicting Trump now than they did right before his first impeachment trial in 2020.
But that doesn't mean it will be easy, by any means, for Planned Parenthood to expand and ease access to abortion. Republicans, many of whom oppose abortion, have complete control over a quarter of state governments — including the governorships and state legislatures. And the group has also been shuttering dozens of clinics and providing fewer health-care services over the past several years.
In a gesture to social conservatives key to his political base, Trump broached the perennially divisive issue of reproductive rights by challenging the legality of late-pregnancy abortions — an issue lately considered in the Virginia and New York legislatures.
Klobuchar's calls for national reconciliation resonate with the kinds of moderate Democrats and independents who go to her events while Warren's promise to fight fired up the more liberal people who tend to support her. Jill Baillargeon, 36 of Exeter, has children who are 7, 5 and 2-years-old. I feel pretty good about Amy after seeing her, she said as she left Klobuchar's event, with her daughter Maeve and a miniature American flag that volunteers handed her on the way in. I was for Bernie for a while, then Warren, then Biden and now Klobuchar.
Warmbier's death could push lawmakers or the Trump administration to restrict or ban Americans from traveling to North Korea. [Reps. Adam Schiff and Joe Wilson] have introduced the North Korea Travel Control Act in the House, which would require Americans who want to travel to North Korea to obtain a license. There would be no licenses for tourists. The Senate has been more reluctant to introduce restrictions on Americans — but Warmbier's death might be the trigger that they need, analysts say. Separately, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has raised the prospect of the administration using an executive order to ban travel to North Korea.
-- Someone to watch: Rosenstein has tapped Ed O'Callaghan to serve as the acting principal associate deputy attorney general, a post from which he could help oversee the Russia probe at the Justice Department. A long-time federal prosecutor and counterterrorism expert in New York, O'Callaghan most recently served as the acting head of the DOJ's National Security Division, CNN's Laura Jarrett reports. He raised eyebrows of some former DOJ officials earlier this year when he took to the White House podium to defend the Trump administration's use of contested terrorism figures to encourage changes to immigration policies. Among those who previously held this powerful job, known internally as the Padag, are Chris Wray, Merrick Garland and Kathy Ruemmler.
Take, for example, the centerpiece of the Republican effort, transforming Medicaid from a guarantee of free health insurance for the poor and disabled into a block grant to states to finance health care for whomever they want in whatever ways they see fit.
I think I'm the only candidate who actually gets single-payer health care, he said, explaining his own experience with a single-payer system through Veterans Affairs soured him on the concept of such a system for all Americans.
But trying to circumvent voter intent could backfire. Republicans are in a tough spot, said Bill Pierce, a health policy expert at APCO Worldwide.
OUCH: China is rolling out anal swabs for the coronavirus, which it says are more accurate than nasal or throat swabs.
Vanessa Bryant sued the helicopter operator in the crash that killed her husband and daughter, and 7 others.
-- Pangolins – the world's most trafficked mammal – are suspected as a potential coronavirus host. From the NYT: It is far from clear whether being identified as a viral host would be good or bad for pangolins. It could decrease the trade in the animals, or cause a backlash. It is also far from clear whether the pangolin is the animal that passed the new virus to humans. Bats are still thought to be the original host of the virus. If pangolins are involved in disease transmission, they would act as an intermediate host. The science so far is suggestive rather than conclusive, and because of the intense interest in the virus, some claims have been made public before the traditional scientific review process.
— Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the discounts negotiated between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit manager middlemen don't directly help certain patients who are sick and paying out-of-pocket for pricey medication.
Sanders makes an admission unusual for politicians: The first question of the night went to Sanders, who was asked if his sweeping plans to expand government services — from implementing Medicare-for-all to canceling student loan debt — would result in a tax hike on the middle class.
Several of those planning to attend the Wheaton gathering said they are tired of seeing leaders who regularly praise Trump — such as evangelist Franklin Graham, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. and Texas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress — representing all evangelicals.
And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.
He said your domestic policy will lead to recession, he's said your foreign policy will make us less safe, and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities. Quoting now Romney on Trump, quote, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd, third-grade theatrics.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) sees two versions of President Trump: a combative figure whose trigger-happy social media strategy regularly hurls him into controversy, and a Republican leader committed to spearheading a staunchly conservative agenda.
Durbin also asked why, given the number of people leaving the administration, he wanted the attorney general job at all.
If Barr is confirmed as attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein's days as the No. 2 Justice Department official are numbered. Rosenstein has told people close to him that he expects to leave if Barr is installed — though there is no precise timetable in place for his departure.
Protracted administration talks with Turkey, European allies and U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters have so far failed to secure an agreement to create a safe zone in northeastern Syria, part of Mr. Trump's plan for leaving Syria, Dion and Nancy report.
Here's a check! Here's a check! It's delayed, but what the heck?
The memo did not address — or in any way question — the Special Counsel's core investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Barr said. Nor did it address other potential obstruction-of-justice theories or argue, as some have erroneously suggested, that a President can never obstruct justice. I wrote it myself, on my own initiative, without assistance, and based solely on public information.
Now, nobody is pretending we don't know exactly where Republican-appointed justices have stood on abortion rights cases in the past. But generally speaking, no matter how predictable Supreme Court vote splits have been, norms suggest they are to be treated as fundamental disagreements among justices about the Constitution — not as political acts by justices going to bat for one side or another or requiring political pressure campaigns. The balance of power relies upon the perception that the judiciary isn't just an extension of the two political parties in Washington that have the occasions to appoint the judges.
Health experts say a vaccine for this coronavirus is at least a year away from mass distribution, if not longer.

House Democrats know these next two years represent a chance to explore legislation they would enact should they find themselves in control of the White House in 2020. But they're also using their new governing power to define where the party should be on health care in a political sense, as many 2020 candidates will have to decide whether to adopt these ideas.
History will probably best remember the Michigan Democrat for championing the expansion of health care, from Medicare to Obamacare.
Among the Republicans who early on recognized Biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are Utah's Mitt Romney, Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski.
TRUMP: Let me tell you, something, Ted. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can...
This is the best poll for Trump in the state in a long time. According to HuffPollster, Clinton has led in around 20 of the most recent polls (two were tied), and a poll hasn't shown Trump up since mid-September. The averages put Clinton up slightly over three points.
When the ACA passed a polarized Congress in 2010, the idea was that about half the Americans who would gain health coverage would do so through the law's insurance marketplaces. The other half would come through Medi­caid, which was to grow nationwide to include adults earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The federal government would pay the full cost of expanded coverage for the first three years, then a decreasing amount before settling at 90 percent by 2020.

The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations holds a hearing on the rising cost of insulin on Wednesday.
But to other experts, even an 11 percent cut in provider rates could present serious challenges for private hospitals and physician practices operating on tight margins. A number of prestigious hospitals -- such as New York University, the Stanford University Medical Center, and the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center -- are especially reliant on patients with private health care and would likely see average cuts bigger than 11 percent, according to Larry Levitt, a health-care expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism. Order the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to develop a list of regions and countries to include. The list will likely include Syria and Libya. (Trump effectively did this with his travel ban from several countries, including Syria and Libya. He also at times proposed a Muslim ban — which will be cited later.)
At the same time, the GOP is trying to move quickly on confirming Alex Azar, President Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, a spot that has been vacant for about four months. The Senate Finance Committee intends to hold its confirmation hearing next Tuesday. Emboldened by their unexpected victory in Alabama, it would be easier than ever for Democrats to threaten to hinder or block Azar's nomination if Republicans don't cave to their legislative demands.
Fred Hiatt: So in a way, it sounds like you want to put dollars behind what the Business Roundtable just talked about of corporate responsibility and not just focusing on profits. They got some pushback from people who said, If you're a steel company, what you do best is make steel efficiently and reward your employees fairly for doing that. You're not an expert in graduation rates. And so in a democracy, rather than ask the steel company or the test prep [company] each to come up with their own solutions, we ought to tax those companies and then work on graduation rates through the government. But you think that's wrong?
-- The House passed a divisive farm bill that narrowly slid through the chamber just one month after lawmakers rejected an earlier version. Caitlin Dewey and Erica Werner report. The legislation, which passed 213-211 with 20 Republicans joining Democrats in their unanimous opposition, includes new work rules for most adult food-stamp recipients — provisions that are dead on arrival in the Senate. The massive legislative package overseeing more than $430 billion of food and agriculture programs over five years contains a host of measures aimed at strengthening farm subsidies, expanding foreign trade and bolstering rural development. The bill was championed by a dwindling number of farm-district Republicans who feel duty-bound to deliver farm supports to their rural constituents.

Conspicuously absent from the House Republican effort to get to 216 is much talk about what happens in the Senate. There, Republicans will run up against the Senate parliamentarian, who must rule on whether some provisions are allowable in a budget reconciliation bill — the vehicle they're using to repeal the health-care law to avoid a Senate rule requiring a 60-vote win that would require Democratic votes.
In some cases, these insurers just couldn't earn a profit when competing against plans with narrower networks and lower costs, Levitt said. More recently, uncertainty over how the Trump administration would run the ACA marketplace has caused some insurers to exit.
We had a positive and productive meeting and all parties have agreed to continue discussing a path forward to quickly resolve all of the issues ahead of us, Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement issued after the meeting.
But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.
Below, a review, with the promises from Johnson's original list in bold.
Virginia has low unemployment — 3.8 percent — but is pockmarked by wildly uneven prosperity. Coal towns in Southwest and urban housing projects in Norfolk or Richmond suffer deep poverty, while the vast Northern Virginia suburbs are among the wealthiest places in the country. Even those, though, have seen a loss of high-paying jobs and are threatened by an overdependence on government-related industries.
Other key conservatives kept their powder dry Wednesday. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) declined to say whether he would support or oppose a GOP health-care bill that included tax credits.
Open the door for abortion providers to again get family planning grants.
He spends his weekend obsessing over great men, because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it, he will never be a great man, McCain, a co-host of ABC's The View, said of Trump during Monday's episode.
Of course, there are also some differences between the co-ops and how these agriculture association plans might operate, which could indicate a more promising future for the association plans.
Ryan and other lawmakers acknowledged important details remain unknown — including, crucially, how much the Republican health proposals will cost. Ryan said the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation are scoring the fiscal effect of the various elements.
The idea sounds promising, at first glance. Republicans have long pointed to sales across state lines as a way to address booming costs in the individual insurance markets. Both the House and Senate 2017 health-care bills proposed the idea, and the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) included the idea in his health-care plan during the 2008 presidential campaign.
-- Are right-to-try laws a last hope for dying patients — or a false hope? by Laurie McGinley: Where's Jordan? asked [Mike] Pence as he walked into the White House meeting of terminally ill patients and their families. All eyes shifted, and Pence made a beeline for a 7-year-old boy from Indianapolis with a broad grin. Back home … Jordan McLinn and his battle with Duchenne muscular dystrophy had helped inspire passage of a state 'right-to-try' law intended to give the desperately ill access to medications not yet approved by the FDA. Thirty-three states have passed such laws, which ostensibly allow patients to take experimental medicines outside of clinical trials and without FDA oversight … But the increased momentum is raising alarms, with opponents saying that such laws largely offer false hope… The legislation … would forbid the federal government from interfering with the state laws and would exempt doctors and drug companies from liability for prescribing or providing experimental drugs. It also would limit the FDA in an unprecedented way: If a patient were injured or killed by an unapproved treatment under a right-to-try law, agency officials would not be allowed to use the information to delay or block approval of the treatment.
-- The Trump administration is increasingly requesting supplemental information from H-1B visa applicants and denying more petitions from high-skilled foreign workers. The Wall Street Journal's Louise Radnofsky report: Some 60% of companies that applied on behalf of foreign workers received requests for supplemental information in the last quarter of 2018, compared with about 46% of applicants who got the demand in the year-earlier quarter and 28% in the final quarter of 2016. The approval rate fell to 75% in the final quarter of 2018, from 83% a year earlier and 92% in the same period in 2016.

Then came NAFTA, CAFTA, the EPA. Stanley rattles off the alphabet soup he blames for robbing his region of textile mills, furniture-making, tobacco and coal. He figures Medicaid expansion would be no better.
States and other jurisdictions will need to ensure that they have the space and staff to administer vaccines. Another challenge may come in addressing vaccine hesitancy, which could suppress demand and make it harder for the country to reach herd immunity.
Medical groups have hailed buprenorphine as a lifesaving treatment, particularly as the opioid crisis has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States during the 12-month period ending in May 2020, the highest 12-month death count on record, Dan writes.
Warnock is not Martin Luther King Jr., but he has borrowed a sheet or two from King's playbook. Warnock speaks of government-backed health care the same way King spoke of ending segregation: This is what God wants us to do.
But more Republicans may be willing to cross the aisle now that the administration has taken an even firmer stance against the ACA, saying last week that it agrees with a federal court ruling that the entire law should be invalidated. Reed said he will again vote with Democrats on their latest resolution criticizing the administration for refusing to defend the ACA.
That is, perhaps, why Huling looks particularly excited to be performing in front of a large audience this morning. I didn't come to prolong the time, he says before giving his remarks — a warning to anyone who's spent time in a Black church that they'd better get ready to settle in.
But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law.

--We'd venture to guess President Trump's New Year's resolutions didn't include being more truthful. When The Post's fact-checker Glenn Kessler combed through the transcript of an impromptu 30-minute interview the president gave last week to the New York Times, he found 24 false or misleading claims. Below, we're highlighting Trump's health-care-oriented statements and Glenn's explanation.
You should take all these surveys with a grain of salt because the race is so fluid, but the final CNN tracking poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire and released Monday, showed Sanders in the lead, with 29 percent, among likely primary voters, followed by Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 11 percent, Warren at 10 percent and Klobuchar at 7 percent. But Klobuchar has unquestionable momentum going into primary day. Even on the eve of the vote, only about half of those polled said they had definitely made their final decision. Interestingly, Warren was at the top of the list of people's second choices: 20 percent said Warren is their back-up, followed by Sanders at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 14 percent.
And the planned cost-saving measures will buy the agency only weeks of extended resources for drug reviews. The FDA's new plans are a sign of the burgeoning impacts of the impasse, some visible and others invisible to the public, Laurie writes.

As our Congress enters a transitional period and Democrats re-gain the Majority, we must make our top priorities known to our body of government and to the American people, the group of Democrats, led by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), wrote in the letter. At a time when our state and local partners are begging for federal assistance to combat the opioid crisis in their communities, Congress must answer the call through increased resources, creative solutions, and with more legislative staff.
Second, impeachment has energized Trump's base. According to Gallup, the president's approval among Republicans is now a record 94 percent — up six percentage points since January. The more Democrats tried to take him down, the more Republicans have united behind the president.
House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) had previously said about impeachment that the facts would have to be so stark, the deed so terrible, that you believe that once it's all laid out, then you will be able to get an appreciable fraction of support from the general public.

McConnell offered two key examples to support his view. First, Trump nominated Circuit Court Judge Neil Gorsuch, a favorite of conservatives, to the Supreme Court. And second, even in areas where the president has veered away from conservative orthodoxy — notably in toying with the idea of lifting sanctions imposed on Russia — he has not taken any action, McConnell said.
The Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, which is an affiliate of the Heritage Foundation, a longtime conservative think tank, are known for staking out positions that are often at odds with those of GOP leaders.
Tennessee's Medicaid program provides insurance to around one in five Tennesseans and is currently funded by open-ended federal contributions. Under the block grant plan, however, the state would get a capped amount of money annually. While federal funding may still increase if enrollment spikes, it would not necessarily increase with other expenses. The plan also gives the state more control over the program and allows it to keep half of any money saved to reinvest in government program.

What I want to do is to lay out concrete things that we can do – without a lot of money – that will make a difference, rather than just give a speech saying I think we should do something for the job market, he said. That's what the others are going to do, but they don't have any real experience in creating jobs.
Demand Justice, a liberal group that opposed Kavanaugh's nomination, is planning a more than $10,000 digital ad campaign in Maine to inform voters of how Collins' vote for Kavanaugh helped lead to the close call in Thursday's ruling, Felicia and Michael report.

No regulation — from the Obama administration or elsewhere — caused the delays in testing. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)
There's a concern that the opportunity for virtual visits — where patients don't have to even leave their homes — might prompt a higher volume of unnecessary check-ins and tests. That's another key issue, said Farzad Mostashari, the former national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Co-ops were also required to cover a certain set of benefits laid out by the ACA, whereas association plans will be subject to a varying set of requirements depending on the state in which they operate. And association plans typically use a third party to administer the coverage, whereas co-ops tried to do this internally – and failed miserably.
OOF: Yesterday, former HHS secretary Tom Price walked back his comments questioning Republicans' decision to repeal the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. Price, formerly a harsh critic of the mandate, raised eyebrows Tuesday when he said the move would increase prices for people buying insurance through the government-run marketplace.
The government's top infectious-disease expert on Monday reiterated that the United States will stick to a plan to inoculate tens of millions of Americans with two doses of coronavirus vaccine, as calls mount to protect more people by letting them get one shot now, The Post's Dan Diamond reports.
I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.
On the trail, Trump said his superior negotiating skills would allow him to quickly build a concrete wall along the southern border, funded by Mexico. No problem.
This is the driving principle behind nearly everything the Republicans are trying to do in domestic affairs (the foreign affairs version is we're on our own, and to hell with everyone else). Here are a few recent examples.
The Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup. Here's what D.C. looked like during the final game:
Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.
[Why Obamacare is unlikely to die a swift death]
I said, I don't know. I said, I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.
DelBene added: We worked with Treasury and IRS to craft the legislation in a way that helps them succeed … the IRS has done really impressive things when given the proper resources to do so.
The move has been anticipated for months, after congressional lawmakers passed legislation last spring that empowered the administration to make substantial changes to veterans health care, Jennifer writes. Critics fear that private health care, which tends to have higher costs than government-provided care, will force the department to cut corners elsewhere.
Warren also challenged Azar on the administration's plan to move drugs administered through Medicare Part B to the supplemental Medicare Part D, where pharmacy benefit managers negotiate prices with drugmakers. She wanted assurance that no one on Medicare would end up paying higher prices as a result of the change. Azar responded that protecting Medicare beneficiaries was the primary concern, but did not give Warren the definitive answer she sought.
— The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to review a federal court's decision to strike down a Maryland law aiming to prohibit generic drug manufacturers from price gouging consumers.
Americans were told to use the Get My Payment portal on the IRS website to check on the status of their payment and see if they need to input their bank account information. But many people who went on the portal received a message that the IRS doesn't know the status of their payment. Or they were locked out altogether.
The changes probably were not connected to poor financial prospects or substance abuse, the report said, noting that they occurred during a period of economic expansion and at a time when drug and alcohol use among young people has been unchanged or decreasing, Tara writes. Instead, the report said, the increases may be linked to increased time spent on social media and electronic communication, along with a decrease in the sleep young people are getting.

But despite all Trump's efforts to destroy Obamacare, health policy experts say he hasn't and probably can't end the law on his own.
— In a new report, the Congressional Budget Office found more than 1 million Americans have lost health coverage since 2016.
While noting that McCain opposed Obamacare, the documents says he voted against the bill presented to the U.S. Senate — his famous 'thumbs down' — because it was 'repeal, without 'replace.'
The new chapter comes as groups like Everytown acknowledge the gun lobby in Washington and engrained views about gun rights pose a major obstacle in changing gun laws at the national level. The group's One Thing You Can Do campaign looks to educate people who live in the 13 states and District of Columbia with red flag laws about how they work.
Either they believe in returning decision-making to the people at the state level, even in cases where they may disagree policy-wise, or they don't, he said. But to simultaneously hold both positions lacks credibility.
'This is one of those days when the whole world changes,' said Jane Manning, a former sex-crimes prosecutor in New York and director of the Women's Equal Justice Project. 'A sexual predator who was so powerful that he thought he could never be touched has just been held accountable,' Caitlin Gibson and Elahe Izadi report. Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor of law at Northwestern University, noted that most sexual assault cases that enter the legal system are more likely to fit the stereotypical 'stranger rape' paradigm — involving a woman who is assaulted by someone she doesn't know, resulting in apparent physical injury and, potentially, DNA evidence. The Weinstein case, in contrast, presented a far more complicated portrait of sexual violence — and the fact that New York prosecutors even filed charges against him is 'extraordinary,' she said.
Two of the lowest-polling candidates — de Blasio and Delaney — also interrupted and interjected often.
You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class. During World War II, Detroit provided -- funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II. In -- in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America. It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.
-- The Pentagon announced it would house up to 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children on military bases in coming months. Dan, Seung Min and Nick report: In a notification to lawmakers, the Pentagon said Wednesday night that officials at HHS asked whether beds could be provided for children at military installations 'for occupancy as early as July through December 31, 2018.' The plan seemingly will have similarities to 2014, when the Obama administration housed about 7,000 unaccompanied children on three military bases. … The sites will be run by HHS employees or contractors working with them, the memo said.
The abortion rights group says Collins turned her back on women when she voted in 2018 to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a move that mobilized liberal activists against her, as our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz writes.
-- Schiff spoke a few hours after Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), one of the jurors, questioned Vindman's patriotism by propagating an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory from the fever swamps of the dark corners of the pro-Trump fringe Internet. Blackburn claimed that Vindman once badmouthed the United States to Russians while serving overseas. Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot, she tweeted. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?
What [El Salvador is] doing is working, both on the security front and on the economic opportunity front, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in July.
Labrador is not the first Republican lawmaker to face a hostile crowd during a town hall meeting. Republicans who've hosted town halls in the past several months have been met with protests, boos and sharp rebukes from attendees. Some have opted against holding town halls, while President Trump has dismissed the so-called crowds as liberal activists.
Andrew Yang: Well well, part of it is I don't have any talking points. So if you were to watch 100 interviews with me, there'd be a lot of similarities, no doubt. But there's something different about each one of them because I would go insane otherwise. So I might get an identical question and answer it differently depending upon the day. Honestly, because I'm a human being and you know, like, sometimes something else is a more appealing.
Legislators could go into overtime if they do not reach a deal before adjournment Saturday. Or they could punt, sending Northam a budget without expansion, which he could send back with an amendment that adds it.

We were speaking in a diverse pocket on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the borough that most people identify with when they think of New York City. Further south, the Upper West Side is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country. Where we were, an area known as Manhattan Valley, it was more of a mix: Wealthier people to the west but a large housing project a block to the east.
Asked for a review of Trump's first year, she was unsparing.
Overall spending on people with workplace coverage could be lowered by 9 percent if hospitals and doctors all set their prices at the median rate for each medical service, according to researchers with the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit funded by the insurance industry.
-- Politico Magazine, Young Trumpies Hit D.C., by Daniel Lippman and Ben Schreckinger: Washington is a hipper city now than it's ever been, a place where staffers, especially young staffers who want to drink and date and live normal millennial lives, would want to live. The problem is, if you work for Trump, it's also more hostile territory than it's ever been.
Now negotiators are trying to hash out differences in two wildly different budgets. The House version has about $420 million extra for teachers' raises, Metro and other priorities because of savings the state is projected to realize if Medicaid is expanded. There is no easy way to split that baby.
Meanwhile, Iran is closer to being able to make a nuclear weapon now than when Trump took office, because of his foolish abandonment of the nuclear deal. The mullahs might even decide that the only way to ensure their safety is to race to build a bomb — which could also lead to all-out war.
Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level.

The publication noted that of the 23 Republicans sitting in districts that Clinton won last year, 14 voted for the GOP bill, which has been widely panned in public polls.
I love the department and all its components, including the FBI — I think they're critical institutions that are essential to preserving the rule of law, he told Durbin, promising: I'm going to do what I think is right.
Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party's congressional majorities.
Krugman doesn't shy from calling out the mean-spiritedness that underlies much of the conservative agenda. One new essay is titled The Cruelty Caucus. Indeed, there's little economic rationale for cutting food stamps for work-eligible adults, as the Trump administration has; Krugman notes that the United States actually spends very little helping low-income Americans. Nor is there a financial rationale for opting out of Medicaid expansion, as 14 states have. Refusing free money that would help the poor is something else — it's cruelty for its own sake, Krugman writes.
— Leaked audio from a meeting of Juul Labs employees highlights the frustrations within the company, BuzzFeed News reports. Layoffs and cutbacks have worsened moral.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the HELP committee that grilled Azar on the issue yesterday, called the DOJ's argument in the Texas case as far-fetched as any I've ever heard. Congress specifically repealed the individual mandate penalty, but I didn't hear a single senator say that they also thought they were repealing protections for people with preexisting conditions, Alexander said in a statement.
Whitehouse wrote Barr that the group received nearly all of its funding from one dark money group and he asked Barr to be prepared to discuss that topic. Senate staff said this area of questioning could lead to a discussion of Barr's connection to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, and its influential executive vice president, Leonard Leo.
He also targets Trump's main selling point.
When you Google evangelicals, you get Trump, Birdsall said. When people say what does it mean to be an evangelical, people don't say evangelism or the gospel. There's a grotesque caricature of what it means to be an evangelical.
Before you do anything else, see if there's any relief available for some of your bills.
Six years later, Ryan is leaving a far different Republican Party, with much of his own promise unrealized. As he prepares to retire after 2 1/ 2 years as House speaker, he leaves behind a legacy of dramatically expanded government spending and immense deficits, a GOP president unchecked, a broken immigration system, and a party that's fast abandoning the free-trade principles that he himself championed.
Recalling a speech Biden gave when he was a younger presidential candidate, Swalwell said several times it was time for the former vice president to take his own advice and to pass the torch.
OUCH: Yesterday, Alabama filed a lawsuit against the maker of OxyContin for its contribution to the opioid epidemic -- just the latest of dozens of states and local governments suing drugmakers over the opioid crisis. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall announced the federal lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, claiming the company led a deceptive marketing campaign that misled patients about the risks of the drug, Reuters reports.
3:40 p.m.: Barr calls gun violence 'the problem of our time'
Anyone who hasn't personally examined the president shouldn't speculate about his health status, the American Psychiatric Association said in a statement this week. Doing so undermines the work of psychiatrists, who operate just like physical doctors by reviewing patients' medical history and performing a thorough examination before offering any diagnosis, the APA said.
In his afternoon testimony, Barr acknowledged that the current background check system for firearms is sort of piecemeal and called for states to pass red flag laws, which would allow guns to be temporarily seized from those people deemed a threat. Such laws would help supplement background checks to ensure people with mental illnesses could not obtain a gun, Barr said.
But Jayapal said she's confident she'll have 100 co-sponsors by the time of the bill's planned Feb. 26 release, explaining she's not surprised members would take more time to consider it given its length.
It's also significant that this first setback emerged from a challenge originally brought by states. Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, the lead challenger, has argued that this is template for further resistance by states, in the courts and out, that could make a difference in other areas where Trump may unleash regressive and destructive onslaughts, such as Obamacare, climate change and other aspects of his promised immigration crackdown.
But Schultz might be right that voters skeptical of Trump yet not ready to support more liberal candidates are looking for a third way, my Post colleague Eugene Scott writes. It might be Klobuchar — not the billionaire — who can fill those shoes.
Ryan: New health-care law 'is what we've been dreaming of doing' (Reuters)
The federal government, Trump said, should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts.
Glenn Kessler has a new fact check this morning of Sanders's attack against Biden over Social Security: [It] mostly relates to a mid-1990s effort to rein in budget deficits though adoption of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Biden voted for it in 1996, though it did not pass. A balanced-budget amendment by itself would not require cuts in certain programs, but in the 1980s, Biden had co-sponsored a bill calling for a one-year across-the-board freeze in spending, including eliminating cost-of-living increases for one year for Social Security and Medicare.
Since taking office, Trump has taken many steps to ensure our tax dollars are not used to subsidize the taking of innocent human life. He got a record number of conservative judges confirmed during his first year; allowed states to defund Planned Parenthood; defunded the pro-abortion United Nations Population Fund; restored and expanded the Mexico City policy banning taxpayer funds for groups that perform abortions overseas; and exempted organizations with moral objections against providing abortifacient drugs from the Obamacare Health and Human Services mandate. He is, as SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser put it Tuesday, the most pro-life president in our nation's history.
In Georgia, they worship God. In small, red-brick buildings next to cotton fields. In strip malls next to bargain outlets. In large multimillion-dollar complexes with expansive parking lots, they praise His name. But Georgians do not always worship together. And they do not always receive God's message in the same way. Centuries of racial and social segregation mean that while Black and White may be a part of the same body of Christ, they aren't necessarily in communion with each other.
The public — mostly through the National Institutes of Health — ­already contributes richly to the research that underlies basically all modern drugs. But once a breakthrough looks imminent, the research is often turned over to pharmaceutical firms to carry out the last stages of developing a drug and profiting from it. Why not go all the way, and set up a public program parallel to compete with the private firms in developing and testing new drugs, and keep those publicly developed drugs outside the patent system, as the economist Dean Baker and others have described? These new drugs could immediately be manufactured cheaply as generics. Research could be directed toward the drugs that are most needed, not the most profitable, while testing would be performed by scientists without conflicts of interest.
So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
These preexisting conditions, as they are known, tend to be more common in the South and Midwest, according to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation — parts of the country where Trump triumphed in November's election.
Trump is happier now that he's off social media, a former aide said. The president has said he feels happier now than he's been in some time, former Trump campaign strategist Jason Miller told the U.K.'s Sunday Times. He's said that not being on social media, and not being subject to the hateful echo chamber that social media too frequently becomes, has actually been good. Former first lady Melania Trump, Miller added, backed up the sentiment by saying the president is enjoying himself much more.
Even with the rebrand, the program retains the original mission long sought by conservatives: allowing states to cap a portion of their spending on Medicaid, a radical change in how the safety net health program is financed, they write.
CRUZ: He's told us to look to the CNN poll. Well, that's a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points. He doesn't just lose close; he loses by 8 points. That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton.

And as Trump promised to return power to struggling families, two of his wealthiest benefactors — casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and wife Miriam — were among the day's guests of honor, scoring prime aisle seats behind Trump on the dais. [A fierce will to win pushed Donald Trump to the top]
The new study appears to be the first to conduct a county-by-county examination of overdose deaths and Medicaid expansion. It found an 11 percent decline in the death rate from heroin overdoses and a 10 percent drop in deaths from illegal fentanyl and its analogues.
It's still premature to be declared a cure, according to the report of the patient's case in the journal Nature, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports.
This is an idea Trump proposed in his February budget and one the drug industry says could save the federal government anywhere from $8 billion to $73 billion over a decade if behavioral changes are taken into account. Instead of pocketing part of the drug rebates, insurers selling Part D plans would have to pass on at least one-third of the sum to enrollees at the point of sale.
Such a proposal has almost no chance of passing a politically split Congress, but it delighted Trump's ideological allies.
That latter point might be particularly critical. The president has answered some questions in writing from Mueller's team, but Barr would likely have to approve Mueller's issuing a subpoena to force him to answer more.
We drew this conclusion from face-to-face interviews we conducted with several hundred incumbent lawmakers in Belgium, Canada and Israel as part of a project called Infopol. During these hour-long sessions, we asked the participating politicians to fill out surveys on tablets and laptops that we handed to them, presenting them with decision-making experiments. At the same time, we also had several thousand citizens in these countries answer the same questions, serving as a comparison group. All of the questions we posed to politicians in these experiments were about policy. They dealt with budgetary decisions, government loans, building community centers and responding to public health crises. In short, they looked a lot like the hundreds and thousands of issues on which politicians make judgments each year.
Maybe the administration is confused. Nobody knew health care could be so complicated, after all. Maybe it's just callous. At some point, the two excuses become indistinguishable.
According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.

Who's to blame? Rebate agreements between insurance plans and pharmaceutical companies, Gottlieb said. Insurers and pharmaceutical benefit managers typically want to cover drugs with higher list prices because they get a cut of the price in a rebate. The lower the list price, the smaller their rebate.
Kirsten Gillibrand. She has reintroduced the Family Act, her paid-leave plan that, thanks to the Democratic House, may get its first markups and votes. (It differs from the plan pushed by Ivanka Trump and Republicans in that it would be paid for with a new, small payroll tax, not from diverted Social Security funds.)
Starting in January of 2017…the president, and often with the help of this Republican Congress, has engaged in a very deliberate, very purposeful campaign of sabotage to the American health-care system, Murphy said.
The key quote: Yes, I can say quite clearly: Don't come over... Don't leave your town or city or community, Biden said.
The Ohio Department of Insurance is also trying to lure more insurers into its empty counties. Spokesman Chris Brock told The Health 202 that Ohio will be having conversations with HHS throughout the process.
Bloomberg: No, but all of the people came from the same place, and all came — were from a place that happened to be one religion.

-- The back-and-forth between the president and his aide's spouse continued on Twitter this morning:
The exact number is not readily available. We checked with several veterans' groups and the VA, but there was no specific figure. One reason is that VA health care eligibility is constantly being adjusted, said Dan Caldwell, director of policy for the conservative Concerned Veterans for America: It is likely that a large portion of that 7 million veteran population have employer-provided insurance or other coverage which would exclude them from getting a tax credit regardless of whether they are eligible for VA health care.
April 30. Trump, in an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, says he insisted that coverage for preexisting conditions needed to be in the replacement bill: Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, preexisting is not covered.' Preexisting conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, 'Has to be.' 
[Analysis: The House rush on health care bill reeks of recklessness]
-- Pelosi may be half a world away from the Senate floor, but that doesn't mean the speaker doesn't have the trial under control. From the Times: Even in her absence from the Capitol this week, as the speaker traveled through Poland and Israel … she had her hand firmly on the tiller. … In many ways, Ms. Pelosi is the eighth, largely unseen manager of the Democrats' case. … Ms. Pelosi has dispatched her handpicked House general counsel to sit at the table inside the Senate chamber, with the prosecutors acting as her eyes and ears. She reviewed all the managers' written briefs before they were filed.
Barr pledged to seek counsel from career Justice Department ethics officials about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the special counsel's investigation, but that ultimately, the final decision would be up to him as head of the department.

$500 million over 10 years — are you kidding me? she said during a closed-door meeting, Politico's Adam Cancryn reports. Who gave him that figure? It's like the cost of his protection of his Mar-a-Lago or something.
The plan did not win over Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City), who has opposed Medicaid expansion. But in off-the-cuff remarks to a handful of reporters days earlier, he sounded resigned that it would eventually pass. On Wednesday, Norment said the House might win over a few Republican senators if it developed a plan in collaboration with GOP senators with expertise in health care.
New Mexico. On Monday, Sen. Tom Udall became the first Democrat in the 2020 cycle to call it quits. There are bad times for incumbents to retire, as when senators leave ahead of a tough midterm election for their party — as Democrats discovered in 2014, when Iowa's Tom Harkin, Nebraska's Ben Nelson and South Dakota's Tim Johnson all ceded their seats to Republicans. Udall is doing something else, creating an opening in a presidential year in a state that has trended blue.
Back at the black-tie gala in Union Station — as McGahn and McConnell conclude what can only be described as a sedentary victory dance; as the four Federalist-friendly justices disperse into the night; as deputy AG Rosenstein and acting AG Whitaker linger for pictures with groups of giddy fans — I ponder: What now? Having reached this summit, what's left for the Federalist Society to conquer?
OOF: Sen. Michael Bennet, the Colorado Democrat considering a 2020 presidential run, criticized calls by some Democrats to eliminate private insurance in pursuing Medicare-for-all.
OUCH: Federal regulators identified a cancer-causing contaminant that tainted millions of bottles of a commonly used blood pressure and heart failure drug. Agency officials have said 1 to 2 million people may have taken the tainted medicines.
TRUMP: He doesn't show up to vote.
Barr again sought to downplay his comments critical of the Mueller probe, including his remarks that he wished Mueller's team of lawyers were more politically balanced. Barr said that comment was very mild.
The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health holds a hearing on Overcoming Pharmaceutical Barriers on Feb. 5.
Health 202: They're in blissful ignorance of how Congress works, I guess.
There's always a chance Republicans figure something out behind closed doors with House Republicans that won't take away health care from millions or leave the health-insurance markets to implode. If they can, perhaps the drama surrounding the process will fade into the background.
Trump derisively referred to that stupid plastic button that made us all look like jerks, a reference to the red reset button that Clinton presented to the Russian foreign minister early in the Obama administration.
RUBIO: Yes, I would just say a couple of things. There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections. There is no doubt about that. The numbers are there.
Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.
The president offered his condolences to the families of Otto Warmbier and the sailors who died on USS Fitzgerald:
Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.
• Tax capital gains as ordinary income, which would almost double the current 20% rate on stock trades and real estate deals for people earning more than $1 million a year. This would effectively eliminate the so-called carried interest tax break enjoyed by private equity managers.
[Fox host Jeanine] Pirro and Trump speak regularly, and the two had a conversation before he tweeted, according to a person briefed on the call. The president's relationship with Pirro dates back decades and is rooted in their common presence in a certain New York social circle. Trump has granted Pirro regular interviews, and he encourages his advisers to do the same. … A source familiar with the inner workings of Fox News said the president isn't on the phone with producers or executives in charge of coverage. He calls opinion hosts with whom he has a preexisting relationship, this person said.
Burrell said he was worried that the market was in the early stages of a death spiral, in which sick people who need insurance stay in the pool but healthier people drop out, causing insurers to raise rates — driving even more healthy people out of the market.
No one was shot and killed in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017, the day Obama gave his farewell speech, according to the Chicago Police Department.
That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now, she added.
Trump is apparently unaware that participation has declined in means-tested programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps).
Republicans have long complained that the safety-net program is overly burdensome to state budgets and doesn't contain enough incentives for people to better their own lives. Verma says the block grants will give states more control over their own spending and allow them to more nimbly respond to the needs of their enrollees.
-- Opium use booms in Afghanistan, creating a 'silent tsunami' of addicted women, by Pamela Constable: Drug addiction in Afghanistan, once mostly limited to men who spent years as laborers or war refugees in Iran, has exploded into a nationwide scourge that affects millions of people, including a growing number of women and children. Over the past five years, programs of crop eradication and substitution have been largely abandoned as foreign funding has ended and insurgent attacks have increased. As a result, tens of thousands of farmers have returned to the lucrative business of growing opium poppies. Last year, 420,000 acres in Afghanistan were devoted to poppies, and opium production rose 43 percent over 2015, to 4,800 tons, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.
In the process, the president has displayed a remarkable lack of sensitivity to McCain's very serious health issues. McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer a year ago and hasn't been in the Senate since December to cast a vote.
As it happens, a lot of people on the left dislike Summers for a variety of reasons, only some of which have to do with the fact that he's remembered as an advocate of pinched ambitions in the Obama years. You could say the same about Rahm Emanuel, who was Barack Obama's first chief of staff. Emanuel's name keeps being leaked as a potential appointee — first for secretary of transportation, then for ambassador to China — and each time, the pushback from the left is intense.
But whether it was advisable to use her thumb in this particular circumstance is separate question — given how existential many liberals have cast this issue as being. The minimum wage is often an issue that gets vastly oversimplified in our political debate, but it's one that inspires huge passions on the left, and the criticism from House liberals drives that home.
I don't see Express Scripts operating in Germany, for example, said Kaltenboeck, referring to the country's largest PBM.
And this is not just schools — like, health insurance companies. Every year, what's their business model? It's just jack up the prices a little bit. There are three core sources of inflation in American life that are driving us all miserable: housing, education and health care. Now, unfortunately, those three are like the pillars of American life and a middle-class existence. So if your wages and compensation stay essentially the same, but then I jack up the price of college every year and I jack up the price of your health insurance every year, then you become increasingly unhappy and miserable. That's what's happening with the American people right now. And this is again, a space where the government looks up and is like, well, I guess it's appropriate that we're charging this much or you're charging this much because you're the boss.
I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
Regulations and deadlines for making the decision regarding our participation vary by state and we intend to continue our dialogue with regulators until that time, Porras said.
OOF: FDA inspectors found a Mylan manufacturing plant in West Virginia may have recorded that drugs passed tests even when they fell short of U.S. standards, during an inspection in November 2016, Bloomberg News's Anna Edney wrote in this first in a series of four investigative pieces.
And then the Republicans and conservatives in Congress will look up and say, Wait a minute, how do I feel about this dividend? A lot of people in my district seem very excited about it. The one state that's had a dividend for almost 40 years, Alaska, is a deep-red conservative state and it was passed by a Republican governor. This is a big win for rural areas that are struggling and red states on the interior that have gotten blasted by automation. And so we just need some of these Republican congressmen to say, I am for the dividend because I'm for economic freedom. And if you get a majority, then you can pass it. Now, can you get all of them? Almost certainly not. But this is a law like any other. So you don't need a supermajority. You just need a congressional majority to pass the bill.
But at the same time, Biden doesn't want to make the mistake that President Bill Clinton did nearly two decades before, when he was trying to pass his own version of a bill that aimed to provide universal health coverage. The 1993 bill, put together by a task force run by first lady Hillary Clinton with little input from Congress, was a complicated and heavy-handed approach that would have required employers to provide health benefits to their workers.
The nomination of Donald Trump would be a complete disaster for conservatism. It poses the very real risk of shattering conservatism's most viable political vehicle — the Republican Party — by transforming the party into an institution that, among other things, embraces morally appalling policies (the mass roundup and forced deportation of 11 million unlawful immigrants; You're going to have a deportation force) and un-American intolerance (a total and complete ban on Muslims entering the country) and that stokes prejudice, nativism and cruelty. Conservatism, properly understood, is motivated in large part by gratitude and aspiration. Trump's message and agenda are motivated by anger, fear and exclusion.
When you've got a situation where our president said something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn't know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem, Bennet said. He was referring to doubts among allies about the Trump administration's assertion that Iran was responsible for a recent attack on commercial ships there.
He is someone who is universally respected across party lines in the United States Senate, where he has served the American people for two decades. I know most of you know this, but he served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama for 12 years and was Alabama's attorney general for two years. He's worked inside the Department of Justice for 15 years, loves the department's people and its mission.
Purdue alleges that some claims made by Healey are contradicted by the Massachusetts Department of Health and the FDA, which approved the medication and its labeling, Katie adds. Purdue argues that Healey is putting forward a 'misleading narrative' about OxyContin.
Rep. Mike Burgess (R-Tex.), the Health subcommittee's ranking member, said he's concerned that they do not adequately address the affordability of health insurance.
Researchers found that the most effective way to combat the overuse of prescription painkillers should be to concentrate on the heaviest prescribers.
SPICER: Betsy is not just a critic who points out problems. She's a leader who's been fixing them. Her efforts to improve every school is critical to the administration's urban renewal plan. She'll be a stalwart advocate for students, especially low-income and special needs children, and a strong supporter of greater schools in all forums and dedicated teachers who strive every day to help students achieve.
KELLY: So you abandoning the position on your website...
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
As I approach, Conway is being congratulated by people coming up from all sides.
Bottom line: The GOP can only cite the CBO for policies that would result in 1.4 million jobs supposedly being lost, not millions. That policy, the minimum-wage hike, is only about three percent of the bill's cost, not 25 percent.
-- A group of progressive House freshmen called on their fellow Democrats to reject any border-security bill that would increase funding for ICE or the Border Patrol agency. The Hill's Rafael Bernal reports: Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and a coalition progressive immigrant rights groups collected 200,000 signatures on a petition to reject any funding for detention centers or deportation agents. … The petition's requests closely match a letter sent by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) to Homeland Security conferees Wednesday.
The president did not identify how much additional money the government would devote to the effort, saying only that his budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.
They added: The latest round of evacuations, which began Wednesday in China, was the first sign that the unexplained ailments have now broadened and threaten to become a full-blown health crisis like the one that affected at least 24 diplomats and their families in Cuba.
And that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. By then Barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (Josh Blackman, a popular Federalist social media force and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.) Barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'You want to do something about this?' I said, 'Sure.' … And he said, 'Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' 
Working toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for Medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. The next year, House Democrats cosponsored H.R. 676, a Medicare for all bill.
6. Who is key to keeping the 50 Senate Democrats together?
One of the Republicans he connected with was Karen Shandor, a registered nurse, who decided to vote for Handel after watching her promise to cut taxes during one of the televised debates. She thinks having another Republican in Congress will help Trump advance his agenda. I'm having a really hard time. My money doesn't go as far as it used to, she said. We may not see changes right away with what Trump is doing, but I feel like in the long run it will benefit us.
The tight race added to Republican woes on a day that began with the surprise firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and a string of related dismissals. Republicans who hoped to fight the Pennsylvania race on the growing economy, and on the president's new tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, found the White House frequently alienating some of the voters they needed.
A polling firm noted these undesirable numbers for Trump in advance of the 2020 election:
We have become a divided and siloed citizenry, each of us eyeing our neighbors with suspicion and a sometimes willful lack of understanding. Too many of us interpret freedom as an individual pursuit rather than a communal one. We are uncomfortable with imprecision, with shades of gray. We don't like to admit when we're wrong, which we so often are. We fear a world in which our place is small, instead of marveling at the vast diversity of our universe.
-- The Trump administration insisted the U.S. military would remain in Iraq, setting up a conflict with senior Iraqi officials, who want an immediate withdrawal. Dan Lamothe, Mustafa Salim and Liz Sly report: Trump, speaking at the White House, said that withdrawing the estimated 5,000 U.S. troops would be the 'worst thing to happen to Iraq.' 'At some point, we want to get out,' Trump said. 'But this isn't the right point.' … The chaos has been highlighted by the reaction in Baghdad to a letter sent by a senior U.S. commander to Iraqi officials Monday. The document suggested that the United States may be preparing to withdraw its troops. ... Iraqi officials said Tuesday that they are interpreting the letter as notification that U.S. troops will leave. Acting prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the document 'was clear' and expressed exasperation with conflicting U.S. signals. … Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, speaking at the Pentagon, dismissed the letter as 'a draft' that 'has no value,' and he insinuated that its release to the public in Iraq may have had ulterior motives.
How long the expanded safety net provisions remain in place will depend on how many weeks or months the economic shutdown to contain the coronavirus is sustained.
That latter figure, though, is inflated by Trump's having endorsed a lot of candidates in 2020 who were in no danger of losing, according to a Cook Political Report analysis. Trump's candidates won about 58 percent of the time in contests that were rated as leaning one direction or the other. His candidates won a much better 89 percent of the time when the races were rated toss-ups.
Twice in recent months, Chief Justice John Roberts has sided with liberal justices in abortion cases, voting in February to suspend enforcement of a Louisiana physician-credentialing regulation, and in December turning away a petition from Republican states seeking the right to disqualify Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, Jacob reports. Conservative advocates say the high court's actions so far could mean it isn't likely to make a change to the precedent set by Roe v. Wade.
I don't think people understand just how bad this was, Olympian Aly Raisman told Post columnist Sally Jenkins. I don't think they have all the pieces and understand how USA Gymnastics and the USOC created the perfect environment for this monster.
As voters made their decisions Tuesday, Trump loomed large in the minds of many.
And I said, I know. I know that because I buy the product.
Near the end of the hearing, Barr drove home what might be the biggest revelation of the day: Mueller's report might not be made public.
Just as Coons slipped back into the Sessions session, a protester was ejected out of it — an older woman with a neat cap of white hair, brandishing a sign reading No Torture Cabinet.
The Senate majority leader's insistence that he will coordinate Trump's impeachment trial with the White House — and that he has no intention of being impartial — has provoked howls of protest from Democrats. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused McConnell of orchestrating a coverup of Trump's actions.
Mitt Romney was a small business guy if you really think about it, Trump says in an interview on CNN. He was a hedge fund. He was a funds guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. … He'd buy companies; he'd close companies; he'd get rid of jobs.
Sanders, whom critics accused in 2016 of being too conservative on guns, faced scrutiny over his past comments as well as a direct challenge from Swalwell, who has sought to position himself as the field's staunchest advocate of gun restrictions.
So far the only thing I have seen is additional flexibility at the state level. For me, it is not enough, said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). I want something substantial to justify a vote for that.
But one Democrat, a longtime friend of Stanley's, was so bothered by the hardball tactic that he tipped him off and then persuaded fellow Democrats to approve the bill. To top it off, Stanley's pal whisked him from Richmond to the North Carolina border, and there, on grounds of defunct Patrick County Hospital, signed the Republican's bill into law.
— As Trump gears up for his drug speech, Democrats are trying to take back the issue on the campaign trail, The Post's Erica Werner and Carolyn Y. Johnson report. Democrats are pushing proposals they hope will compare favorably to Trump's and give them the upper hand on an issue polls consistently rank as among voters' top concerns.
The Chamber is blasting the proposal as foreign price controls, The Hill's Jessie Hellmann reports and will launch cable, digital and print ads through early to mid-March to call on the Trump administration to ditch the plan and for lawmakers to oppose it.
Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate.
Deep in Trump country, this should have been a slam-dunk for Republicans. FiveThirtyEight reminds us that before Murphy, the Republican had won eight consecutive elections in this district by margins of no fewer than 15 percentage points. In both 2014 and 2016, no Democrat even bothered to run against Murphy. President Trump carried the 18th District by nearly 20 points (58 percent to 39 percent); Mitt Romney won it by a similar margin in 2012. In other words, this race should not be close.
But as the saying goes, correlation does not equal causation.
Ayres said that Trump's troubles are clearly a factor in Handel's race against Democrat Jon Ossoff, as well as in other upcoming contests.
Medical examiner findings will play a key role in Derek Chauvin's trial.
By 2015, however, Sebelius said, the law's coverage provisions were firmly in place.
When Bennet was finished, an aggrieved Cruz took back the floor. He lamented about Bennet's angry speech attacking him personally.
Week 1369, jokes based on misheard words
Trump's counterprogramming: On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted a video mocking a technical glitch during the debate proceedings. Thank you @MSNBC, real professionals! he wrote. The night before, Trump didn't offer much commentary on the event beyond a tweet calling the whole thing BORING!
The president and Republican governors contend that this abrupt turn in Medicaid, one of the most enduring legacies of the Great Society of the 1960s, will propel poor people to economic self-reliance, Amy writes. In Arkansas, however, 18,000 people so far have lost their insurance, including 85 here in Lee County, state figures show.
Using the account @perma_ben, Ben Mora, a regional field director for Sanders' campaign based in Michigan, has attacked other Democrats in the field—as well as their family members, surrogates, journalists, and politically active celebrities—in deeply personal terms, mocking their physical appearance, gender, and sexuality, among other things, the Daily Beast reports. Mora, the Sanders campaign confirmed, has been fired.
Democrats blasted the Trump administration's partial vape ban, saying it's riddled with loopholes and won't be effective in curbing underage vaping.
Warning: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed to block even the most basic aspects of business if Democrats eliminate the filibuster of business if Democrats eliminate the filibuster in a floor speech sparked by calls from the No. 2 Senate Democrat, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), to change the rules. He threatened a scored earth response that would turn the Senate into a 100 car pileup.
The cruel irony of the pandemic is that, in times of social strife, Black people have counted on the comforting rhythms of church life. But on this day there is no clapping from the Amen corner, no church ladies in decorative hats filing in early to grab their favorite seats, no ushers rushing in with fans to cool parishioners who've been overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. No little girls in their finest dresses scrounging through grandma's purse in search of hard peppermint candies, no little boys negotiating with the serving ladies for an extra piece of fried chicken or another dollop of potato salad after the second sermon.

-- Personnel is policy, and Trump has appointed several people who openly oppose the missions of the agencies they lead. If you look at these Cabinet nominees, they were selected for a reason, and that is deconstruction, Bannon explained at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
The letter was sent to Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).
As with many health policy debates of the day, the rhetoric around this issue is heated and emotional.
But many lawmakers — including 2020 presidential candidates — argue that a general push leftward is long overdue and reflects the broad popularity of many of their positions, from universal health coverage to taxing billionaires at higher rates.
Wagner's support has generated a sense of inevitability around the issue. Even those opposed to expansion say privately that it will be difficult to stop it with two Republican senators on board.
­-- Early voting means that millions are already eligible to cast their ballot. From the AP: In Minnesota, in-person early voting began Jan. 17. Vermont's deadline to mail out its absentee ballots was the same day. Many of the 14 Super Tuesday states will offer some form of early voting between now and mid-February.
A Justice Department inspector general report from last year found that while individuals at the FBI — including Strzok — had demonstrated clear evidence of personal bias against Trump, that bias had not affected the outcome of the investigations into Clinton.
The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation. We take them, we take them.
There was no Obama rule, simply guidance documents concerning laboratory-developed tests from 2014 that never took effect and were withdrawn before Trump took office. The administration suggested, without evidence, that labs were confused because of previous regulatory actions by the Obama administration. But Trump had been president for three years and his administration already had been working with Congress on legislation concerning lab tests. If there was confusion by labs, the administration could have easily taken the action on allowing emergency authorization to create coronavirus tests sooner than it did.
OUCH: The number of people sickened by measles in the first three months of the year has already surpassed the total last year, and it's also the second highest number reported since the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated by U.S. health officials in 2000.
[You can't go to a concert any time soon. Can a pair of wooden speakers bring the show to you?]
-- One reason a lot of Republicans in the suburbs north of Atlanta are willing to give Trump leeway is Price. After representing the district for 12 years, he is still highly respected by the grass roots. He won reelection by 23 points last November, even as Trump edged out Hillary Clinton by just one point.
Paul, however, dismissed the suggestion that Trump could be doing more arena stops or other events to support congressional Republicans.
Barr said he inquired with someone else about whether Rosenstein would prefer a short, one-page opinion, or a more detailed legal analysis. At that point, Graham interrupted with a joke, asking if Barr felt Trump was a one pager kind of guy.
Backers of the so-called heartbeat bill — which didn't get a single Democratic vote in the Legislature during final passage — expressed hope it could challenge Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a fetus is viable, she continues. Conservatives say an influx of right-leaning judicial appointments under President Donald Trump could make it a possibility.
Attorney General William P. Barr said on Feb. 10 that the Justice Department would evaluate material that Rudolph W. Giuliani had gathered from Ukraine. (The Washington Post)
Well, and that the website wasn't intended to be a national tool for identifying testing locations, just for locations in the San Francisco Bay area. And that the site wasn't going to be for the general public until Trump suddenly announced that it would be. And that there still weren't many testing locations, not to mention tests sufficient for a national rollout.
Democrats have insisted that the emergency funding does not need to be paid for with spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. They also object to any plans to redirect money from the Ebola fund.
— But legal experts say it's not likely a Barr confirmation would cause the Justice Department to switch course at this point and start defending the ACA. Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said it would be unusual for DOJ to reverse its position and even if it did, it probably wouldn't change the course of the suit because Democrat-led states are already vigorously defending it. The arguments on the other side have already been made by the Blue states, Somin told me. It seems to me unlikely [Barr] would do things much different from what the Justice Department has already done.
With criticism flying about the electoral college, here's what you need to know about our system for electing the president. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
While the organizers said they are not trying to build a new coalition or launch a counter political agenda, the gathering shows how many key leaders of major institutions are wringing their hands over the state of evangelicalism.

But AFP and other expansion foes contend that legislators who perceive only mild pushback just aren't listening. One legislator in favor of expansion has already drawn a 2019 primary challenger, who declared his candidacy Thursday.
This happens every year to some low-income Americans, but experts say it is particularly widespread now since so many people's livelihoods were disrupted dramatically.
The cause? Emasculation. The prognosis? The afflicted could either become liberals, or take their medicine, man-up and fall in line behind Trump.
WALLACE: Sir? Mr. Trump, I'd like you to respond. You have 30 seconds to respond. But as part of that, could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes, which you say some of it is made in Mexico?
That last point could be an important one if Barr does take charge of the Mueller investigation. If Barr applies that same rationale to the resolution of the Mueller investigation, he might well decide that it is inappropriate for the Justice Department to provide negative information about any individuals who were not charged or accused of crimes by Mueller — leaving some lingering questions unanswered.
In her victory speech, Handel told supporters we need to finish the drill on health care. Chants of Trump! Trump! Trump! erupted before her, my colleagues Robert Costa, Paul Kane and Elise Viebeck report.

Most researchers believe the virus jumped from bats to an intermediary host before evolving into a form transmissible among people. A smaller number of scientists say the possibility it escaped from a lab cannot be ruled out. Some scientists have raised doubts the mission could dismiss this possibility based on interviews with scientists at the WIV.
A U.S. contractor died in a rocket attack at an Iraq base. A Pentagon spokesperson said the contractor suffered a cardiac episode while sheltering and died shortly afterward, the AP reports. At least 10 rockets slammed into the air base housing U.S. and other coalition troops in western Iraq.
Communicate with North Korea's Kim Jong Un about his nuclear program, which would mark a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him. (Trump also did this, to the occasional consternation of said officials.)
There is also distance between McConnell and Trump on Russia. But the Kentucky senator noted that Trump has not actually taken action that runs contrary to Republican orthodoxy. And that allows McConnell to retain hope that Trump, in the end, will hew to mainstream GOP views.
But even people who don't have complicated situations aren't getting aid.
But a bigger factor than that is the mood of Democratic voters, who are not making specific policy demands of candidates so far. At his stops in New Hampshire, Hickenlooper was asked not to take a firm stand on each plank of the Green New Deal; he was asked what he thought of the concept.
But Buttigieg has qualified his position since then. He entered the presidential primary race in January 2019 saying he favored the Medicare-for-all-style system originally envisioned by Sanders. Eleven months prior, he tweeted that he most affirmatively and indubitably supports Medicare-for-all.
— Trump is under increasing pressure to respond to the coronavirus outbreak with a coordinated federal response, especially given concerns over the economic consequences of a global health crisis in an election year, our Post colleagues David Nakamura, Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey report.
McGrath said in the interview that impeachment is rarely what voters most want to discuss with her, and that her message to them is focused far more on kitchen table issues such as health care and education. To the extent that voters do bring up impeachment, she said, you get this feeling of, 'Let's move on.' 
• Extend existing civil rights laws to ban discrimination in employment, housing and other areas against LGBTQ Americans.
2. Democrats have stress fractures, too
They've been responsible for setting an action plan for Trump's first weeks. … The plan has so far produced executive actions weakening Obamacare, beefing up immigration enforcement, and freezing federal hiring — and on preventing refugees and visa-holders from majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. He's telling Trump that he can do everything he said he would do on the campaign trail, said a person close to the administration.
Schumer was standing in front of the court and attacking the justices even before they ruled on the case. Then, according to his office's explanation, he warned them about political pressure that would be brought to bear if they rule the wrong way. He was effectively treating them like advocates rather than interpreters of the law.
Voters have short memories for the unpleasantness around the sausage making, said GOP strategist Alex Conant, speaking to The Fix last week, but ultimately, Republicans and the president will be judged by what happens with the health-care system next year.
The couple intends to cast another ballot for him in November.
In a statement, the company said that the business of selling insurance to individuals remains volatile and cited continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance.
Preexisting conditions: What was used in both of their races was that you don't support people with preexisting conditions, which was the top line issue in those two races and they did not come out strong enough against that and say, 'Yes, we do support people with preexisting conditions when it comes to health care, Ernst said.
Legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think it should be in the future, Gorsuch said. But judges should do none of these things in a democratic society.
On a substantive note, Trump said his administration would submit a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act in early to mid-March and should have a tax reform package around the same time.
More mainstream sites have also stoked theories that Obama was pulling strings. Last Wednesday, the Daily Mail published an interview with an unnamed close family friend, who claimed that former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett had moved into Obama's Kalorama home to help mastermind the insurgency against Trump.
This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.
A recent study on young adults found that the average mortality rate among those between ages 19 and 25 who have contracted diseases have dropped by 3 to 6 percent because of expanded coverage. The study examined the impact of an Obamacare provision that allowed young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until they're 26.
In the past, Trump has joined in calls from Democrats to allow the government to directly negotiate prices with the drugmakers, thereby pushing down prices. It's unlikely — although possible — the president will call for Congress to make such a change in his address planned for next Tuesday.

Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
AHH: Walmart announced it will provide no more than a seven-day supply of first-time acute opioid prescriptions to some customers and will limit dosages to 50 morphine milligram equivalents a day. The stricter opioid policy will be implemented at more than 5,300 Walmart and Sam's Club locations in the United States within 60 days, CNN Money's Danielle Wiener-Bronner reports.
That plan has been criticized by economists on both the left and the right. In December, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that Trump's plan could cost the federal government as much as $9.5 trillion over 10 years.
De Blasio said he was the only person onstage with a black son. I've had to have very serious conversations with him, de Blasio said. We need to have a very different relationship between our police and our community.
Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name, Mr. Trump, but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer. Would you like to respond?
Then Trump won. And suddenly, ascendant Republicans such as Cotton had to confront a difficult question: What now?
On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Paul W. Grimm agreed. He denied the government's motion, noting the time-sensitive nature of the case and that the President publicly stated [the shutdown] may extend for 'months even years.'

According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.

Trump said he did not know that people died of the flu. But his paternal grandfather was a victim of the first wave of the Spanish flu pandemic.
There's lots of excitement among health-care advocates about these hearings, as numerous polls have shown the high cost of drugs is a top concern for American voters. In Protect Our Care's new survey, which was conducted by Democratic polling firm Hart Research, most respondents chose reducing health insurance premiums and cracking down on excessive drug prices as their top two health-care priorities for the new Congress.
-- Paul Ryan seems to have forgotten the first key step in 'I'm Just a Bill,' the 'Schoolhouse Rock' jingle that debuted when the future House speaker was 5 years old in 1975, writes Paul Kane. 'Bill,' a piece of legislation, sits on the Capitol steps and explains to a young boy all the hoops he has to go through, from committee to the House to the Senate to the White House, to become law. But when it comes to immigration, [Ryan] has only one mandate for granting votes on immigration bills: President Trump's support. 'We're bringing bills to the floor that, if they got to his desk, he would sign,' Ryan told reporters Thursday morning. This approach has so far resulted in repeated failure, ensuring that no legislation can actually reach Trump's desk.

The big question, though, is whether they could sell this plan to a public that has overwhelmingly opposed earmarks in the past. I think, led by Trump, it's at least possible.

Secret waiting lists. Veterans dying without seeing a doctor. The way government-run health care harmed our veterans at VA shows the threat government-run Obamacare is to all of us, intoned one television ad aimed at Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who would go on to lose a reelection bid.
I am a single mother who can't afford health insurance under Obamacare, wrote Nomani, who taught at Georgetown from 2008 to 2012. As a liberal Muslim who has experienced, firsthand, Islamic extremism in this world, I have been opposed to the decision by President Obama and the Democratic Party to tap dance around the 'Islam' in Islamic State.
So I announced that I'm running for president. I would …
But Barrett, along with executives from AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and H.D. Smith said they don't think their companies contributed to the opioid crisis, my colleagues Katie Zezima and Scott Higham report.
Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said Trump has remained engaged in the Senate process, including making calls to senators from Paris on Thursday. The White House was also to devote Trump's weekly radio address to the issue Friday. But Short acknowledged that the president's travel schedule has not reflected a significant drive on health care, as officials had said it would.
Although Ryan's job doesn't appear to be in jeopardy, his ability to shepherd the rest of the Republican agenda through his chamber is in doubt.
Pro-life Democrats have all but disappeared on Capitol Hill, and the Democratic orthodoxy today is taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand up to the moment of birth. Dissent from that orthodoxy is not tolerated. For more than 40 years, former vice president Joe Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. He said that as a Catholic, he was personally pro-life and that those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them. But in 2020, that isn't good enough. Biden, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, caved in to the pro-abortion radicals last June, abandoned his principles and embraced taxpayer funding.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said during a said during a Post Live interview yesterday that he doesn't think the filibuster can be eliminated with a day 1 declaration but that once Republicans look like they're operating in bad faith, support for reform or elimination of the filibuster will pick up.
It's too early to tell for sure whether the strategy is working, although a Hill poll released this week gave Bloomberg a 6-point bump, from 5 percent support nationally to 11 percent support. He's fifth in The Washington Post's national poll average.
— Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is set to introduce tomorrow a revised version of his Medicare for all bill, a measure that would establish a single-payer government-run health care program.
— The 2020 Democratic candidates have been touting their policy proposals on social media as much as in their stump speeches, and our colleagues Kevin Schaul and Kevin Uhrmacher put together an in-depth interactive graphic that breaks down what they've been running on so far.
BAIER: Governor, some faith leaders got nervous about that answer. Do gay marriage dissenters have rights?
-- As the first victims of the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre were laid to rest, police revealed that the gunman had planned a third attack. Anna Fifield reports: Sixteen-year-old Hamza Mustafa and his father Khaled Mustafa, who had arrived in New Zealand only a few months ago after escaping the war in Syria, were laid to rest Wednesday, the first victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks to be buried. ... Police Commissioner Mike Bush said Wednesday that the alleged gunman, a 28-year-old Australian who is in custody in Christchurch, was on his way to attack another target when he was apprehended. Bush did not disclose the location of the next target, but the manifesto the alleged shooter posted online made reference to a mosque in Ashburton, about 55 miles south of Christchurch.
Tenney's campaign manager, Raychel Renna, pointed to a Wall Street Journal article about a one-page analysis of the tax plan written by the Treasury Department. Using a GDP growth forecast of 2.9 percent over the next decade, administration officials estimated $1.8 trillion in added tax revenue, which would more than offset the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax cuts.
To do that, Azar and his colleagues said, researchers have studied the geography and demographics of HIV and found that new infections are concentrated in 48 counties, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and seven states — primarily across the South — where a large share of HIV cases are in rural areas. The new initiative will start by focusing on those places.
In the age of Trump, cable news banners have become a medium for presidential fact-checking
The worst black Republican sales pitch is the one Kanye West just fell for: Turning Point USA spokeswoman Candace Owens's one-woman revival of the trope that black Americans are slaves on the Democratic Party plantation. It's shopworn, defies logic, and mainly highlights the shallow politics of those who subscribe to it.
The biggest challenge for Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray has been to identify concrete results. A spreadsheet of nearly 500 data points tracked by City Hall included almost none related to patient outcomes, he writes. City officials cannot point to how many individuals have been connected to treatment after calling a new hotline, for example.
Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo feuded with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo over her, shall we say, controversial efforts to quarantine New Yorkers coming into her state. But she and Cuomo, who has called for more federal aid, are at one on budget matters.
And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine.
4. The road ahead will be rockier
Moderator Chuck Todd set up the question in a way that seemed designed to get a rise out of Biden, saying that President Barack Obama had been forced to choose between health care and climate change as his first priority, settling on health care.
If the threat a Trump presidency posed to the country was not as obvious to many as it should have been in 2016 — partly because few expected Trump to win — the peril a reelected Trump would represent to democratic institutions is obvious across the party. The Democrats' desire to defeat Trump not only fed the surge to Biden after his defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, but also influenced Sanders's own thinking once Biden started winning.
The exchange came at the end of Feinstein's first question period, and the senator said she would ask him later about what was said.
The chintziest of these spots, and in a way the most on-brand with Trump's pre-presidency image, asks viewers of midday cable news to take a phone survey. We need every Trump supporter to pick up the phone now! hyperventilates an announcer. We need the president to know he has the overwhelming support of the American people! The threat: Democrats trying to slow Trump down with a war room. Not very scary, is it? Add in the fact that the ad was created by a Republican who opposed Trump up until he won the nomination, and it comes off more like a grab for money from the Trump brand than a persuasive spot.
1. The arrival of Jones and Smithnon the Hill highlights the extent to which the #MeToo movement has swept Washington. Jones defied the political tilt of his state by defeating Republican Roy Moore, who was accused of making unwanted sexual advances to teenage girls when he was in his 30s, Dave and Sean write. Smith's predecessor, Franken, resigned under pressure from fellow Democrats after allegations emerged that he had touched women inappropriately.
Biden can execute some policies with the stroke of a pen — or at least get the ball rolling by directing HHS to take action.
* REPORT: MANAFORT WORKED TO ADVANCE PUTIN'S INTERESTS: The Associated Press scoops:
Using an unrelated spending bill as leverage, particularly in such a theatrical, high-profile way, helps many Democrats. In the long term, your base sees you as a champion. You've drawn a stark line, just as Republicans did in 2013 when the government shut down for 16 days over their insistence that President Barack Obama yield ground on his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.
But Perriello also has drawn fire from liberals for advocating an amendment to the ACA that would have prevented federal subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion and for winning an A rating from the NRA by, in part, resisting an assault weapons ban. Perriello has since apologized for the abortion vote and now refers to the NRA as a nut-job extremist organization.
— It didn't take long for Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), the latest Democrat to join a growing group of 2020 presidential contenders, to weigh in on the issue of single-payer health care.
Despite covering legislative issues, the Signal has been unable to secure press passes to cover Congress. The gallery's rules prohibit granting passes to reporters who work for organizations whose parent companies are involved in advocacy or to publications that are not financially independent news organizations. The rule is designed to prevent lobbyists or other advocates from securing press accreditation.
The situation is in many ways quite bleak, and Trump and Republicans are going to win a lot of battles. Merely limiting the damage may be the most we can hope for. But a blueprint for meaningful resistance is emerging.
SPEAKER: Hi. My name is Brenda Sparks (ph), and my son is named Eric Zapeda (ph). He was raised by a legal immigrant from Honduras only to be murdered by an illegal in 2011. His murderer never did a second in handcuffs or jail. Got away with killing an American. So I'm voting for trump. And by the way, so is my mother.
Biden administration officials also persuaded lawyers representing minors in a federal consent decree known as the Flores Settlement Agreement to give them a month before pushing for a new ruling in that case.
Gorsuch did a short stint as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department and then was nominated by Bush to the appeals court. He sailed through on a voice vote in the full Senate and took his seat on the Denver-based court in August 2006.
After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the President remains in very good health overall, Trump's doctor, Sean P. Conley, wrote.
President Barack Obama, whom Roberts swore in twice, voted against his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005. So did Biden. And President Donald Trump, to whom Roberts administered the oath in 2017, made clear during the campaign that he considered Roberts a disaster.
What is clear, though, is the policy of pulling apart families at the border is one of the least popular Trump has proposed during his presidency. In June of last year there were several polls demonstrating how unpopular the policy was — even, relatively speaking, among Republicans.
Thomas made clear in an autobiography, My Grandfather's Son, that he did not consider Biden trustworthy.
Ninety percent of our conference was very, very upset with about 10 percent, and I didn't want things being done and said that people would regret, he said. So I sent folks home for the weekend to just kind of soak in what had happened, appreciate the situation and start over and get back to work again.
She was just not receptive. She did not meet our needs. She didn't fight for us, said Howard, a 46-year-old housing counselor who lives in Clinton.
-- A bag of tiny dead birds from China was confiscated from a passenger at Dulles Airport. Agricultural specialists found a package with pictures of pets printed on it – similar to packages of pet treats – that had several tiny, dried birds inside. The passenger said they were cat food but the birds were quickly confiscated because of the potential threat of avian influenza. (Lori Aratani)
Coons then noted the special counsel regulations envision Mueller being fired only for good cause, and asked about the possibility of Trump ordering Barr to withdraw them.
Florida prosecutors have offered to drop charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft and other men accused of soliciting prostitution if they acknowledge they would have been found guilty at trial. It is unclear whether Kraft would accept such a deal, which would also require completing community service and a course on prostitution, given that he denied the charges when they were announced. (Wall Street Journal) West Virginia's attorney general sued the Catholic diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, claiming that church leaders knowingly employed pedophiles and failed to conduct adequate background checks for employees. Patrick Morrisey's lawsuit alleges the diocese and its former bishop Michael J. Bransfield advertised safe environments for children while choosing to cover up and conceal arguably criminal behavior of child sexual abuse. (Michelle Boorstein, Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Tom Jackman) The first drug specifically made to treat postpartum depression was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The medication will cost, on average, $34,000 per patient for a course of treatment before discounts and must be taken intravenously over 60 hours. (Laurie McGinley and Lenny Bernstein) Bayer's Roundup weedkiller caused a man's cancer, a jury found. The San Francisco jury will decide next whether Bayer's Monsanto unit should be held liable. (Wall Street Journal) Mozambique's president said that the death toll in his country from Cyclone Idai could surpass 1,000. Officials in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique have already recorded hundreds of deaths from the devastating storm.
Without true competition and choice in the market, we will never be able to lower health care costs for families and small businesses. This is one more reason why the status quo on health care is unsustainable. The Affordable Care Act has failed to meet the promises that were made to Ohio families, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said in a statement.
DOminioN: What you can't trust to give you accurate election results. (Jonathan Jensen, Baltimore)
Health-care experts said the Utah waiver approval from the Trump administration signals it will appeal the judge's rulings for Arkansas and Kentucky.
They wound up creating a Frankenstein that they couldn't control, said Mizruchi, the University of Michigan sociologist.
We are committing our unique resources — our people, our data and our enduring community ties — to quickly and equitably bring life-saving vaccines to those who need them most, said BCBSA President Kim Keck.
With nine federal departments and several federal agencies going unfunded, here's who and what are impacted by the partial government shutdown. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act gave CVA an opening to go after the failures of big government. The group attacked the early technical problems of the website set up to help people enroll in the new health-care exchanges.
Because of the stupidest rule ever created, called the Hastert rule! Bennet screamed. Named after somebody who is in prison. That has allowed a minority of tyrants in the Congress to control the agenda. (J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Republican speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007, pleaded guilty in 2015 to violating federal banking laws in connection with a hush-money payment and admitted that he had sexually molested teenage boys whom he had coached. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison.)
Today, Biden will start that conversation with lawmakers:
— Gallup has found a majority of Americans believe abortions should be legal in the first trimester, but just 13 percent feel abortion should be legal in the third trimester. Legislation in Virginia and New York making it easier to obtain a late-term abortion has drawn recent attention to questions around fetal viability and how late in pregnancy the procedure should be allowed.
— Drugmakers now coming under fire for potentially blocking generic competition have increased prices by double-digit percentages since 2012, a new Kaiser Health News analysis has found. These drugmakers cost Medicare and Medicaid nearly $12 billion in 2016.
-- A month after Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother were detained for two hours in a Florida airport, the son of the legendary boxer says he was held and questioned for a second time at an airport in Washington. The incident occurred just one day after Ali and his mother spoke to members of a Democratic committee about Trump's travel ban. They think they were targeted because they are Muslim and have Arabic names. (The Independent)
Asked about various border security issues, Barr endorsed the need for some type of barrier on the U.S. boundary. That echoes Trump, who has pushed for a wall on the southern border so intensely that it has left him in a standoff with Democrats and resulted in the shutdown of the government.
McCaul: It's very difficult. But I applaud the administration for the sanctions on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny who is a political dissident. But I would also urge the administration, where I think they've fallen a little short, to implement the mandatory Nord Stream 2 sanctions that Congress passed that will greatly cripple the Kremlin's sources of money. This is the pipeline that goes to Europe, specifically Germany — the Biden administration seems to be a little weak on that issue. If you're really trying to hit Putin hard, you hit him where it counts, and that's in his pocketbook.
-- Trump has cited the death of an American defense contractor as a reason for the missile strikes against Iraqi militias he ordered last month. The man has been identified as an interpreter who was born in Iraq and lived in Sacramento. Aaron C. Davis reports: Nawres Hamid, 33, became a naturalized citizen in 2017, according to his widow. He was the father of two boys, ages 2 and 8, she said. In recent years, as an Arabic interpreter for U.S. forces in Iraq, Hamid was known to decorate his living space with pictures of the children, according to a co-worker. Hamid was killed on Dec. 27 when U.S. authorities say an Iranian-backed militia fired rockets at a military base near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. The attack, which injured several coalition troops, prompted Trump to order missile strikes against Iraqi militias. ... Hamid's death has been a rallying cry for Trump.
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster, he wrote. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump'.
— And here are a few more good reads:
At 9:15 a.m., Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, took his seat in hearing room 106 (moved from room 423). This was followed at 10:15 by the confirmation hearing of Transportation Department nominee Elaine Chao in room G50 (moved from room 253). These accompanied the hearing (continued from the previous day) for Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the nominee for attorney general, but excluded the hearings for nominee for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo, and education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, which had been postponed at the last minute when Senate Democrats argued that the schedule was already a deluge.
There's the lawsuit attempting to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, including the law's protections for patients with preexisting conditions. This is despite President Trump's insistence that he saved said provisions and will always protect them. During an interview in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump also professed his interest in cutting Medicare if he gets elected to a second term. This too defies a campaign promise to leave the program untouched.
On Dec. 9, when The Washington Post reported that intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had sought to undermine Hillary Clinton in the election, the Trump team issued a statement: These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. After information leaked that Trump had been briefed that an unverified dossier alleged Russia had embarrassing information about him, Trump lashed out at the intelligence agencies and asked: Are we living in Nazi Germany? The media simply reported what Trump said about the intelligence community.
Opponents of the move quickly decried the Trump administration's action, arguing that it represented a gutting of Medicaid and the administration's disregard for the poor (which was a big part of the pushback against the failed effort to replace Obamacare), Aaron writes. But assuming such exemptions are included in how states implement their changes — and the Department of Health and Human Services is recommending they are, urging states to mirror the work requirements for food stamps — this seems to be something the vast majority of Americans support.
[Since] the court has never struck down a map for partisan gerrymandering, that ruling could move the needle in a way we have never seen before, The Fix's Aaron Blake writes. Basically any movement in that needle would be in Democrats' favor. In recent years, Republicans have enjoyed a very large edge when it comes to control of the redistricting process ... The GOP won a huge wave election in the 2010 contests, which happened to come just before the once-per-decade census and before state legislatures in most states across the country redrew their congressional and state legislative maps. Republicans used this edge to draw very GOP-friendly maps in big swing states and even some blue-leaning states … And in large part because of those state legislative maps, they retain historic control through today, including complete control of state government in 25 out of 50 states, compared to just seven for Democrats. And that, in turn, would mean they get to draw many of these maps again … So Democrats, he concludes, should be cautiously very happy with this.
During the news conference, Trump alternated between showering the media with scorn and taking a more playful tone.
The initiative includes insurers that belong to America's Health Insurance Plans, the national insurers trade association, and members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, who will aim to get 2 million seniors who live in the most vulnerable communities vaccinated.
CNN senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny:
All the fans of the Indian Mandrake were teary
Congress has approved the sweeping $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.
Monday's ruling from the high court leaves in place a federal appeals court ruling and was issued without comment.
These waivers would give states the ability to remove enrollees or cut certain health care benefits and rates, if they believe they are too costly or unnecessary. Permitting waivers to allow for less spending in return for limited oversight directly contradicts Congress's intent when establishing Medicaid; a safety-net health program, reads the letter signed by Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.) and 35 other Democrats. … The administration should not issue any guidance encouraging block grant waivers, should reject these waivers and the concept of block grants, and urge any state that is considering this misguided policy to commit its energy to implementing Medicaid as Congress intends.
Here are three false claims Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made about former vice president Joe Biden on March 3. (The Washington Post)
I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He says no, but I was there both times for them, thank you very much.
We are going to stand against this with every fiber of our beings, said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), co-chairwoman of the House Pro-Choice Caucus.
Thus did Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) write Sanders's longtime adviser Jeff Weaver on Tuesday night arguing that the goodwill he gets by acting sooner is more leverage [with] Biden than prolonged battle.
There's a tendency -- particularly in media and establishment Republican circles -- to assume that this dredging up of the Clinton past in the rawest possible terms will backfire on Trump. It's gross, and beneath the office for which Trump is running, the argument goes. Plus, do unaffiliated and independent voters -- especially women -- really want to vote for someone who takes this tack on past peccadilloes by the former president?
We will find out Tuesday night whether all of this amounts to a sea change in the primary race. One thing is certain, however: Responsible Democrats have learned from the past and have put country before personal ambition, rational reform above populist rabble-rousing. For that, the entire country should be grateful.
Of the 1.9 million people who received a shot during the first two weeks of vaccination, 21 experienced severe allergic reactions, according to a CDC study released Wednesday. Most of those people had a history of allergic reactions, and 20 of them have fully recovered, The Post's William Wan and Joel Achenbach report. Given the small risk of severe allergic reaction and its treatable nature, the risk of catching the coronavirus and becoming severely ill or dying far outweighs that of a potential allergic reaction, CDC officials said.
The scary thing about all the examples in my book are that, in a different planet other than ours, you might think these are examples of what not to do, Metzl said. Tennessee blocked health-care reform with no backup plan and people started dying. Missouri started to give … everybody could get a gun and what happened, injury and death rates skyrocketed, all these kinds of suicide, partner violence, police shooting, etc. Kansas cut at schools, and people started to really suffer.
And for Republicans in moderate districts — 23 of them represent districts that voted for Hillary Clinton last year, according to Daily Kos Elections — that makes it a much tougher calculus.
Gillibrand officially announced she's in and is headed to Michigan, Iowa and Nevada this week, Beto O'Rourke went for a literal run, Cory Booker packed some rooms in rural Iowa and Pete Buttigieg went viral for his bookish language skills. Amy Klobuchar celebrated St. Patrick's Day with Iowa's Linn County Democrats, and Elizabeth Warren headed down South to Memphis. Today, Warren will go to Mississippi for a few stops in the Mississippi Delta followed by a CNN town hall in Jackson.
Klobuchar, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said the bill could encourage drugmakers to hold off on price hikes if they know there is a chance for competition in the market.
Healey's office is planning to oppose the motion.
Any day now, the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to finalize a rule representing its latest effort to crack down on abortion providers. Under the proposed regulation, abortion providers couldn't receive federal family-planning dollars — a move that could cost Planned Parenthood, which serves 41 percent of the 4 million patients getting care under the Title X program, as much as $60 million a year.
Republicans kept the Senate. Donald Trump won the presidency. A few months later, President Trump nominated what mainstream conservatives considered a fantastic choice, conservative Judge Neil M. Gorsuch.
Until Monday, Gallego was widely expected to run, and opposition research about Kelly's unformed positions on some liberal issues had been circulating in D.C. and Arizona.
-- DeNeen L. Brown examines Washington's modern divides through one street: MLK Avenue. Near the corner where Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue meets Malcolm X Avenue in Southeast Washington, a local artist has painted a mural of King on the brick wall of a convenience store. … But the I Have a Dream mural … has been marred with graffiti. … In some ways, the defaced mural captures all the promise and pain of MLK Avenue, which stretches 4.3 miles from Congress Heights to Anacostia, where the street ends near Good Hope Road. … Most of the District has recovered from 1968's destruction. But much of MLK Avenue remains plagued by poverty, crime and a hunger for change that many residents say has been too slow to arrive.
KELLY: Sean was the next day after Bill.
The company, and others, must submit an exhaustive application to the FDA by May 12 to makes the case for why their vapes should continue to be sold. An employee told BuzzFeed that at least half the company was contributing to the application.
The two bills are not part and parcel. The Supreme Court could decide to hear one and not the other. But decisions on either measure from the highest court in the land could have ripple effects around the country because other states have made similar attempts.
House leaders see Price, the House Budget Committee chairman and an orthopedist, as a reliable partner. But it is unclear how quickly he might be confirmed: The Senate Finance Committee has yet to set confirmation hearings, and Democrats have vowed to undertake a no-holds-barred blitz on Price's record.
-- Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he will not protest if tax cuts are not offset by new spending cuts or new streams of revenue in tax reform, a rare shift from the leader of the House Freedom Caucus. I think there's a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset, he said on ABC's This Week. Does it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no.
Mayhew, long a critic of expansion under the ACA, was praised by CMS administrator Seema Verma in a Friday statement. I am excited for Mary as she transitions to serve Governor-elect DeSantis and the people of Florida, Verma said. I appreciate her efforts at CMS and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she uses her many talents to help the state of Florida create a healthcare system that serves the needs of its citizens.
-- The White House is exploring how to loosen or bypass Obama-era counterterrorism rules intended to prevent civilian deaths from drones, commando raids and other missions outside conventional war zones such as Afghanistan and Iraq, using operations in Yemen and Somalia as test runs. The New York Times' Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report: Already, [Trump] has granted a Pentagon request to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an 'area of active hostilities' where looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the largest-ever series of American airstrikes targeting Yemen-based Qaeda militants.… Mr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such battlefield-style zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the Qaeda-linked group the Shabab, [officials] said. Inside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the Obama-era rules.
The proposed changes to public charge policy in the U.S. are not final, but they are already causing significant harm, the sheet reads. Fear and confusion - known as the chilling effect - are causing people to disenroll from programs or forgo benefits to which they are eligible. The impact is far-reaching, given that one in four children in the U.S. has at least one foreign-born parent.
After his Supreme Court clerkship, Gorsuch joined the D.C. law firm Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Figel, where he developed a taste for litigation and eventually became a partner. He helped secure what his former law partner Hansen said was the largest antitrust award in history and won praise for his courtroom style.

Particularly on Betsy DeVos' OGE paperwork, it was submitted 36 days ago on December 12. She has responded to all follow up questions in a timely way including over weekends and the holiday. This process is typical, it's a back and forth that occurs to clarify questions that come up on the process.
Why on earth, said one Senate Republican aide requesting anonymity to speak candidly, would they get rid of the filibuster when it risks putting them on the receiving end of Trump's ire?
The House is set to vote Friday on a measure that would begin the budget reconciliation process, which ultimately would allow Republicans to repeal Obamacare without securing cooperation from Democrats who have vowed to block any major changes to the law.
That allowed Warren, a seasoned debater, to go straight to her stump speech. She argued that the economy is doing great for large corporations and the wealthy, but that most workers aren't feeling the prosperity.
We've had very candid conversations about that, McConnell said. And as you can see, my advice has not made a bit of difference.
-- The day will start warm in Washington but later get chillier. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Morning may bring a few showers and the day's high temperatures. Mid-50s north and west of town, mid-60s possible south and east of town — with the Beltway area in between. Skies slowly clear, and winds pick up — perhaps gusting above 30 mph. Blustery and chillier air moves in as the afternoon wears on. Wind chills around 40 degrees are possible by the commute home. A cold front moving through midday is responsible for all of this!
It isn't difficult to understand why Speaker Pelosi and most Democratic Members of the House favor this approach over embracing calls by some to push ahead with a disruptive, costly and unpopular Medicare for all-style proposal, the group's executive director Lauren Crawford Shaver wrote in a memo to be released this morning, pointing to the ACA's expansion of coverage to roughly 20 million Americans.
The still-unvaccinated population includes 36 percent of people over age 75 and 54 percent of people ages 65 to 75, according to data shared yesterday by President Biden's coronavirus task force.
Yale New Haven Health keeps a list of people who are already signed up for vaccinations but might be flexible to get an earlier slot. But sometimes the process can be as simple as flagging down a passerby, which is what happened on New Year's Day in D.C. when a supermarket pharmacist approached David MacMillan, a 31-year-old law student, while he was shopping for food, and asked if he would be interested in a dose of unused vaccine that would otherwise go to waste. It was random. I wasn't expecting it. I wasn't going to be eligible for the vaccine for months, said MacMillan.
1. The big problem is that the GOP is divided on immigration
-- With five days until early voting begins in Nevada, the campaigns are still in the dark about the state's new caucus process. From the Nevada Independent: Campaigns have been told that the Nevada State Democratic Party won't be using the same app and vendor that were in part responsible for bungling the results of Iowa's caucus last week, that the party won't be using any app at all, and that what the party does plan to use is best described as a 'tool' or 'calculator.' Beyond that, aides aren't really sure what's in store for the state's Feb. 22 Democratic caucus. They don't know how early voting, which was originally supposed to take place on an app on an iPad, is set to work. They don't know how those votes are going to flow back to early voters' home precincts to be counted alongside their neighbors preferences just as if they were there on Caucus Day. (A second app was supposed to accomplish that function.) They also don't know how the Caucus Day results will be transmitted to the party.
Would you rather have me get involved in the process and try to drive it as conservative as possible? Wagner later asked rhetorically, as he confirmed his remarks to The Washington Post.
It's made my blood boil, he said.
The policy change — as with other Trump administration attempts to cut Medicaid — will almost certainly be challenged in court. It's also quite unpopular, as you may recall from the last time the GOP proposed it as part of Obamacare repeal efforts in 2017. The backlash the idea received then is presumably why the Trump administration has rebranded block grants with a new Orwellian name: the Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative.
RUBIO: Let's see if he answers it.
-- Trump keeps saying that the coronavirus could miraculously go away this spring. Experts say that's not how diseases work. Hawkins reports for our live blog: Trump first raised the idea in a tweet last week, saying the Chinese government's efforts to control the virus would succeed 'as the weather starts to warm and the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone.' He made a similar prediction in a rally Monday, suggesting that the outbreak could subside 'by April.' 'You know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away, that's true,' he told an audience in New Hampshire. Experts said that's wishful thinking at best: While it's true that respiratory viruses tend to follow seasonal patterns, there's no telling what course the novel coronavirus will take. 'This virus can do anything it wants,' Allison McGeer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told The Washington Post last week.
Our economic policies have left young, working families behind at a time when our marriage and childbirth rates are falling, Rubio said in a statement provided to Health 202. It is time to realign our economic policies in support of American families, which is why I am proud to re-introduce the New Parents Act.
Both women worked at the sweeping agency during the Obama administration.
TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say we're gonna protect. What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.
Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?
On Wednesday, as if on cue after the first of two Democratic debates in Detroit, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar held a call with reporters, outlining steps that might eventually lead to the importation of some lower-cost drugs from Canada — an idea supported by Trump but opposed by many Republicans.
Fred Hiatt: So your solution is?
While we should obviously hope that Trump retains as much emotional balance as possible in making difficult decisions, particularly amid crises, we can also hope that he remains distracted enough by the loud noises in his head to undermine his own worst designs.
Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, said that the focus should remain on the 7 million people who receive the subsidies and the urgency as plans face deadlines over the next two months.
The debt ceiling must be raised, McConnell told reporters.
Mercy says its virtual ICU care program — dubbed vICU — has led to 35 percent lower mortality rates and 30 percent shorter hospital stays for ICU patients than predicted across its network. A spokeswoman also said the virtual care program has led to a 40 percent reduction in morality from sepsis and a nearly 90 percent reduction in patients progressing from severe sepsis to septic shock over 24 hours, because of the close monitoring of vital signs.
There are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.

Charles Lane: So I wanted to ask, because it's not just the $10,000 or, sorry, the $12,000 a year or $24,000 for a couple, it's the pay-for of that and also the terms and conditions. So I've looked at various estimates of how this would end up getting paid for. And I have to tell you, most of the estimates I've read suggests that your pay-fors are going to fall well short of the $2.8 trillion a year that it would cost to do that. So that's one question about it.
While the general idea of action is popular, specific steps can generate backlash. During our interview, I noted that the mass yellow vest protests in Paris over the past few months started because of public outcry over France imposing a new tax to fight climate change. Inslee emphasized that this is partly why he does not advocate carbon taxes.

Key excerpt: Jared [Kushner] and Ivanka had made an earnest deal between themselves: If some time in the future the time came, she'd be the one to run for president (or the first one of them to take the shot). The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton, it would be Ivanka Trump.
At a Bethesda Marriott, a crowd of 300 heard Van Hollen praise Edwards for being a strong advocate for Democratic Party values and priorities.
Most of the 700 or so people at the Friday meeting were opposed to stricter standards, our Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Kristen Millares Young report.
In addition to all the other electoral components shaping up against them, Republicans running for reelection to Congress don't have a ton to brag about. They failed to make good on a nearly decade-long campaign promise to repeal Obamacare. They rewrote the tax code for the first time in 30 years, but Trump's tariffs plan risks undermining any economic benefit voters might feel from the tax bill. They did manage to undo a dozen or so Obama-era regulations, but those efforts have since stalled, and deregulation isn't the sexiest thing to campaign on.
The debates will be capped at 20 candidates. That might end up being higher than the number of declared candidates, especially once lesser-known Democrats such as Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson are counted. But that's the rule.
After the Civilian Service Recognition Act passed the House, 425 to 0, and subsequently passed the Senate, Mr. Hanna was the only Republican member of Congress invited to the White House for a private Oval Office signing ceremony.
Barr said in the middle of June 2017, he was approached by David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Friedman, Barr said, wanted to talk about Trump's legal defense.
I feel I'm in a position to be independent, Barr told Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). As attorney general, he said, you have to be willing to spend all of your political capital and have no future. I feel like I'm in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences.
The center also found that drug companies and PhRMA together employed 882 lobbyists, two-thirds of whom formerly worked for Congress or federal agencies. And PhRMA has deployed a series of ads — part of its Go Boldly campaign — touting the innovative but expensive medicines its members have developed in recent years.
SPICER: I think you're going to see an enormous outpouring of support and interest in coming to this. We've been overwhelmed by the number of people that want to attend -- attend this inauguration and be part of it in any of numerous ways.
-- Democrats used a significant chunk of time on Thursday to preemptively defend the Bidens, who they expect Trump's lawyers to attack when they get the floor: Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine, Seung Min Kim, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. But Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump's defense team. … Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn't focus on Biden's actions toward Ukraine until 2019 … She also referenced a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) … and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden's desire to see [prosecutor Viktor] Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy … As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter. …
On the other side of the GOP-Trump divide, House Republican leaders once respected for their bipartisanship in delicate intelligence investigations have picked up the sword for Trump on Russia. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) released a memo accusing the FBI of political bias in its spying on a former Trump foreign policy adviser. Legal experts, the Trump-appointed head of the FBI and Democrats all said the memo was severely cherry-picked to make the Russia investigation look bad and Trump's arguments against it look good.

As far as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is concerned, it's not the end of the world if Republicans can't pass health-care legislation, especially if that legislation could leave 22 million fewer people uninsured over the next decade.

— And here are a few more good reads:
There are utterances coming out of this [Trump] administration about significant adjustments that may take place in Medicaid reimbursements, Norment said. What we have chosen to do is undertake a fiscally conservative and responsible approach.
The Cares Act also provides emergency money to states to fund another $600 a week in payments — on top of regular weekly payments — from the time a worker lost his or her job until July 31. It also funds an additional 13 weeks of payments from states, which typically cap unemployment benefits between 12 and 30 weeks. (Here's a map which shows how many weeks of unemployment your state offers.) In other words, if the economy remains sour for so long that jobs aren't available past the time your state would normally cut off benefits, there's money from the federal government that will keep assistance flowing.
Fast-forward 5½ years. One might have been excused for thinking that the Democrats' fevered hatred for Citizen Trump and their 'Trump Derangement Syndrome,' would have broken by now, the now-former president's lawyers wrote in a 78-page brief, released ahead of this week's impeachment trial in the Senate.
We have also targeted constituency media outlets to ensure we are explaining the details of the American Rescue Plan and reaching communities where they are, the official said.
Surfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, Teles explains. There's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. The judges need scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, Teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.
— A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
-- During the 2016 campaign, the National Enquirer sent any Trump-related stories to Michael Cohen before they were published — a highly unusual practice that speaks to the nature of Trump's friendship with AMI's chief executive, David Pecker, and underscores the support Trump was offered by the tabloid magazine throughout his presidential bid. Sarah Ellison reports: Although the company strongly denies ever sharing such material before publication, [three] individuals say the sharing of material continued after Trump took office. 'Since Trump's become president and even before, [Pecker] openly just has been willing to turn the magazine and the cover over to the Trump machine,' said one of the people with knowledge of the practice. The Enquirer's alleged sharing of material pre-publication with Trump's attorney … also intersects with a subject that federal prosecutors have been investigating since earlier this year: Cohen's efforts to quash negative stories about Trump during the campaign.
I think we will pass a Medicare-for-all single-payer system, and I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office, he said.
Buttigieg and Bloomberg attacked the senator for his comments about Fidel Castro's Cuba in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday night. Sanders said Castro deserved praise where it was due, including for a massive literacy program. During the dying days of the Cold War, Sanders indulged a fascination with far more disruptive and divisive strains of a socialist ideology he has embraced throughout his adult life, Griff Witte reports. Returning home from visits to some of the United States' most avowed enemies, Sanders offered some criticism but also plenty of praise in Vermont community television recordings. … Now, Sanders's comments are coming back to life as opponents say his warm feelings toward his hosts decades ago make him vulnerable to attack and reveal a soft spot for left-wing despots.
But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
Unfortunately, it hasn't taken long — even by Washington's standards — for talking points with a dubious relationship to reality to start circulating among defenders of the status quo, Verma wrote.
During a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump also said his administration was working with Google to build a screening website for Americans looking for information about testing. Still, within hours, several discrepancies emerged between the White House and Google versions of what the site will be able to do, where it will do it and when.
Forty-eight states -- minus New York and Minnesota -- compensated for the loss of CSRs by silver loading, which meant they increased premiums on the second cheapest plan available under Obamacare. That didn't harm most consumers because when premiums increased, so did government subsidies. But this workaround wasn't feasible for New York and Minnesota residents because most ACA enrollees eligible for subsidies get their insurance from those states Basic Health Programs.
KASICH: ... The reason it happens...
On Monday, Saccone seemed to lose it. President Trump's opponents, he asserted, have a hatred for our country. … They have a hatred for God. This was not the voice of a confident candidate.
Obamacare was built for these individual insurance buyers, who are guaranteed comprehensive coverage that includes those 10 essential health benefits if they buy in the Obamacare marketplace. Over time, new, cheaper association plans might draw healthy people out of the well-regulated Obamacare market and into the more loosely regulated world of association plans. The more healthy insurance buyers exit the Obamacare system, the higher premiums would have to rise in the system's marketplace to offset the medical costs of those who remain. Many people who need coverage — or who simply want comprehensive policies — would have to pay more for it.
Trump and his administration are trying to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans — again, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said on Twitter, one of several tweets by presidential candidates hitting Trump on health care. We must fight back again with everything we've got. And in 2020, we need to elect a president who will make health care a right.
The plan assumes that a GOP-led tax regime would eliminate all Obamacare taxes, which are expected to bring in around $600 billion over a decade. It also assumes that a package of expiring tax breaks and benefits would be made permanent.
Because the plans would be available to higher-income people, they could come with copays and deductibles, but premiums would be capped at 9.5 percent of a family's income. Klobuchar suggested this incremental approach -- versus a total Medicare-for-all-style overhaul -- would be the fastest and most realistic way of achieving universal coverage
OUCH: A group of more than 300 medical experts sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying the landmark guidelines from the agency for opioid use are having a detrimental impact on patients with chronic pain.
Industry view: The impact on care for seniors would be devastating, Chip Kahn, president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, said in a statement to The Post. Hospitals are less and less able to cover the cost of care for Medicare patients, it is no time to gut Medicare.
She is very calm and very measured, said Dan Mendelson, whose firm Avalere Health employed Brooks-LaSure from 2003 to 2007. She doesn't react too quickly and I think that kind of thoughtfulness will be really useful given the range of issues they have to deal with right now.
So, why is she in the loser column? Because she did nothing in the debate to slow the momentum that Sanders is building in Iowa and New Hampshire. Aside from guns, where Clinton scored a clean win against Sanders, she was unable to effectively cast him as a pie-in-the-sky idealist and herself as the only person who could truly fight for — and win on — Democratic priorities.
Democrats generally agree that the tax system is broken, but the two sides have been deadlocked for years over how far rates should be cut and how much revenue the government should receive from income tax, among other critical issues.
Every chip away at unanimity makes tax overhaul tougher. Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio), a senior Ways and Means member, says some of his constituents back border adjustment while others are worried. . . . Rep. Pat Meehan (R., Pa.), says refiners in his district rely on imported oil and that he is arguing for an exception. It puts us at a remarkable competitive disadvantage, he says. . . . At least seven GOP senators have expressed concerns about border adjustment, including Utah's Mike Lee, Arkansas's John Boozman, Georgia's David Perdue and Texas' John Cornyn. Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said last week he had questions about border adjustment and that the Senate would put its own stamp on the tax bill. I worry that consumers, my Kansas constituents, are the ones who pay the tax, says Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.). He is concerned the world might respond in ways that hurt his state's wheat growers and airplane makers. I assume you get into a battle with other countries, he says, and it affects the exporters.

Take this comment from a recent meeting Trump held with House Republicans, via my colleague James Hohmann:
A vocal group of experts has pushed for officials to consider giving as many people as possible the first dose of the two-shot regimen, even if it means risking a delayed second dose. President-elect Joe Biden has announced his incoming administration will take this approach, sending all doses out the door as quickly as possible instead of holding half back.

At the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump, Democrats continued to make their case for abuse of power while Republicans zeroed in on the Bidens. (The Washington Post)
Assisting the instruction are two ironies: First, the politics of health care in Nevada pit Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), tribune of democratic socialism, against the unionized working class. Second, it is Sanders — not labor, or the Democratic rivals, desperate for union support, who are trashing him in the name of pragmatism — who's closer to the right policy answer.
4. Protect dreamers: Four months after Trump ended the program that protects young undocumented immigrants, and then tossed it to Congress to deal with, lawmakers haven't figured out what to do.
Mr. Hanna, a licensed pilot who flew seaplanes, engaged in civic and philanthropic work before making an unsuccessful congressional run in 2008. Two years later, he defeated the two-term incumbent, Michael Arcuri, in a rematch.
Title X funds can't be used for abortions. But the new rules, finalized in August 2019, ban grantees from referring for abortions and require clinics to establish and maintain physical separation from the provision of abortion. HHS is expected to reverse those regulations, probably by cutting short the current grant cycle and announcing a new funding opportunity.
Coons pressed further. What if Trump ordered him to withdraw the regulations and fire Mueller. Would Barr resign, as Richardson did?
Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.
The president-elect made the following statement, quote, Jared has been a tremendous asset and a trusted adviser throughout the campaign and the transition, and I'm proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration. He has been successfully incredible (sic) in both business and now in politics. He will be an invaluable member of my team as I set and execute an ambitious agenda of putting the American people first.

Bill O'Reilly has strong views on his right to own guns to defend himself under the Second Amendment.
Secure the borders, deliver the mail, and keep us safe — that's it, Cruz said of the role of government. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the president the power to be the bathroom police for this country.
Shalala: We haven't completely closed the doughnut hole in terms of drugs. There's bipartisan support to do that. My mother and aunts used to yell at me about that doughnut hole — why did we do a doughnut hole? And I'd say, 'Well, it was a budget decision … they didn't have enough money so they left a hole in the middle.' And they thought that was the stupidest explanation. I mean how do you explain it to someone that's 92? My aunt said to me, 'But I pay my taxes.' (laughter)
It's hard to see where we can be successful, and it leads to a lot of questions as to whether Republicans can govern, even with a Republican in the White House, he said.
— Manafort trial in Sept. The Post's Spencer S. Hsu: Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort will face trial no sooner than September, the judge hearing his case indicated after an hour-long hearing Tuesday in which prosecutors and defense attorneys sparred over his continuing house arrest and a separate lawsuit challenging the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Prosecutors told the court Friday that they intended to ask for a May 14 trial date for Manafort, 68, and his former business partner, Rick Gates, 45, whose Oct. 30 indictments on fraud, conspiracy and money laundering counts were the first disclosed in Mueller's probe of Russian influence in U.S. political affairs.
What does all this tell us?
Richards pointed to a real divide between ideologically driven conservatives and more-pragmatic Republicans who are more wary of a divisive fight — including, she suggested, the president-elect.
Politicians usually pay a price when they ignore their constituents, said Lorenz Isidro, spokesman for AFP's Virginia chapter. Our activists have been contacting their representatives, and to say otherwise is outrageous and denigrates their efforts. . . . Our activists are engaged as ever and are ready, willing and able to hold these folks accountable.
I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried — until now.
This week, the FDA said it is in the process of opening the grant application to other institutions. Several health policy experts had expressed favoritism concerns about the initial no-bid proposal, raising questions about what made the Duke center uniquely qualified to do the work, which involves convening discussions with drug companies, health-care providers and patient groups to discuss key issues in the drug approval process, Carolyn writes.
Time and again, she was boxed into defending a status quo that the American public — Democrats and Republicans alike — is dissatisfied with. This tweet from the New York Times's Nicholas Kristof perfectly captures that sentiment:
Republicans see the outcome of this week's trial as a reflection of Trump's influence in their party.
Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.

-- Putting the lawyers on trial: Senators plan to use their chance to pose written questions to press the counsels from both sides about their personal involvement at pivotal moments in the process. Karoun Demirjian, Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade preview what to expect: Senators have up to 16 hours, divided over two days beginning Wednesday, to pose questions to either the House managers or the Trump defense team. The lawyers will be given up to five minutes to respond to each query. Each side faces a balancing act in its allotted time. Senate Republicans must weigh the desires of moderates, who want to ask factual questions that could help determine whether to vote to call witnesses, against those of Trump loyalists, who want to pose questions that will allow defense lawyers to double down on attacks against Democrats …
Obviously, we're going to have a vote one way or the other, but if we don't pass something and we go into '18, you know, it's on us to try and get this fixed, said Thune on Monday. Asked Tuesday whether he would hold a vote without having the 50 votes necessary to pass it, McConnell would not say.
But close to 5 million homeowners with loans valued at $3.7 trillion are not covered by federal moratoriums, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. Some states, including California and New York, have paused foreclosure and eviction that would also apply to those borrowers. In other states, homeowners may have to negotiate arrangements with their mortgage provider. Regulators are encouraging banks and other mortgage providers to simply extend the life of the mortgage to make up for any missed payments brought on by joblessness.
But cultural identity is fed by many factors besides race, and understanding this complexity is very important if the Democrats hope to win back the Oval Office and Congress. Failure to appreciate the legitimate grounds for resentment by populist voters is a general failure of liberals everywhere, from Turkey and Hungary to Britain and the United States, and one of the reasons they keep losing elections.

But now, in the health-care bill's raw aftermath, Republican leaders are learning that the Trump presidency is doing little, if anything, to heal their party.
Another Clinton voter, 28-year-old Erika Williams, stopped to talk as she walked into a hair salon. When asked how Trump was doing as president, she scoffed. What frustrated her? Trump's position on DACA and the wall — but, more broadly, how he handled his position.
It's not as if we haven't begged our Republican colleagues to be part of the process. We wouldn't be doing this if we hadn't already been shut down in every way possible by the Republicans, Murphy added.
Any day now, Steil is expected to announce his candidacy and almost immediately become the frontrunner. He has already locked down a powerful state GOP donor. The fact that Steil has never held public office before could help him separate himself from Ryan, should that become necessary.
Within the context of the GOP's broader repeal effort — and this week's tumultuous town hall meetings around the country, at which lawmakers have been confronted by constituents scared of losing their health coverage — Republicans' ideas for Medicaid's future have drawn less public attention. Yet their proposals would significantly remake one of the nation's largest entitlement programs, which serves more than 74 million lower-income Americans and accounts for half the additions to the insurance rolls that the ACA has brought about.
McConnell told reporters last week there could be changes to the disapproval resolution before it hits the floor, likely later this week. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is spearheading legislation that would amend the 1976 law Trump has invoked for his national emergency, mandating that such a declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to approve it, according to my colleagues Erica Werner and Seung Min Kim.
But policy issues were largely overshadowed by Tanden's history of sending caustic tweets, targeting both Republicans and figures on the left, including Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
The Medicaid idea referenced by Klobuchar is from a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who reintroduced his measure just last week. It would allow states to start selling a government-backed Medicaid plan on their individual insurance marketplaces, which people could purchase with the help of Obamacare premium subsidies.
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) called it a heavy lift. I think everybody knows…We sort of tested the limits of what we can do in the Senate last year. And we're one vote down from where we were then, he told Burgess.
The IRS isn't the only agency having challenges. The Treasury Department, under Mnuchin, is working to oversee a sprawling rescue — including the IRS — even while its own senior ranks are depleted.
Moderate Democrats should consider what stories will likely come out in 2022 as they run for reelection. It won't be hard for reporters to find examples of wealthy people who used government money on lavish expenditures or state governments that used federal money to pay off politically influential interest groups. There's also the possibility of an inflationary effect from throwing unnecessary cash into the economy. Inflation is always a case of too much money chasing too few goods and services. The U.S. economy is already awash in cash from prior relief measures. A poorly targeted additional $1.9 trillion will simply add to those pressures once the pandemic-related regulations that are artificially suppressing consumer demand are removed.
It is highly unusual for the Department of Justice not to defend duly enacted laws, which the Affordable Care Act certainly was, Collins said. This decision to even go more broadly in failing to defend the law is very disappointing.
Republicans have said a sales tax approved as part of the ballot initiative might not be enough to pay for the state's 10 percent share of expansion, even though the tax rate was set specifically to cover the state's estimated costs based on an analysis by the governor's Office of Management and Budget.
Mr. MacKenzie currently serves as CEO of BHP Billiton. Mr. Nasser serves as the chairman of the company's board of directors. And Mr. Healy is the chief external officer -- excuse me -- chief external affairs officer and chief legal counsel.
The White House has already moved to divert $589 million from the Ebola early response fund to Zika, and most Democrats say that moving any additional money could make it harder to respond if Ebola re-emerges.
Trump's extracurricular activities are drawing growing criticism. As the president's focus has regularly drifted away from the crisis at hand, he has struggled to answer questions about whether he took the viral outbreak seriously enough during its crucial early stages. As the death toll has spiked in the United States, reports have surfaced suggesting that he did not.
Charles Lane, editorial writer: So if I could, I'd like to ask a few things about the basic income or the Freedom Dividend proposal. Starting with the premise, which is that technology is about to sort of so destabilize the job market, wipe out all these jobs, that you're gonna have to have that. I mean, I'm not an expert on trucking, but I spent last night reading about three hours about the future of autonomous trucking. And it frankly just seems a lot, lot more of a long-range problem than you're describing. I mean, I'm only zeroing in on that because you've emphasized the fact that it's where not college people get their jobs. And quite apart from doing nothing about it, government is deeply involved as the regulator of transportation. And until the Congress signs off on those trucks, they're not going to hit the road. So I'd like to hear you talk a little bit more about why you're so sure that this sort of displacement is not going to work the way it has in the past. For example, even the retail clerks who are being technologically unemployed by Amazon, may now be working in one of Amazon's warehouses, just to cite a for-instance. So be a little more specific about why that long-range phenomenon, whereby technological unemployment kind of corrects itself, is not going to happen.
I like a full-bodied high, he told her.
TRUMP: Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal.
For Justice Roberts to follow the right wing's deliberate misinterpretation of what Sen. Schumer said, while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices [Sonia] Sotomayor & [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg last week, shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes, Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said, referring to Roberts's statement in his confirmation hearing that he felt a judge's role was to call balls and strikes.
Even Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (R-Augusta), a moderate who has voted for expansion in the past, has said he does not like the particulars of the House plan, including a tax on hospitals to cover the state's 10 percent share. And so Senate Republicans, who lead that chamber 21 to 19, passed a budget that did not include Medicare expansion.
Democrats need to avoid the trap Republicans fell into when they controlled the House, appeasing their base with repeated votes to repeal Obamacare. But the GOP never did the hard work of crafting politically feasible legislation to replace it -- and their efforts to repeal and replace the ACA when they had the chance failed spectacularly.
A border influx could imperil the Biden administration's efforts to pass an immigration bill this year focused on legalizing 11 million undocumented immigrants — many of whom have lived in the United States for years, even decades.
First published in 1939, the Alcoholics Anonymous book has stats most authors only dream of: more than 30 million copies sold, Gillian notes. Translated into 67 languages. In 2012, the Library of Congress ranked it No. 10 in its top 25 'Books That Shaped America.'  The sale on Saturday came after a year of legal wrangling, as AA's publishing wing tried unsuccessfully to halt the auction.
In contrast, Romney's approval rating has surged among Democrats and Democratic leaners. It's at 56 percent — more than twice his approval among his party's base.
Trump on Flynn firing: 'I asked for his resignation' (Reuters)
While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.
— Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson have agreed to settle more than 25,000 lawsuits in the United States over claims the top-selling blood thinner Xarelto causes uncontrollable bleeding.
Trump has sought spending cuts in the past, only to back down immediately during negotiations with Democrats. … Proposing the cuts again, on the eve of the New Hampshire Democratic primary, gave Democrats a fresh target to attack. 'The old cliche is that a budget is a moral document,' [Sanders] said in a statement. 'What kind of unbelievable moral framework allowed this White House to propose $182 billion in cuts to nutrition assistance from needy families, when nearly one in seven households with children are food insecure?' … Even some of Trump's staunchest allies criticized his sharp cuts for domestic agencies, such as the Agriculture Department, which he is targeting for an 8 percent overall reduction. That was an indication that the budget will get a cold shoulder on Capitol Hill from lawmakers of both parties.
Congressional Republicans have been struggling for months to resolve one of the most vexing problems in their tortuous effort to replace the Affordable Care Act: What to do about the generous federal funding for states that broadened their Medicaid programs under the law, while not shortchanging the 19 states that balked at expansion?
With the ban now in place, the FDA will monitor if flavored cartridges are for sale on shelves or online, CNN reports.
But, to O'Malley's credit, he turned the corner on getting ignored and by the end of the debate was downright likable. Will it change anything about his minuscule support in Iowa and New Hampshire? No. But kudos to him. He did well in an impossible situation.
Because cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger known as a blockchain, they also provide a promising avenue for cash welfare and other means-tested programs — ensuring that public assistance ends up in the hands of those it is intended to help. Even a 10 percent improvement in the efficiency of welfare payments would make an enormous difference for those struggling to make ends meet. Biden has a historic opportunity to open up the financial system to those it has excluded. He should take it. Avik Roy is president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.
-- A Gallup poll published Thursday shows that a record-high 75 percent of Americans, including majorities across all party groups, think immigration is a good thing for the U.S., up from 71 percent last year. Just 19 percent of the public considers immigration a bad thing. When asked more specifically about legal immigration, 84 percent said it's a good thing.
Candidates have trouble following instructions: It's hard to pick just one issue that is the most important when you're running for president. The 10 candidates onstage proved that when asked what would be their hands-down first priority if elected.
It's true that spending on pharmaceutical products has been rising just about everywhere in the past three decades, as specialty medicines for complex or rare, chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and H.I.V. have become more widely available. But in the United States, average spending on prescription drugs exceeds $1,000 per person per year — a hefty figure compared to, say, the United Kingdom, where it's $497, or even Switzerland, where it's $783.
When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
In my opinion … yes, he does have the power to pardon a family member — but he would then have to face the fact that he could then be held accountable for abusing his power, Barr said. In the absence of a violation of a statute … then he'd be accountable politically.
Besides that report, Barr said, the attorney general is responsible for notifying and reporting certain information upon the conclusion to the investigation.
The court's decision, if affirmed, will deprive millions of non-elderly Ohioans and Montanans of coverage of pre-existing conditions, they write. It will also negatively affect countless others who organized their affairs in reliance on the Act's many unrelated provisions. To be sure, the fact that a ruling has negative consequences does not mean it is wrong. Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall. But the District Court's ruling is wrong, and its errors threaten harm to millions of people in the Buckeye and Treasure states.
If Bloomberg has any hope of competing seriously for 2020 nomination, he'll need to create a large groundswell of support — and soon. He's skipping the first four state primaries, instead hinging his campaign on the 25 states that will award nearly two-thirds of all delegates between March 3 and March 18.
We urge you to make sure that consumers are not faced with unexpected premium costs, do not lose coverage, and have access to the filing assistance they need, wrote Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Reps. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Bobby Scott (D-Va.).
Now the White House is taking active steps to starve the bureaucracy of its lifeblood: money and staff. He called for slashing the EPA's budget by 31 percent, the biggest cut of any federal agency, in addition to eliminating a fifth of its workforce. Efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes are among the more than 50 programs that would be eliminated. (Denise Lu and Tim Meko prepared several visualizations of the impacts such cuts would have on the environment.)
Rarely, but yes. The last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a Republican, Dick Cheney. That 50-50 split ended after six months when a Republican senator, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, switched parties, giving Democrats a 51-49 advantage. There also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the Congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the Senate Historical Office calls the Great Senate Deadlock of 1881.
The Post compiled Trump's comments on his religion as he addressed the National Prayer Breakfast:
But Democrats fear that setting up too many barriers and rules around the program will make it too hard for those who need it to enroll. They've been attacking the block grant rules, accusing Verma of giving states leeway to limit benefits and setting them up for future financial disaster by limiting the flow of federal dollars.
I don't know if the Department of Justice attorneys are working, Burakiewicz quipped during an interview with The Washington Post.
In the House, Pelosi and her lieutenants have tried to give a nod to progressives without letting them control the agenda. Though popular among the 2020 field, most of the proposals are unlikely to get a floor vote in the House since Democratic leaders think they would be likely to backfire on the party.
The House Budget Committee holds a hearing on the HHS budget on Tuesday.
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told senior officials to prepare for border surges now, Perry wrote. We need to begin making changes immediately. We should privilege action over cost considerations; do what is needed, and the department will work on funding afterward.
A Republican aide rejected the notion that conservative demands could sink the Senate's fledgling effort.
According to the Commonwealth survey, 28 percent of people with coverage through their workplaces were underinsured last year, meaning they faced out-of-pocket costs totaling at least 10 percent of their income (5 percent, if they were low-income). Twenty-four percent of these workers were underinsured in 2016.
Of course, three of the companies — AstraZeneca, Novovax and Sanofi — haven't yet had their vaccines approved in the United States. It's possible there could be some hiccups or delays for those companies in gaining emergency use approval by the Food and Drug Administration, strengthening the Biden administration's argument for buying so many vaccine doses.
Antony in Antony & Cleopatra: You do mistake your business.
It's called vaccine diplomacy, and several countries are heavily engaged in it. China has pledged half a billion doses of its vaccines to more than 45 countries, according to a tally by the Associated Press. Latin American countries are relying heavily on China, Russia and India for vaccines.
The New Hampshire Democratic debate will be held Friday.
One lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described being stunned at a recent White House meeting when Domestic Policy Council Director Joe Grogan said the administration would not let Democrats run to the president's left on lowering prescription medicine prices.
He also criticized Sessions for committing to following the advice of Justice Department ethics officials when it came to recusing himself from the Mueller probe, calling it an abdication of his own responsibility. That is despite having said this morning that Sessions likely made the right call to recuse.
Leaked preliminary funding proposals put many government agencies on the chopping block to fulfill Trump's lofty budget promises. (Jenny Starrs, Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)
Democrats abandoned negotiations on Wednesday in part because Republicans insisted that funding for the Zika measure be partially paid for by cuts to the Affordable Care Act and by shifting more than $100 million from the Ebola emergency fund, according to Democratic aides.

Low-income workers and the self-employed typically turn to Affordable Care Act marketplaces to buy health insurance. If workers earn between roughly $18,000 and $51,000, they are eligible for a government subsidy to make plans more affordable. But the catch comes if they signed up for health insurance in November or December 2019 — before the pandemic became a national emergency.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was one of the few Republicans commenting Monday on the court's decision to take the case, and said he looks forward to defending the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
Well, there's a number of factors at play here. The first is: When will this pandemic truly be over? Some health experts' estimates say the United States will see the worst of covid-19 (the most new infections and fatalities) by mid-April, and society could start opening up again by June or July.
They get that preexisting conditions must be protected, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said sarcastically in remarks aimed at his colleagues on the other end of the dais. They hear the message — it only took years; it only took hundreds of millions of dollars of campaign commercials.
[Richard] Grenell's public relations firm was paid to do work for a U.S. nonprofit funded almost entirely by the Hungarian government led by far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Emma Brown, Beth Reinhard and Dalton Bennett report. Individuals who have served as acting directors of national intelligence typically have been nonpartisan national security professionals whose experience has included leading intelligence agencies or service in the military. Now that promotion is drawing fresh scrutiny to Grenell's past, including his foreign affairs commentary and consulting work after he served as U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. His work for the Hungarian-funded nonprofit is the type of activity that, in other cases, has drawn the attention of Justice Department investigators tasked with enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
What the state is doing is kicking tens of thousands of people off health care, under the guise of an experiment that they aren't even collecting any data about, let alone analyzing it, Kevin De Liban, a Legal Aid lawyer in northeast Arkansas who is active in the federal lawsuit against the work rules, told Amy.
TRUMP: I will say one thing, what Marco said is -- I understand it. He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation. And you know what? That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world.
RUBIO: Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.
Lee and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) are part of the 12-person Senate working group on health care, which has intensified its efforts following House passage of the amended American Health Care Act by a razor-thin margin last week.
That is because CBO's most detailed estimates are limited to the next 10 years, and any projections beyond that point are usually vague and approximate. Under the new GOP bill, the change in the index would not take effect until 2025. That does not leave enough time for the change to a different measure of inflation to take full effect.
The administration's expected move comes as Republicans' legislative efforts to repeal the 2010 law, known as Obamacare, and replace it with a new system has stalled. Instead, Trump administration officials are increasingly turning to executive actions and regulations to weaken the ACA, including cutting off billions in federal reimbursements insurers receive for lower-income customers, shrinking the annual enrollment period and scaling back federal money to promote sign-ups under the law.
HOT ON THE LEFT: NYU social work school acknowledges 'institutional racism' after classroom episode, from Morgan Smith: Shahem Mclaurin says he didn't go to school to be a 'revolutionary leader.' But that's the role he has found himself in after his tweet about an incident at New York University's Silver School of Social Work spurred university officials to acknowledge 'ongoing institutional racism' in their classrooms and inspired other students to criticize the Silver School for failing to address racist behavior on campus. On Feb. 12, Mclaurin described the incident in a widely shared Twitter thread. [The 24-year-old graduate student] emailed his classmates … to ask if someone could connect him via FaceTime during class. No one responded. After class, one of the students emailed Shahem and explained why he didn't answer. 'I found it easier to lead the discussion without black presence in the room, since I do feel somewhat uncomfortable with the (perceived) threat that it poses — something which I have been working on, but it will take more time than I would like it to be,' the student wrote. HOT ON THE RIGHT: Where in the world does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez live? from the New York Post: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state's three other freshman members.
But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future.
The Bipartisan Policy Center holds an event on federal funding to combat the opioid crisis.
The debate over domestic terrorism has drawn renewed concerns about the potential impact on civil liberties after two decades of war on terrorism saw the government carry out warrantless wiretapping of Americans, targeting of reporters on national security grounds and the use of harsh interrogation practices that meet international definitions of torture.
Biden says he wants to be a president who doesn't see red and blue states, but a United States. And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.
While the Bornstein saga is certainly not shorn of entertainment … what he's now alleging is the stuff of scandal, Aaron writes. The combination of Bornstein's strangeness and the fact that the bar has been so lowered when it comes to Trump's medical disclosures shouldn't temper that fact. Just as the Stormy Daniels situation seemed trivial and even overly salacious before becoming arguably the White House's biggest legal liability, it would be a shame to relegate the Bornstein show to the side of the stage. It may ultimately come to nothing, but there are real questions here — both for the legal system and for democracy.
It's deplorable what he said, Isakson told Georgia Public Broadcasting in an interview Wednesday afternoon.
While the alliance with Trump raised the think tank's profile, it also repelled some ideological conservatives who did not view Trump as consistently compatible with conservative traditions.
Domestic developments that shouldn't be overlooked
I don't know if this is my ninth or 10th budget conference, and what I have learned is that the least said, the better, Jones said. But he was optimistic that the two chambers could reach a deal.
I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families — no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
Now what is being done is DHS is not referring for prosecution family units that will lead to the separation of children, he said.
Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...
While he expressed support for its goals, Summers warned that it might set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation and passing it could sap dollars and drain will from efforts to address other progressive priorities.
Meanwhile, for all the Federalist Society's steamrolling progress on display, I detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. Near the conclusion of the gala, while McGahn and McConnell are still gloating, I notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. It's George Conway III, husband of Trump communications counselor Kellyanne Conway. George is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to McGahn and McConnell.
You can feel it now. In Congress, it has started to shift. It has started to shift. We're not there yet. We're not all the way there, but it has started to shift, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said at a presidential campaign event Sunday night in Davenport, Iowa, when discussing her support for the Green New Deal. We've got new energy in this. We've got new blood in this. We've got new ideas in this. No one is saying there's a single silver bullet that's going to fix the whole problem. What's happening is people are coming up with lots of pieces.
The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health holds a hearing on the ACA and protections for preexisting conditions.
President Trump described immigration at the southern border as a tremendous onslaught and called on Congress to protect our homeland on Feb. 5. (The Washington Post)
The DNC has begun to roll out rules for its debates, which begin in June and may end up being the most crowded in the history of presidential politics. The gist:
Ryan's record is mixed on other issues, too. Before becoming speaker, he pushed for action on comprehensive immigration reform, even joining outspoken immigration advocate Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) at a joint forum to voice his support. But he became speaker partly by promising not to advance immigration legislation that didn't enjoy majority support in the GOP conference, and despite much discussion, especially after Trump threatened protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, nothing ever happened.
This law, passed by Indiana in 2016 and signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, also prohibits women from getting an abortion due to gender, race, color, national origin or ancestry. Furthermore, if the doctor performing the abortion knew these were motivating factors for the women, they would risk losing their medical license and could be subject to civil penalties.
— Jan. 24, remarks on signing executive memorandum
Schumer's remarks are also somewhat similar to an August amicus brief from Democratic senators, led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). In the brief, Whitehouse and the senators seemed to threaten some kind of public reckoning if the court didn't drop a gun case.
Known as Ben, Augustus Benton Chafin Jr. grew up working on his family's Russell County farm.
She has held her life close to her vest, revealing only snippets over the years. In 2008, she assured potential voters that her parents never abandoned her. When my dad ran for office in '91 and '92, in the 13 months that he was running, there were only three nights when one or both of my parents weren't with me, and there were maybe a handful of Sundays that we didn't spend together, she said. People often ask me, 'Do you have the privilege to believe that quality is more important than quantity in family time?' No, I don't have to — because my parents were always around.
Noisy crosstalk ensued before Sanders — who, like Biden, is in his 70s — stepped in to say he is part of Biden's generation, and that the issues in this presidential contest are not generational.
1. The cuts proposed by the administration aren't aimed at seniors' medical benefits. Instead, they're reductions in future Medicare spending and they'd be carried out mostly by reducing payments to health providers and rooting out inefficiencies and wasteful spending.
Washington state's health secretary John Wiesman is calling for a national campaign, similar to the government's efforts to stop smoking, to combat the false information coming from parents and others regarding immunizations to prevent a variety of childhood diseases. At least 75 people have been sickened by the measles outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, and most of those are unvaccinated children under age 10. The region is home to some of the most vocal and organized anti-vaccination activists, Lena writes.
When I asked about his relationship with Beijing last night, Bloomberg said that every U.S. businessperson and every big company has no choice but to deal with them.
RUBIO: Well, then answer the economy question.
Finally, last Thursday, the Trump administration unveiled its latest scheme to slash spending on Medicaid, the program that provides health coverage to a fifth of Americans nationwide. It's an idea the GOP has been pushing for decades, called block grants.
-- Democrats are preparing for a hostile Trump transition. From Politico: At least one outside group that works with the 2020 Democratic campaigns has quietly launched a transition-related effort designed to offer an early look at the landscape that awaits them if they oust Trump. … That Democrats are making transition-related moves more than nine months before Election Day underscores not only their distrust of Trump but also the reality that taking over the U.S. government is a mammoth task with high stakes. … Every transition is tricky given the thousands of positions that need to be filled and the array of policy priorities a new team wants to pursue. But several Democrats attached to different 2020 campaigns mentioned very specific concerns about what a Trump departure could mean … The Democrats said they worry that Trump's political appointees won't meet with the incoming team, that there will be little, if any, paperwork left behind to guide them, and that what documents are shared will not be trustworthy.
Fortunately in Libya, there's only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert. The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be -- and not just with special forces. I mean, that's not going to work. Come on. You've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that. And we have to be in the air.
It is tragic that Trump has tried so hard to demolish the Affordable Care Act, apparently because it is popularly known as Obamacare. It is heartbreaking that he has tried so hard to roll back the Obama administration's environmental regulations, though that may have more to do with Trump's bizarre denial of climate change. And I almost laughed out loud Wednesday when Trump, after so often scoffing at Obama's faith in multilateralism, called on NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.
CMS on gave Utah permission on Friday to require low-income individuals on Medicaid to work, saying in an approval letter that we believe an objective of the Medicaid program, in addition to paying for services, is to advance the health and wellness needs of its beneficiaries, and that it is appropriate for the state to structure its demonstration project in a manner that prioritizes meeting those needs, as Kaiser Health News's Phil Galewitz reports.
Attacks against Trump, which were relatively scattered in Wednesday's session of the debate, erupted with greater frequency and intensity in the early stages of Thursday's session. But the Democratic Party's slide left was evident both nights, with several candidates taking issue with the Obama administration, which was far more centrist than the party's stakeholders today.
Barrasso and Cassidy are both physicians, while Scott is a former hospital executive – perhaps indicators of Trump's decision to name them directly.
Top on the agenda will be unraveling changes the Trump administration made to the Obamacare marketplaces and the Medicaid program.
It was a frenzied decathlon of a day in American politics, and so Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) pulled his cellphone out of his pocket as he power-walked the halls of the U.S. Capitol. Coons's wife had installed a step counter over Christmas. The step counter would now be put to the test.
-- The Trump administration's agenda has suffered an unusually high number of defeats at the hands of federal judges, largely due to officials' amateurish handling of cases. Fred Barbash and Deanna Paul report: Federal judges have ruled against the Trump administration at least 63 times over the past two years … In case after case, judges have rebuked Trump officials for failing to follow the most basic rules of governance for shifting policy, including providing legitimate explanations supported by facts and, where required, public input. … [T]he rulings so far paint a remarkable portrait of a government rushing to implement sweeping changes in policy without regard for long-standing rules against arbitrary and capricious behavior. …
On Tuesday, Azar held an agencywide staff meeting that was webcast. There's talk that he is trying to connect with top health-care lawmakers on Capitol Hill; staff for Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), who serves as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, confirmed Azar has been in touch to set up a meeting with the senator.
TRUMP: And they're killing -- they're going to...
It would be the single largest transfer of delegates from the latter system — which usually helps grass-roots candidates — to the former. And it would move the primary to March 10, one week after the first Super Tuesday.
— An initiative in New York City meant to address mental illness has had some challenges in the first few years. Even as Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife Chirlane McCray traverse the country, often touting the nearly $1 billion plan, the program has failed to spend a third of its budget and has seen two recent leadership changes, as the New York Times's J. David Goodman reports.
-- In her new book Kushner, Inc. journalist Vicky Ward claims that Jared Kushner's peace plan included land swaps with Saudi Arabia and an oil pipeline from that kingdom into Gaza. New York Magazine's Matt Stieb writes: According to Ward, who spoke with 'multiple people who saw drafts of the plan,' Kushner proposed a geopolitical version of the multi-destination NBA player swap, in which Jordan would give territory to the Palestinian authority, and 'in return, Jordan would get land from Saudi Arabia, and that country would get back two Red Sea islands it gave Egypt to administer in 1950.' In her book, Ward writes that Jared planned on having the Saudis and Emiratis to provide economic assistance to the Palestinians. There were plans for an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia to Gaza, where refineries and a shipping terminal could be built. The profits would create desalination plants, where Palestinians could find work, addressing the high unemployment rate.
I looked out, the field was — it looked like a million, million and a half people. … The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.
Trump's numbers for private insurance are a little off. The Census Bureau says that in 2017, 217 million Americans had private insurance, with 181 million covered through an employer and 52 million directly purchasing it. Meanwhile, 123 million Americans are covered already through a government plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military health system.
The difficult relationship between business and government is the worst I have ever seen it, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the longtime chief executive of General Electric, wrote this spring in his annual letter to shareholders. Asked in July if corporate leaders could help end the political dysfunction, Immelt told an interviewer from LinkedIn that the idea of getting 100 CEOs to come to Washington to push some policy is now just a laugh line.

The procedure is estimated to cost anywhere from $5,000 to $8,000, according to court documents, Thomas writes, adding the Shouldice Hernia Hospital is marketed as the global leader non-mesh hernia repair. The hospital's website outlines payments it accepts, including cash, check or credit card for those patients, like Paul, who are not covered by Ontario's insurance plan or a provincial health insurance plan.
The calls never came, even in a part of Virginia that supported Donald Trump overwhelmingly in 2016 and seemed immune to the blue wave that swept over much of Virginia last year.
The notion of African Americans as captives is meant to convey that black Republicans are free, while black Democrats, who make up about 90 percent of black voters, are victims of groupthink — which is why the idea appeals so much to West. A defining feature of his career is the degree to which he cherishes, and nurtures, his self-conception as an outside-the-box thinker. His line from the infamous How, Sway? interview pretty much captures it: I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google. He knows he is, rightly, considered a musical genius. The rest of what he does — from promoting his Derelicte-esque couture to his rush to embrace Trump — suggests that recognition as a performer and producer was never enough. He seems to want people to see him as special, even ordained. Several days before he tweeted about Owens, West tweeted:
Trump himself has been denying that the new measure constitutes a Muslim ban. But the new lawsuit will likely rely, among other things, on Trump's own words to show that the measure is intended to achieve a similar discriminatory effect, albeit in a manner designed to pass legal muster. For instance: In the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, Trump explicitly called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. And then, in a major terrorism speech in June 2016, Trump talked about this original Muslim ban and the idea of a ban on immigration from select countries as, in effect, the same proposal:
This is bigger than health care, Trump said in a November address announcing the regulation. The word is transparency. I love transparency in many ways. It is going to be incredible for consumers, patients, good doctors.
The bet that they're making is still the same one — that this is going to be a base election, not an election on persuasion, and so he's hitting his key issues, said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican House leadership and the Republican National Committee. The challenge they face is it was, and will be, a very fine needle to thread. There's not much margin for error.
The Republican replacement bill initially contained this provision. But it was removed in the version that ultimately passed the House, in order to help its chances of moving through the Senate using a parliamentary procedure that would require no Democratic votes.
Meanwhile, in a move that aims to expand care for transgender individuals in the region, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington told The Post recently that it plans to offer hormone replacement therapy in each of its three regional health centers, in Northeast Washington, Suitland, Md., and Gaithersburg, Md.
Yesterday, a group of more than 70 psychologists, psychiatrists and mental health professionals sent a letter to Trump's physician imploring him to include an evaluation of the president's neurological health in the checkup today. Per Dem donor Tom Steyer:
Ryan has consistently backed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe but has been frequently criticized for saying too little when it came to Trump's unorthodox statements and actions related to Russia. He defended Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey, and in more recent months he has repeatedly said he does not believe Trump will move to fire Mueller. He has given no indication that he is at all interested in taking legislative steps to protect the special counsel from being removed.
TRUMP: And that's a huge -- of course it is. We are going to buy things for less money. Of course it is. That works out...
Trump went beyond the promises of any of his predecessors since AIDS appeared as a deadly scourge nearly four decades ago, my colleague Amy Goldstein reports. He announced a strategy to stop the spread of HIV by 2030 by concentrating as-yet unspecified resources on 48 counties and other 'hot spots' where half the nation's new infections occur.
AHH: This year, there will be more female CEOs than men named Michael giving corporate presentations at the year's biggest biotech conference, Stat News reports. Last year, the website had noted there were more Michaels presenting than women at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.
Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.
Later on Wednesday, Michigan State's long-serving president resigned, our colleague Susan Svrluga reports. To the survivors, I can never say enough that I am so sorry that a trusted, renowned physician was really such an evil, evil person who inflicted such harm under the guise of medical treatment, Lou Anna Simon said in a statement. U.S. Olympic Committee chief executive Scott Blackmun also issued an apology, calling the abuse by Nassar worse than our worst fears.
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement Monday that it was encouraged that the Senate proposal includes several urgently needed and important steps to help make the individual market for insurance more stable and affordable for the next two years, including the new penalty for a break in coverage.
Barr offered an unconventional rationale for how he could steer clear of politics if confirmed as attorney general — that he was too old to care about becoming unpopular.
The problem is Maryland cannot protect itself from price gouging, and it leaves vulnerable people throughout our state subject to monstrous price increases by generic drug manufacturers, Frosh said about the Supreme Court's decision not to take up his appeal.
That means the savings will be for mostly young, healthy people. Republicans' health-care bill would make insurance more expensive for older, sicker people, according to the CBO, particularly for older, poorer, sicker people:
The sheer range of goals listed in that paragraph are emblematic of the varied response Azar has prompted in the projects he's prioritized as secretary. On one hand, Azar and top officials have won some applause from Democrats for moves to address some widely shared concerns, like cracking down on e-cigarettes and boosting the number of generic drug approvals.
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
Cox, who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, opposed Medicaid expansion for years but changed course after an anti-Trump wave in state elections last year nearly erased the GOP's 66-to-34 majority in the House.
We talked about ways to have a smoother glide path, rather than an abrupt cutoff, said Barrasso. There have been worries among GOP senators from Medicaid expansion states that the House bill's rollbacks to Medicaid would be too abrupt and severe. This Senate proposal would extend the timeline beyond 2020.
Just one example, from conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza:
TRUMP: And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.
That was then. Graham was pointed in rebuilding his relationship with Trump and eventually became one of the president's closest allies. When Graham sought reelection last year, Trump gave him his support. Graham won.
It's known as the Byrd Rule, and any senator can raise a point of order under it to challenge a policy's pertinence to the budget. Parliamentarians, the behind-the-scenes nonpartisan rule-keepers of Congress, decide what policies actually affect the budget under the Byrd Rule.
The White House on Friday launched a forceful push on health care at the National Governors Association meeting, but Trump himself was not involved and it was not clear how many minds the effort might change.
Kustoff and 216 other House Republicans voted to pass the American Health Care Act to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on May 4.
Former congressman John Delaney (D-Md.) mentioned health care in 20 percent of his policy posts, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in 12 percent of her policy posts and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 4 percent of her policy-related social media posts, to name a few. Our colleagues also tracked other issues related to health care, including gun control, social justice issues and criminal justice. Check out some of those results below:
While some nuance is common when interpreting intelligence, the mixed messaging among Trump's top advisers … is potentially problematic for senior officials as they begin to brief lawmakers who remain divided over the operation. ... According to Esper, only the Gang of Eight will receive the 'exquisite intelligence that . . . was one of the factors that led to the decision to strike at Soleimani.' Gang of Eight lawmakers who attended the Tuesday briefing with intelligence leaders refused to comment on what they heard. But in the intelligence community, the term 'exquisite' is often applied to satellites or other highly classified reconnaissance systems that provide detailed information, including the words an individual spoke or the person's precise movements. Esper's choice of words suggested the U.S. could have intercepted communications or other intelligence that he believes revealed Soleimani's intentions.
Trump's wiretap allegations completed a feedback loop that started during the presidential campaign and has gotten sturdier since. The president's media diet includes cable television news shows, like Fox and Friends, where guests and hosts regularly defend him. On Twitter, he frequently elevates stories that grew in conservative talk radio, or on sites like Breitbart News and InfoWars, out of view of a startled mainstream media. Monday's news cycle demonstrated just how strong the loop was, as Levin himself appeared on Fox News for 12 barely interrupted minutes to share his theory that the alleged wiretapping was a political hit job.
Perriello, 42, grew up outside Charlottesville and got his undergraduate and law degrees from Yale. He won election to Congress in 2008, representing the conservative 5th District. During his single term, he won stature within the party for supporting the Affordable Care Act despite his conservative constituency.
Feinstein said she was pleased Barr had said in written testimony it was important for Mueller to be allowed to finish his work, but the sentiments he expressed in the memo gave her pause.
Trump had been dissuaded by his staff from staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington the night before and regretted his decision to sleep at Blair House, the official guest residence across the street from the White House, according to Wolff's account.
They can do math really well, Azar told me yesterday.
In some cases, Trump is continuing to do what he had been doing, pushing policies that have won him plaudits among his conservative supporters. In others, he is using the broad powers granted to the executive branch amid a national crisis to pursue policy goals he has long sought and in some cases struggled to achieve.
Republican leaders reacted with alarm, fearing that health care would be a political loser for them, especially with a Democratic-run House able to block any GOP proposal. After a week, Trump relented, punting any real action on health care until 2021.
Jackson retired as a Navy rear admiral in 2019 and was elected to represent a Texas congressional district in November. He has denied misconduct and described the report as a partisan attack motivated by his support for Trump.
Experts disagree on whether the VA's rollout has been slower than is reasonable. Some have raised safety and efficacy concerns about the treatment, and the effort to get it covered and administered in the private health care system has been rocky, Megan writes. But there is little doubt that the VA's moves to make Spravato accessible stand in sharp contrast with Trump's claims that the drug could deliver widespread relief for veterans struggling with depression.
And that's not all. The Trump administration also opened the door for states to request their Medicaid funding come in the form of a fixed block grant. In return, Verma promised them unprecedented flexibility over how to structure their programs. The new administration is exploring ways to pull back on that allowance as well.
I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.
One thing I trust the Senate will deal with is making sure that states that didn't expand Medicaid shouldn't be at a disadvantage versus other states, Handel added. So fix that. Make sure that the language on preexisting conditions is exactly right. As I read it, there are richer protections for people with preexisting conditions in the House bill than there were previously. From a practical standpoint, there are things they can do to give it a good solid foundation to keep moving forward.
LOSERS: Steyer, anyone who asked Steyer a question and Buttigieg on race
Sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct or assault. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over. (He never did so.)
The measure – which Rubio first introduced last August and has since slightly modified – avoids creating a new government benefit by drawing on existing retirement funds, stopping far short of a more generous but expensive parental leave bill Democrats are backing.
The price for this success, however, was a dramatic increase in partisanship and polarization. The anti-tax, anti-regulation, ­anti-government rhetoric emanating from the Republican majority grew so extreme, and the politicians spouting it so hard line, that soon there was no room for compromise.
You look at George W. Bush, who worked with Ted Kennedy early on with education. Trump is going to have to find somebody he can work with on the other side, Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said. He knows he has to appeal to people because he's not ideological, but he has to find out how he can get out of the Republican straitjacket and build the relationships, figure out a coalition for taxes, for infrastructure.
* AND McCONNELL GOES QUIET ON TRUMP'S 'RIGGED' LIES: The Associated Press tried to get Mitch McConnell to comment on Trump's claims that the election is rigged. No luck:
Republicans reacted to Udall's news by pointing out that Hillary Clinton had not cleared 50 percent of the vote in New Mexico's 2016 election. But the local popularity of Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson scrambled the vote; Donald Trump underperformed every Republican presidential nominee in New Mexico since 1992. And in 2018, Democrats swept the state, building a supermajority in the state legislature and electing Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham by 14 points.
In November, 6 in 10 Idaho voters said they wanted their state to expand Medicaid coverage, while in Utah a narrow majority approved such a plan. Despite the success of these ballot initiatives, the future of Medicaid expansion in these states is still being called into question. Andy Slavitt, who headed CMS under President Obama, called these sabotage efforts the ultimate form of politics over what voters want.
Convene a Racial Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission
-- Trump seems to believe the United States has already lost a trade war with China, according to his morning tweet:
The other provisions resulted in CBO estimates that fewer hours would be worked in the economy. But that's not the same thing as lost jobs. Regular readers may recall that in 2014 we wrote an article based on the same CBO report that the House GOP cites as evidence. The headline was: No, CBO did not say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs.
Vague statements? You betcha. Discussions are just starting, pieces are moving all over the place and everything could change quickly over the next few weeks. But for now, here are the biggest health policy questions lawmakers may or may not tackle in the upcoming spending fight.
Under this block grant approach, states can agree to receive a lump-sum payment to finance care for adults who became eligible for Medicaid when the 2010 health-care law expanded it. In return, they can make a range of changes to the program, some of which weren't allowed previously. These changes could include:
The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations holds a hearing on rising insulin costs.
Republicans are counting on Price to clarify Trump's bottom line position, freeing them to pursue Obamacare replacement legislation that doesn't risk rejection by the White House. … The possibility the White House won't go along with them has been a major source of anxiety for Republicans.
Across the street from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore is a home for seniors where Oliver Spriggs, a 78-year-old retired veteran, lives. On Wednesday he was walking his 8-year-old grandson Keishawn there when I asked him how he thought Trump was doing.
On the stump, he is at his most compelling when he stops talking about himself and starts telling the stories of the people he has met. Some of them have crossed Biden's path here in New Hampshire: the security guard mourning the death of her father and fearful of the test that grief is putting on her 30 years of sobriety; the man who confided he has just lost his job and is afraid to tell his family; the woman who fled the man who beat her and ended up living on the street; the line of people standing in 22-degree temperatures at a downtown food bank, some of them children wearing no gloves. This is the better Biden, embracing personal vulnerability over electoral invincibility. He is perhaps the most authentic tribune of empathy in public life today — and the starkest contrast imaginable from the man who sits in the Oval Office.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Jan. 9 attacked President Trump for the collateral damage on government workers from the government shutdown. (Reuters)
We've proved over eight years that's hard to do on Obamacare so I'd rather work on this other set of issues for the next couple of years, Alexander continued, pointing to broader efforts underway to rein in drug prices and increase transparency.
5:15 p.m.: Barr says it's 'understandable' a person who felt falsely accused would term investigation a 'witch hunt'
And there were others, too. Via Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.):
The American people should hear how House Democrats expect to address the massive costs associated with Medicare-for-All, the pair wrote to Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). We have a responsibility to review any legislative proposal that is supported by so many members of the House majority, especially one that threatens to impact directly the lives of millions of Americans by upending how they receive their coverage.
Gooden's mishap didn't affect the fate of the bill, which passed 220 to 112, with two Democrats voting against it. But it was the latest addition to a storied history of distracted or confused lawmakers casting the wrong vote — sometimes with far more consequential results.
But you know what, I'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. Why don't we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country? I think that's what people want.
CVS Pharmacy President Kevin Hourican told Angelica that not all CVS locations will become HealthHubs but the concept could expand to more stores if the pilots are successful.
We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
-- The Energy Department released a trove of documents related to former secretary Rick Perry's Ukraine dealings. The documents show the department applauding Ukraine for its handling of corruption last May. But the new records don't cover how Trump allegedly began pushing Perry in a different direction: to work with Giuliani to pursue a deal with Ukraine that would help the president politically. (CNN)
The mental health counselor, a native of Sweden who became a U.S. citizen in 2004, calls herself ultra-conservative and strongly supports the president. Trump wants to put something together that's actually going to last and work for everybody, Caswell explained. To do that, you have to start over. That's what they're doing.
Let's be clear: Sanders is not only far less electable against Trump than is Joe Biden, but he's also less electable than Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former mayors Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg, and just about anyone else who qualifies for a debate stage or is registering in national polls. Of course, loyal Democrats, including us, would absolutely vote for Sanders against Trump. But the Sanders agenda won't stand up to scrutiny for a lot of people who are open to ousting him. That's the definition of unelectable.
The American Enterprise Institute holds a discussion on If one part of the Affordable Care Act is ruled unconstitutional, what is the proper remedy or resolution? on Friday.
On the business side the proposals include:
While orphan drug designations have been hugely helpful for patients whose illnesses might be otherwise ignored, drug makers have also manipulated the system to maximize profits.
Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.
Sure enough, a CBS News poll released Thursday found 74 percent of Americans haven't heard of him, including 85 percent of Republicans.
Fiscal issues have long been Ryan's focus, as chairman of the Budget Committee and then the Ways and Means Committee, and it's there that his failure to deliver looks most glaring, given years of promises and budget proposals aimed at slashing spending and reining in entitlements.
Financial support from the federal legislation, as well as state efforts, may not be enough to reopen classrooms in districts where families have been reluctant to send their kids back to school or where administrators and employee unions have not been able to come to terms on safety measures.
Mr. Hanna voted with the GOP majority in 2011 to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama the previous year, and he said the universal health care mandate was a mess and unmanageable. But he openly criticized party leadership for its role in shutting down the federal government in 2013 amid debate over the ACA.
I do not think we should fully eliminate the filibuster,  Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) told Power Up. It's one of the few things that we have left in the Senate that allows all voices be heard. But I am open to looking at and discussing reform proposals, like the talking filibuster, so we can get back to talking to each other and effectively governing on behalf of the American people.
For the past several years, OAN has been a corporate sponsor of CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, one of the nation's premier gatherings of right-wing politicians and supporters. One America News has your back, OAN anchor Patrick Hussion told CPAC in a 2015 speech. Charles Herring said OAN sponsored CPAC to get our name known in the Washington, D.C. area to get better guests. I don't think we'll be doing that in the future.
Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard who spent a year in Iraq in 2005, used her military service to criticize what she called President Trump's bellicose rhetoric toward Iran.
Obamacare isn't technically an entitlement program, even as it has some features of entitlements in it; it's something people have to pay for under the individual mandate — not something the government gives them for free. But there are subsidies involved, and those subsidies would suddenly be off the table, pending a GOP replacement.
Why the change of heart? Gooden quickly jumped on Twitter to explain.
To Romney, Ryan was exactly the kind of person he would have hired in the private sector, former aides said. He was young, ambitious and wonky — and unafraid to take politically risky positions.
The 46-year-old physician, who has been commuting weekly to Washington from his home in Connecticut, said he plans to spend a half-dozen days a month in Washington as a resident fellow at the conservative think tank, she writes. Besides that, he said, he has no commitments for now other than taking his family to Disney World.
Americans want to be generous to those in need. Many of the covid-19 relief bill provisions do that. But people do not want to bail out the rich or throw money at those who have already been helped. Approving the bill as it is currently written will clearly do the latter, not the former.
Fortunately, there is a prototype. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, 17 objectives constituting a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. Now, the United States needs its own version — focused not on promoting sustainable development but on fostering a sustainable society. We can call them the Domestic Sustainable Society Goals.
Everyone I spoke with offered the same reply: Yes, they would still support Clinton over Trump.
In what universe should Biden be making concessions to someone who has done so poorly in the race and who, the Democratic voters decided, holds views that make him unelectable? When a candidate wins based on voters' perception, he is the most electable. He should not have to concede to the loser.
The bill would broaden the list of charges prosecutors could use against suspects to bring them more in line with the tools they have to go after international terrorists. The 2019 bill would have modified the U.S. Code section on terrorism to include options for the death penalty, prison sentences and fines for attacks carried out by U.S. actors on U.S. soil.
Trump's tweet came a day after a strange episode that prompted speculation that he was seeking to undermine Ryan's standing.
Renna also cited a GDP growth forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which is predicting 3.9 percent GDP growth for the second quarter of 2018. The Atlanta Fed cautions that this is an unofficial forecast (updated every few days). In any case, that covers only one quarter, but there are 39 other quarters to consider during the 10-year time frame for analyzing the cost of Trump's tax cuts.
• Restore protections blocking deportation of 660,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, a group known as Dreamers.
He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party. It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month. So, I don't take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant. He wants to be back in the game.
CEA created an index of health insurers participating and not participating in ACA exchange and Medicaid plans; our financial software reports healthcare or insurance indices and there is no way to separate the two in the data we have access to, the White House official said, conceding that the report covers a a time period when some publicly traded insurers still offered plans on the exchange.
The longer people are confined to their homes, and the longer that stores, restaurants and other businesses remain closed, the more Americans will be accessing federal assistance — not just those with the lowest incomes. That could change public opinion about the value of the safety net — or even what it should be composed of — as well as the role of government, Waxman said.
Don't feel too sorry for the unempowered chief executive. Their companies still spend more than $3 billion a year on Washington lobbyists and offices. And on issues of narrow interest to individual companies or industries — regulations, tax provisions, line-item appropriations — corporate lobbying efforts are as effective as ever.
Hahn, who was confirmed in mid-December, disagreed, saying in an interview that the sales restrictions will target the products most popular with young people. But the FDA will closely monitor the situation, and if minors do switch to menthol-flavored vapes or other e-cigarette products, the agency will take further action to curb vaping, he said, Laurie writes.
Anthem joins two other major insurers that have left the Virginia marketplace for 2018: UnitedHealthcare and Aetna.
Gottlieb was previously a resident fellow at AEI before he joined the Trump administration. During his tenure as FDA commissioner, he has shown an interest in tackling skyrocketing drug prices, an issue that's not traditionally part of the agency's portfolio. He has pushed for quicker approvals of cheaper generic drugs as a way to increase competition and reduce costs for consumers, and has also pressed for developing innovative treatments that could have long-term benefits for patients.
My question is, what are you going to replace it with? Valde asked.
But the polling does not capture the full story. In dozens of interviews on the ground over three days, most Republicans and many independents who have concerns about the House bill stressed that they still detest Obamacare. Their expectations might seem unreasonable to anyone who is closely following the debate or is steeped in the complexities of public policy, but they believe Donald Trump can and should enact a replacement plan that will both reduce their costs and improve their quality of care.

There was lots of buzz overnight about the results in Wisconsin:
1:45 p.m.: Barr suggests Mueller's long-awaited report might not be made public
The Lawfare piece cited Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski as a possible model. He transmitted a referral of impeachment material related to Richard Nixon to the House Judiciary Committee in 1974: Jaworski later characterized the document as a 'road map': 55 pages of bare-bones factual information intended to point committee members to the relevant evidence so they could draw their own conclusions, they note. [It] has never become public, as it contained grand jury information.
It's very significant, Merkley told Merkley told NBC News's Sahil Kapur of Manchin's recent shift . There's been a tremendous sea change in the Democratic caucus, saying, 'We were elected to solve problems, not to apologize because McConnell stopped us.' That excuse will not fly, nor should it.
Those conclusions would be completely divorced from reality, but unfortunately, the polling suggests that they might find a willing audience among GOP voters. A recent Bloomberg poll found that 51 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaners say Trump better represents their view of what the GOP should stand for, while only 33 percent picked Ryan — meaning they might be open to the argument that Ryan, not Trump, was the problem that led to the latter's inglorious defeat. Meanwhile, another poll shows that two thirds of Republicans think voter fraud is a bigger problem than voter disenfranchisement is — meaning they'll be open to Trump's argument that the election was stolen from them, and will likely demand that GOP leaders continue to push to restrict voting, further alienating nonwhites (something those leaders might be inclined to do in any case).
The ceremony was much in keeping with tradition. It featured prayers from an array of religious leaders and music by the U.S. Marine Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Kelly believes a candidate who excites people – who makes them want to get off the couch – is essential to victory, and she said a simplistic focus on electability puts a premium on milquetoast when that's not what historically wins. For whatever reason, Biden's just not exciting to me, she explained. Also, to be honest, I think Warren is in the rearview mirror. But, she added, her daughter is planning to drive home on Tuesday afternoon from Brown University in Rhode Island, where she's a student, so that she can vote – probably for Warren.
Earlier in the day, the president and aides met with top antiabortion leader Marjorie Dannenfelser and several other activists who call themselves abortion survivors. On a call with reporters, Dannenfelser described Trump as the most pro-life-acting president who has ever been.
In the same news conference, Reid offered some violent imagery to describe Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as she negotiated a spending package with Republicans: You could put a gun to her head right now and she can't tell you what they're trying to come up with.
The NYT also has a good piece on Keith Hall, the director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, who has been the target of GOP attacks on his estimates for how much the House health-care legislation will cost and how many people are estimated to lose insurance under it. From Alan Rappeport: Staying out of the political fray while working in its epicenter can be daunting, and Mr. Hall inevitably gets thrust into a spotlight that he does not crave. 'We're a nonpartisan place and we're working in a partisan world and we get treated as if we're partisan,' Mr. Hall, 60, said in an interview ... 'That's unfortunate.'
10:05 a.m.: In opening statement, Barr vows to let Mueller probe finish
With assurances of support from Trump, Republicans have been pushing the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act as a way of drawing attention to late-term abortions, after confusing and controversial remarks by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D). The bill, sponsored by Sasse says an infant born alive at any stage of development is a person under federal law and clarifies the care they must receive.
He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.
As an American living abroad, I am frustrated seeing America lag so far behind so much of the world on basic issues. Biden should move American policy to catch up. Trump looked particularly insane from the outside looking in, but plenty of what looks backward about America from a global perspective predated Trump and needs work.
Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, briefed GOP senators Wednesday afternoon in a bid to build bicameral consensus on the developing House framework.
Judy Woodruff, PBS: But it wasn't a religion that killed them.
Reduce or end the government's role in student loans. (The federal government remains very much involved in student loans, which Trump used to delay loan payments during the coronavirus pandemic.)
-- Joe Biden's team pitched Amy Klobuchar's advisers on a possible alliance during next Monday night's Iowa caucuses, but the Klobuchar team dismissed the offer as not serious. The New York Times reports the plan would involve a pledge to help each other in precincts where one of them doesn't meet the threshold of 15 percent support required to win delegates. People in both campaigns played down the conversation after word leaked.
This site is an American Terrorist site degrading our intelligence with misinformation, wrote a critic named Don Whitehall. No shadow government in America
It's certainly a strange world in which a president who once described himself as very pro-choice is now a source of deep frustration for abortion rights advocates.
In fact, this is exactly what Congress created the CBO to do....
BIDEN: I mean, he's been talking about health care, Medicare-for-all, universal health care, for 35 years. Nothing's happened. I helped get passed Obamacare. I helped move it forward. I got the votes. I'm in a position where I take something that I promise you, I'll get done. We take Obamacare. We allow people — like out here in Nevada, what's going on? Bernie requires, and Elizabeth's plan requires you to give up all private insurance. These folks have broken their necks, the culinary union and others, to get the most comprehensive health care that's out there. And they've given up wages for it. Now they're being told you've got to give it up, you can't, you can't keep it, and it's going to cost $30 trillion or more, and I can't tell you who's going to pay for it. I mean come on. This is — I mean, I think people are so tired of the lack of straightforwardness out there. Now, if I'm wrong, I'm going to be dead wrong, but I really believe that you have to lay out why you're doing what you're doing and how you're going to get it done.
Murray's bill was timed to the release of a new report from public health organization Trust for America's Health, which claimed that underinvestment in public health led to failures in the country's pandemic response. The bill has the backing of more than 120 health organizations, including the Association of American Medical Colleges, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum, and March of Dimes.
In the modern era, there are few if any examples of a country with a healthy, thriving economy and a broken political system. What distinguishes a successful economy from a failing one — what distinguishes Denmark from Italy and South Korea from North — is not how much capital it has or technology it produces but the quality of its institutions — the laws, rules, norms and policies that create the framework in which any economy operates. And there should be no doubt that as a result of broken politics, the quality of the United States' institutions is already on the decline.
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian election interference is over. Here's what we know:
— Jan. 25, interview with ABC News
Call the executives at the parent company of Carrier, an air-conditioning manufacturer that is closing a plant in Indiana and moving to Mexico, and threaten to impose a 35 percent tariff on air conditioners imported into the United States. Trump predicts the company will say: Sir, we've decided to stay in the United States. (A deal was struck before Trump took office, preserving 800 jobs in Indiana and leading Trump to hail the announcement as a sign of things to come, although since then, many businesses have moved production out of Indiana and overseas.)
Ryan acknowledged on the call that he leads a deeply divided conference that is threatening to descend into open infighting. By pulling the bill Friday, Ryan said, he moved to let a little pressure off the system, let some nerves cool a little bit and then get back talking with each other while we work on this issue and all the other issues.
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.
It's sort of a smorgasbord right now, said Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.).
KELLY: ... With respect -- wait. With respect...
While the pair oppose the law's individual mandate, they argue the rest of of the health care law should be able to remain. They warn that striking down the entire law would be detrimental to millions.
Congress could likely subpoena the report in its entirety pursuant to recognized exceptions to grand jury secrecy, including a Nixon-era precedent in which courts upheld a grand jury's decision to transmit evidence and a sealed report to the House Judiciary Committee. Indeed, Congress could procure not only Mueller's report, but all investigative files that relate to the president. It could then make the material public if it so chose, as it did with the Starr report. The catch? Only congressional committee chairmen can issue subpoenas. With both the House and Senate under GOP control, Republicans could simply decline to do so. The 2018 midterm elections, therefore … may be crucial to determining whether and when Mueller's Trump-related work sees the light of day.
We're not going to fix this overnight, Azar told attendees. I have to remind the president of that occasionally.
Over the weekend, in an interview on Fox News about the UCLA dust-up, Owens said, The truth is, the numbers are in, okay. Police brutality is not an issue that is facing the black community whatsoever. But as The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery explained in 2016, The Post's reporting has found African Americans are killed by police at far higher rates than, for instance, whites. In terms of the impetus for ongoing protest, Columbia University professor John McWhorter, regularly tabbed as outside the black mainstream and a sometimes critic of the Black Lives Matter movement's approach, has argued that police violence is not just one of many issues in black America's take on racism: It is the central one.
Trump allies are betting the strategy will work again by bolstering enthusiasm among his most avid supporters, particularly older white voters in the upper Midwest who clinched his victory the last time, Ashley and Toluse write. But the approach also risks alienating moderate suburban voters, including those who took a chance on Trump's candidacy in hopes that his dealmaker persona would overcome Washington gridlock.
Republican leaders are coming to the bleak conclusion they will end summer and begin the fall with ZERO significant legislative accomplishments … they see the next four months as MORE troublesome than the first four. They're facing terrible budget choices and headlines, the painful effort to re-work the healthcare Rubik's Cube in the House (presuming it makes it out of the Senate), a series of special-election scares (or losses) — all with scandal-mania as the backdrop.
Actually, Obama's ratings in 2009 were 7 million people higher than Trump's numbers. Second-term inaugurals tend to get lower ratings, so Trump is cherry-picking the comparison.
We're not going to sign on to something, vote for something to say we did it. But we're not in the 'we're just gonna let it collapse' camp, a conservative GOP aide said.
Republican reaction was almost nonexistent, even though President Trump has made abolishing the law a priority. While he has said he will preserve some of the program's most popular provisions — such as guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions — he has not put forward a plan.
But liberals have come to see Rosenstein as a defender of the special investigation, and his ouster could be viewed as causing a threat to its continuing. Rosenstein, after all, appointed Mueller to lead the probe, and he has supervised it essentially since its inception. He was in charge, rather than Attorney General Jeff Sessions, because Sessions had recused himself from the case.
-- Eight Democratic senators said in a letter that the summit must demonstrate tangible, verifiable progress on denuclearization and reducing tensions. As strong advocates for a diplomatic pathway to resolve the North Korea threat, we still believe there is a path forward for tough and principled diplomacy to secure, monitor, and verify the denuclearization of North Korea, the lawmakers wrote. (Politico)
Though a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the Senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. Only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. Among Biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for Medicare and expanding Obamacare. Reconciliation could also empower Democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by Republicans as well as portions of Biden's climate and immigration priorities. The Congressional Review Act also will enable Democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the Trump administration with simple majorities. Democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only Democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.
However, when it comes to priorities for this year, voters — including progressive Democrats — clearly prioritize the agenda described above, the memo continues, referring to a list of incremental measures such as limiting surprise medical bills or requiring drug companies to justify big price hikes to the government.
The press gaggle tomorrow will be at 10:30. For those of you who can't make it or weren't able to make it for space reasons, you will still be able to dial in to this number and we will just have a phone on the podium. And we will make sure that folks on the phone have an opportunity to ask questions as well as those in person for those who are concerned about that.
The Trump administration says the new border restrictions are an effort to protect the country from the spread of the coronavirus, even though Mexico has far fewer cases than the United States. We need the Wall more than ever! he tweeted last month.
A Jeb Bush flashback: The ticketed crowd of several hundred seemed at times uncertain about whether it was witnessing an academic lecture or a political barnstorm, with only a few attempts at applause during his remarks. Twice Schultz found himself asking the audience to clap, first after he praised the university for its efforts to control tuition costs and later when he pledged to release his tax returns if he declared himself a candidate.
Gillibrand rattled off several priorities, including affordable day care. Harris started with a middle-class tax cut but quickly added guns and immigration reform.
Health care is a contentious subject in Washington, but this idea largely isn't: The need to reform Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance payments so that providers are incentivized to care for patients in such a way that they will need fewer health-care services, not more of them.
5. What limits will Democrats face?
We reported to you last week that this is a Cabinet of rivals -- this is not Cabinet of rivals, rather, but a Cabinet of disrupters and doers. These are people who know how to break the status quo and that's their job and their focus.
But it's unclear whether Yarmuth will also draw from a range of Medicare-for-all plans proposed by more centrist Democrats, including ideas to include a Medicare option in the individual insurance marketplaces or allow people to join the program as early as age 55. Health policy experts say those types of bills stand a far greater chance of gaining traction.
— The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed $100 million to detecting and treating the coronavirus globally, our Post colleague Miriam Berger reports. Funds will be distributed to the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and health authorities in China and other high-risk countries.
With a near-daily string of new scandals and unfavorable headlines — including this week's news of a special counsel to examine possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — a growing number of Republicans across the country are watching dispiritedly as Democrats become further energized to turn out their voters in 2018, potentially tipping not only congressional contests but state and local races down the ballot.
The skepticism among Republicans after the plan was released Monday evening was palpable.
Wolff writes Trump was in a foul mood as he assumed office, fighting with first lady Melania Trump on Inauguration Day and bringing her to the verge of tears.
OUCH: McConnell has just this week and next if he wants to reach his goal of a health-care vote before the July 4 recess. A lot would need to happen during that time -- including actually getting legislation put together -- and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is skeptical of how such a bill is being drafted in secret and potentially rushed through.
The steepest increases in the rate of young children without health insurance between 2016 and 2018 occurred in Missouri (up 1.7 percentage points), West Virginia (1.5), Ohio and Tennessee (1.4), and Kentucky (1.3).
The Senate and its once-formidable Finance Committee are, Toomey believes, being marginalized and made irrelevant as the executive wields authority delegated to it by Congress — but without Congress insisting on compliance with the terms of the delegation. The question, Toomey says, is: Are we willing to enforce our own law that governs the proceedings of this body?
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) dismissed concerns that the GOP bill will have to undergo major revisions in the Senate — or that Republicans won't even be able to pass it in the House.
Senator Cruz, I know that you have general plans for tax reform, but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs?
But the Biden administration is eyeing how to start pulling back on work requirements in the meantime, perhaps through issuing new guidance to states on what kinds of waivers are acceptable and unacceptable.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi clarified that in her Friday meeting with the president, We did not talk about Larry Summers. And Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted, Why would we listen to the economist who admits he went too small last time if he's warning us to go small again?

They would both be great, and they are both really well-liked, said a person with close ties to the administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel matter.
The poll found 45 percent of voters say they trust Democrats in Congress on health care, compared with 35 percent who chose Republicans in Congress. A 54 percent majority of voters said they have some or a lot of trust in Democrats in Congress to protect the health-care system or improve it, compared with 41 percent who said they trust congressional Republicans or 41 percent who said they trust Trump on the issue.
He took a jab at his opponents, some of whom have been pushing for Medicare-for-all, during an interview on ABC's Good Morning America hours after he posted his campaign announcement video on his website.
Those who set up direct deposit on their tax forms will get payments sooner, the IRS said. For those who don't, or who file their taxes by mail instead of electronically, the Treasury Department plans to set up an online portal so people can provide their banking information. If you don't have a bank account, relief checks could take longer to arrive through the mail.
5:50 p.m.: Barr questioned on past writings on gay rights groups
This president and his chicken-hawk cabinet have taken us to the brink of war with Iran, Gabbard said. Chicken hawk is a term critics use to deride those who advocate for aggressive military action despite having avoided military service themselves.
The whole thing is very discouraging, she said.
Mexican authorities have announced plans to deploy security forces to a containment belt north of the Guatemalan border. Mexico in 2018 also agreed to host migrants who are applying for asylum in the United States while their cases are pending in U.S. courts, as The Washington Post reported.
OOF: Maryland's Obamacare insurers are proposing an average 30 percent increase in premiums for the individual health-plan markets for 2019, our colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield requested an 18.5 percent increase to HMO plans used by most individual plan members, and a massive 91.4 percent increase on its PPO plans. Kaiser Permanente proposed a 37.4 percent increase on HMO plans.
Smith objected primarily to Trump's emphasis on appointing conservatives to the bench, but also expressed frustration at Trump's foreign policy efforts. You're the leader of a free world and you're acting like a 14 year old boy who just got a machine gun, he said. It's appalling.
And, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.
TRUMP: One, one of the victims.
OUCH: Former White House physician Ronny Jackson was accused of bullying staff and making sexual remarks.
Fact-checking President Trump's State of the Union:
-- Sanders's rise in the polls means he'll be talking more about his electability than a revolution. While speeches he's made over the past two weeks still feature his signature call to action, he's spending more time explaining to voters how policies like Medicare-for-all would work in their daily lives, as well as how he could beat Trump. (Bloomberg News)
President Trump seems to have an obsession with size. From nuclear weapons to hand size, here are some of his remarks that fixate on being bigger. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
What's the worst thing that could happen if Bernie were president? filmmaker and Sanders surrogate Michael Moore said at rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, shortly before the state's caucuses. You get sick, and you don't lose your home, he replied in answer to his own question, implying that other candidates were less committed to ending medical bankruptcy.
During the last half-century, the Democratic Party has only won the presidency when it has resisted the temptation to pick status-quo nominees and shown the courage to choose centrist outsiders with fresh, optimistic messages, the editorial explains. Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama prevailed in part because they understood the values of real-world America. All three successfully connected with voters by tapping into the sensibilities of average Americans. Buttigieg has gained that needed perspective during his eight years leading South Bend, a Midwestern city that had to reinvent itself and cast aside a Rust Belt image.
Colorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.
If an answer existed, health-care experts say a bill probably would have manifested it by now. In the meantime, the messy process is souring Americans on something they thought they wanted. A Washington Post-ABC News poll finds half of Americans prefer Obamacare, compared to just 24 percent preferring Republicans' plan. A Kaiser Health poll finds 71 percent of Americans want Republicans to stop trying to repeal Obamacare and work with Democrats to make it better.
Becerra — who has served as California attorney general since 2019 and as a longtime Democratic congressman before that — has been widely attacked by conservatives, criticizing his past support of Medicare-for-all and his efforts to sue the Trump administration over its health-care policies, Dan writes.
Obamacare contained a similar provision. The law called for a change to the index used to calculate federal subsidies for Americans buying individual private insurance several years after taking effect. Elmendorf said that that aspect of Obamacare was also objectionable but not as consequential as the change from CPI-U to CPI-M in the GOP bill.
-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke met with the chairman of the nation's largest oil-services company — who is involved in a Montana real estate deal that was aided by a foundation Zinke established — at department headquarters. Politico's Ben Lefebvre and Nick Juliano report: The new details raise further questions about Zinke's involvement in the project, and whether his conversations with the developers — especially in Interior's office — violated federal conflict of interest laws given Halliburton's extensive business before this department. POLITICO reported Tuesday that a foundation Zinke established a decade ago agreed to let the Lesar-backed development build a parking lot on foundation land.
The judge's ruling followed a lawsuit from parents at a private school who said the county acted beyond its legal authority. They said the declaration caused 'children to be denied attendance at nursery programs and schools and has effectively prohibited their movement and denied them the right to congregate and assemble in public places,'  Frances writes.
Vitti was referring to the American Health Care Act, a bill to replace Obamacare passed by the GOP-majority House back in 2017. That measure, and a Senate bill like it, would have shifted the Medicaid program to a system where states got limited funding through either block grants or per capita caps.
The book is unexpectedly light on the topic of trade, for which he won what he calls the Swedish thingie. (Krugman won his Nobel Prize for an analysis of trade patterns.) In the introduction to his 13-page chapter on trade wars, Krugman notes that international trade and international trade policy aren't as important as people think they are, as if to justify the glossing over of what's (not) to come. But I would have loved more insight into his thinking on the flavor of free trade that has become commonplace among liberal elites in business, even as the rise of populists on the left and the right has exposed the shortcomings of globalization.
We need to be a party that basically appeals to the progressives in our party, who want change; we need to appeal to the moderates in our party, who are kind of solutions-oriented folks; and we ought to appeal to some of these disaffected Republicans, Delaney said Wednesday, at a town hall in Andover, N.H. If we build a big tent, we will win, and we will big. And we'll be able to govern.
Whoa. Silverman was sure that she hadn't so much as smudged his bumper. But, even if she had, did this man's response match the crime? Standing there, Silverman had a choice: shout back or try one of her social experiments. Could kindness convert this negative energy into something positive?

It just seems like you're going after places that are so pivotal to what you are arguing you wanted to do for your base. They're cutting all sorts of infrastructure projects and economic development projects at the same time that the president is still talking about how much of an investment he's going to put into infrastructure.
The proposal shares some themes with ideas released by Trump, but the presumptive GOP nominee has proposed much steeper rate reductions. Trump has said he would cut the top individual rate to 25 percent and the top corporate rate to 15 percent while also eliminating the estate tax. He has said he would offset the cost of the tax cuts by eliminating most deductions for individuals and businesses.

I have a very distinctive beginning story, Randy Barnett told me over eggs at a diner in Logan Circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in November. There was no Federalist Society when I was a law student, so I didn't know anything about it. I heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and I'm a libertarian — I'm not a conservative.
Shares of two of the country's three largest PBMs slipped yesterday after Verma's comments. By noon, CVS shares had dropped 2.7 percent and shares for Express Scripts were down as much as 1.6 percent, per Bloomberg News.
He added to Politico on Wednesday: What we're dealing with here is not some ordinary ideological debate during ordinary times or even during an economic downturn. It is a catastrophic collapse of the economy via government fiat.
After DeMint took over, however, some Republicans chafed at the organization's new focus on political advocacy, particularly its targeting of GOP members. Heritage Action led the charge against President Barack Obama's signature health-care law, in some cases pressuring lawmakers to vote against funding the government to prevent funding for Obamacare, a maneuver some GOP leaders saw as self-defeating.
Some form of paid family leave is mandated in six states plus the District of Columbia, said Vicki Shabo, vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families. California, which has the longest-standing leave requirements in the nation, may seek to expand its mandate to six months under a proposal expected from the state's new Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.

— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved Ohio's request to require thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries to work to qualify for benefits — it's the ninth state to get such a greenlight.
Bloomberg is seeking to pick up the mantle of electability from former vice president Joe Biden. But Biden's electability claim rested on the argument that he could bring back the coalition that put Obama in the White House. Bloomberg is anathema to virtually every element of the Obama coalition. At the Nevada debate, Bloomberg said the question for Democrats is Who can beat Donald Trump? Based on his performance, it's not at all clear that he is the answer.

They wanted to give more power to state insurance commissioners to regulate policies — while also offering insurers the freedom to ignore state regulation by selling across state lines.
Feb. 28, 2017. During an address to a joint session of Congress, Trump listed preexisting conditions as the first principle for creating a better health-care system. First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health-care exchanges.
The Cruz proposal would let insurers offer plans that do not meet market requirements under the Affordable Care Act, such as coverage for preventive care, mental health care and substance-abuse treatment.

I think his legacy on fiscal policy, on poverty policy, on entitlements is an extremely negative one, said Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden. And the best I can say about him is up until this big tax cut, he's been pretty feckless in terms of actually legislating.
Whether to support Trump's wall by backing his emergency declaration at the border is a tough call for the 22 Republicans who will be on the ballot — along with the president — next year. And Trump has urged them to STAY UNITED!
Feb. 19. In the same interview, Trump indicated that he supported the individual mandate. There was a backlash, so a day later, he tweeted he really was talking about preexisting conditions.
OUCH: Stimulus money is unlikely to speed a reopening of California schools.
If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again. (A December 2018 poll showed that, since Trump was elected in 2016, those preferring Merry Christmas over Happy Holidays actually dipped below 60 percent each year — lower than in previous surveys.)
The result galvanized Democrats, especially the campaign of Amy McGrath, the Marine veteran who is the favorite to win the party's primary and to challenge McConnell in the fall.
-- Rudy Giuliani — and his old Iranian clients — are cheering Soleimani's death. From the Daily Beast: The former New York City mayor has had a long-standing interest in Iranian affairs. He was once paid by organizations linked to an Iranian dissident group formally designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization—until Giuliani helped get the outfit off the terror list. As recently as the summer of 2018, Giuliani appeared on stage at an event for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, known by its Farsi acronym, MEK. He's stayed in touch with the group's U.S. lobbyists, meeting with representatives of its political arm as recently as last fall. And when Trump authorized the strike that killed [Soleimani], Giuliani jubilantly referred to the MEK in the first person. Soleimani was 'directly responsible for killing some of my MEK people,' he (said) in an interview on Monday afternoon. 'We don't like him very much.'
There was plenty of angst in the lower chamber, as Republican leaders explained why they were either breaking with the speaker or breaking with GOP orthodoxy on Medicaid.
Health officials warned that new variants of the coronavirus could pose a growing risk and called on Congress to quickly pass relief aid that could provide additional funding to detect the new strains of the virus. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, said that scientists expect existing vaccines to be effective against the new variants of the virus but added that the government is still working with pharmaceutical companies to develop possible booster vaccines against new strains as an additional precaution.

... and the need for change, with Governor Snyder. But here's the point. This should not be a partisan issue. The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, Oh, it's a good idea to poison some kids with lead. It's absurd. It's outrageous. It isn't true.
To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.

The Trump administration approved a dramatic overhaul of Tennessee's Medicaid financing.
In many European countries, the median covid-19 victim has been older than 80, Chico and Stefano write. In Italy, the average is 83, and the dichotomy between generations is especially stark. Even with the virus raging, the 2020 death rate for Italians 50 and younger fell compared with previous years, with lockdown measures keeping people off the roads and indoors. But the country's overall death rate nonetheless spiked some 15 percent.

The widely expected move comes as China is paralyzed by the coronavirus, Taylor writes, adding that it has brought China's powerful manufacturing industry to a standstill as travel restrictions freeze the country's workforce and major companies such as Boeing, Apple and Nike have been forced to close factories until at least mid-February. McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC, Levi Strauss, H&M and Samsung have closed stores across China. Casinos in Macao, the world's biggest gambling market, are shutting down for two weeks.

Andrew Yang: No. 1, you say to the universities, Hey, let's try and get your administrator-to-student ratio down to what it was in the 1990s, because the main reason your costs have gone up 250 percent are that your administrator-to-student ratio has gone up 150 percent. You are not spending the money on faculty. You're not spending the money on things that are actually going to impact the educational experience. You become these overgrown, complex bureaucracies where you have many, many non-faculty administrators doing jobs that did not even exist a couple of decades ago.
-- The EPA tried to limit press access to Pruitt's news conference about his decision to rollback Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. CNN's Clare Foran reports: [M]ost reporters who cover the agency weren't in the room, and cameras were nearly non-existent. … EPA had attempted to allow television camera access to Fox News without informing the other four networks: CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS. Fox alerted the networks and a pool was established allowing networks equal access to the event. … [Pruitt] did not address the controversy or take any questions from reporters.
The big question here will be whether his plan will actually involve a substantial public expenditure designed to create jobs. This suggests the opposite. And whether this can pass is anyone's guess.
We take these issues seriously and understand and appreciate the concern about the tone of these exchanges, university spokeswoman Rachel Pugh wrote in an email.

According to another 2009 study by the Institute of Medicine, people without health care are more likely to die if diagnosed with illnesses, such as cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes and heart attack, among others.
Plus, insulin is a hormone every single person needs to stay alive. For patients with Type 1 diabetes whose bodies don't produce any insulin (including your Health 202 author), access to insulin is quite literally a matter of life or death.
Murray and her colleagues are fuming at both the GOP's tax overhaul and the party's move to erase the individual mandate — and feel the measure would need to be revised to ensure that restoring the payments doesn't result in pushing lower-income people away from buying coverage.
To the extent that people are complying with the state laws, distribution and production and so forth, we're not going to go after that, Barr said.
Davidson explained that the policy announced that day would actually reduce access to care, not increase it. He expressed concern that increased out-of-pocket costs would make it harder for his patients to get insulin and other life-saving treatments.
-- Ivanka Trump's keynote address at CES — one of the world's largest technology conferences — sparked backlash. Cat Zakrzewski reports: The first daughter's keynote speech at CES made a pitch for programs that would help blue-collar workers keep pace with a rapidly evolving economy and addressed strategies to re-skill workers, develop apprenticeships and invest in science and technology education programs. Trump has focused on workforce development in her work as adviser to the president, and she serves with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as the co-chair of the National Council for the American Worker. … Inside the room, her comments drew applause. But the inclusion of Trump in the speaker lineup sparked some backlash in the tech industry, as critics said there are women with more technical experience who are better qualified to speak there. Hundreds of people have tweeted #boycottCES since the conference organizers announced Trump would speak at the show late last month, including on Tuesday. Some were particularly critical because the conference drew widespread criticism in both 2017 and 2018 for failing to bring in female keynote speakers, part of a longer track record.
-- A mask-clad Xi Jinping emerged from a conspicuous absence to visit the coronavirus front line at a facility in Beijing. Rick Noack reports: Photos and videos of the visit — carried by state-run news agencies and television stations — did not deviate from the usual pattern of publicity appearances by Xi and other Chinese Communist Party officials. But Xi's appearance Monday capped a remarkably unengaged period for the Chinese leader at a critical time, during which he conspicuously avoided public attention. … Xi left it to other Communist Party officials to calm concerns over the novel coronavirus or to celebrate tireless medical workers…. Keeping a low profile may no longer be a viable option for Xi, as his absence has fueled speculation and as public scrutiny has increasingly turned away from local cadres' failings and toward more systemic complaints over the ruling Communist Party in Beijing.
Yogananda Pittman, the acting Capitol Police chief, testified before the House Appropriations Committee this morning:
TRUMP: You haven't employed one person.
The co-ops had a few initial bright moments, in some cases offering monthly premiums significantly lower than those of commercial insurers. But their problems quickly mounted. Some increased enrollment too quickly and couldn't keep up with the rising costs. Others failed to gain enough members.
Grants to state and local governments is one place to look. The measure allocates $350 billion in aid to states, cities and counties, supposedly to address pandemic-created revenue shortfalls. New data, however, shows that state budgets have been much less affected by the pandemic than had been expected, with some even showing an increase in revenue from the year before. Any aid should be predicated on a showing of fiscal need, not an open-ended subsidy. Hundreds of billions of dollars could be shaved from the package by applying this simple test.
— Yesterday, the House Veterans Affairs Committee passed a plan 20-2 to give veterans increased freedom to see doctors outside of the VA health system and to fix a budget crisis in its troubled private-sector program. The plan goes toward fulfilling President Trump's campaign promise to expand private care options for veterans, The Associated Press's Hope Yen writes.
Drawing parallels to the Watergate era, Coons noted then-attorney general nominee Elliot Richardson, who resigned when ordered to fire a special prosecutor, had made vast commitments to Congress about that prosecutor's independence, and Coons asked if Barr would do the same.
This appears to be yet another step by the Trump administration to undermine health care markets, which means higher premiums for families and those who need health care the most, said Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.

Pelosi's office defended her response to Trump's attacks on Omar. A spokesman noted that Pelosi was traveling to Europe on Friday when Trump issued his tweet about a single phrase of Omar's that some people did something on 9/11 and that the speaker did express solidarity with the freshman lawmaker Saturday, writing: The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence.
About 400,000 women a year get breast implants, with 75 percent for cosmetic reasons and the other fourth for reconstruction after breast-cancer surgery.
Trump's campaign is conducting a broad messaging survey to help guide its efforts, according to three people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations. In addition to trade, health care and immigration, officials said, the campaign is likely to focus on economic growth, criminal justice reform and the president's support for Israel.
Yes! There is palpable relief that she's back in charge, said one analyst. You'd have joyous celebration if they made her permanent director.

Starting in 2025, however, the Senate bill would change the formula, instead funding Medicaid based on a measure of how rapidly all costs are rising (technically, the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, or just CPI-U).
The mayor had been critical of both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. He decided to back Obama shortly after Hurricane Sandy hammered New York and parts of the East Coast, calling climate change an urgent issue. A Bloomberg campaign official said the former mayor voted for Obama both times and that the 2012 endorsement was designed to flip or lock down voters who still hadn't committed to Obama by the last days of the campaign.

Still, experts say that vaccinations need to ramp up quickly. As long as the virus is still circulating, immune pressure can spark the emergence of new variants.
The lesson of the co-ops is that insurance is a tricky business, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health. Just like you wouldn't ask your cousin to do brain surgery on you, you probably wouldn't ask your cousin to underwrite your health risk.
Timing: Biden had spoken to more than a dozen other heads of state, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, before calling Xi, raising questions about whether Washington was giving Beijing a head start on ramming through its foreign policy and trade initiatives, Biden had spoken to more than a dozen other heads of state, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, before calling Xi, raising questions about whether Washington was giving Beijing a head start on ramming through its foreign policy and trade initiatives, Politico's Natasha Bertrand writes . The officials acknowledged that the new administration is 'being very careful in our initial interactions with China,' but said the preparatory discussions with allies had put Biden in a strong position to negotiate with his Chinese counterpart.

If you're in an area hit hard by covid, those are the areas most likely to have a protocol or directive requiring the service provider not to transport to the closest hospital, North said.
We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
See, there's people in this country -- and Ted's right -- their wages haven't gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they're not moving. And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money. They receive none. And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.
Cruz repeated Valde's story, that by the time Valde's brother-in-law went to a doctor, he was already dying.
The rule is part of a broader overhaul of government assistance programs arising from an executive order Trump signed in 2018 directing federal agencies to strengthen existing work requirements and introduce new ones for low-income Americans receiving Medicaid, food stamps, public housing benefits and welfare.
We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.
And at some point, the government has to say, wait a minute, this is all functioning as a massive system of taxation on our people. And that's not right. These organizations have to actually start trying to keep the public good in mind and not just their own growth. So this is all a long-winded way of saying we need to treat adjunct professors better because these universities will not do it themselves.
When their next boy arrived last year, the couple had health insurance purchased through the law's federal exchange. Smith estimates he and his wife paid about $7,000 in premiums and $6,000 out of pocket for the actual birth. It was a wash financially, he thought, but in other ways it was worse. They had to change hospitals because the one they'd used for their first child would not accept their new insurance. They had to change pediatricians, too.
I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.
Just about every Republican I know who is in business is apoplectic about the prospect of Trump as president, but they are also afraid of him, one former chief executive said. They don't want to put their companies in harm's way.
The president-elect will then hold a joint meeting with Congressman Tom Price, the secretary-designate for health and human services; Seema Verma, the nominee for administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and Vice President-elect Pence.
In a short interview last week, Meadows said he had met with more than a dozen senators beyond Cruz and Lee. And in a separate interview with the HuffPost, Meadows talked up an amendment from Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) that would actually expand tax credits, suggesting that even hard-liners could be sold on it.
It took years of therapy for Silverman to see how so much was wrapped up in her mother. After Beth Ann died, of a rare autoimmune disease in 2015, Laura told her of the wall display of videotapes in their mother's home, documenting each screen credit, whether in Wreck-It Ralph or The Larry Sanders Show. This was stunning information.

Actually, no matter how hard politicians try to spin it, the percentage of people with two or more jobs has been around 5 percent for almost a decade. Democrats suggesting this is something new — in an era of unusually low unemployment — are misleading their supporters.
The jury determined that Weinstein forced oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi at his apartment in July 2006 and raped former aspiring actress Jessica Mann at a hotel in 2013, Shayna Jacobs reports. He was found not guilty of the most severe charges, of predatory sexual assault, which would have acknowledged a pattern that included forcing sex on actress Annabella Sciorra in 1993 or 1994. Weinstein, 67, faces at least five years and up to 25 on the count of first-degree criminal sex act for his assault on Haleyi, and up to four years on a third-degree rape count for the Mann encounter. The judge can consider running the sentences consecutively, for a maximum of 29 years. Sentencing is scheduled for March 11. After the verdict announcement, Weinstein was handcuffed and taken to jail, and his bail was revoked.
CRUZ: Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates. This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other. This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.
-- Trump reportedly sidelined his top negotiator on North Korea and dismissed warnings from his top intelligence officials before meeting with Kim Jong Un in Vietnam last month. Time's John Walcott reports: In recent days, Trump shut down an effort by Stephen Biegun, nominally the Administration's lead negotiator with Pyongyang, to reestablish a back channel through the North's United Nations mission in New York, according to four U.S. and South Korean officials.
We commend Speaker Paul Ryan on his continued resolve to fund women's health care, not abortion, she said.
Shortly before midnight, Saccone told his supporters that it's not over yet.
Big stories in the entertainment world as they break.
In Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America's Heartland, Metzl, a professor at Vanderbilt University, uses compelling data and focus-group interviews to show how white people are willing to die rather than be connected to or finance policies that they believe are giving resources to people they view as undeserving. Metzl opens the book recounting his conversation with a man he refers to as Trevor, a 41-year-old Tennessee man who was dying from liver damage and who was adamantly opposed to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

To provide more time to complete action on important legislative items and process nominees that have been stalled by a lack of cooperation from our friends across the aisle, the Senate will delay the start of the August recess until the third week of August, McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement.
All this has forced the Trump White House to back down in some respects. The White House reversed course on applying the measure to current green card holders, and Trump is making reassuring noises about the measure ending on schedule. And so, we can presume the Trump White House might pause before continuing or expanding this proposal or launching other ones like it. We can hope, anyway.
Feinstein pressed Barr to do whatever he can to bring Mueller's findings to Congress and the public, while cautioning that Justice Department regulations argue against making public a report from Mueller.
Sure, Democrats' sensitivity about racial and ethnic identity may play a part in concern about her candidacy. That doesn't really get to the nub of the problem, however. Likewise, most Democrats seem to accept her assertion that she never got a job because of her claim to have Native American ancestry. So what's the problem?
In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
-- Inslee said he would be willing to declare a national emergency on climate change, allowing drastic federal action that could not pass Congress, if the Supreme Court upholds President Trump's emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern border. The governor emphasized that he's against Trump's invocation of emergency powers and hopes it gets struck down. But if the rules change and the circumstances change, we're going to play by whatever rules exist to deal with this existential crisis, he said. So if the possibility exists, we'll say yes.

If they don't govern and get some concrete results, it's going to be a long couple of years, Reed said, referring to the party's electoral prospects. This is the beginning of a lot of dominoes that will fall one way or another.
The increasing polarization of the abortion issue will be on stark display at today's protest, where just one Democratic member of Congress is scheduled to speak: Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.). While several dozen House and Senate Democrats identified as antiabortion rights back in 1990s, just a handful do now. Besides Lipinski — who was snubbed by his party in a primary challenge last year — they include Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.
— Shutdown watch. The Post's Erica Werner and Mike DeBonis: House Republican leaders presented their rank and file with a one-month spending bill Tuesday aimed at keeping the government open ahead of a Friday night deadline, as hopes for a deal on young undocumented immigrants faded. The bill would extend existing spending levels through Feb. 16 and include an extension of a popular children's health insurance program — aimed at winning Democratic votes — and a new sweetener for conservatives and Democrats alike in delaying several taxes included in the Affordable Care Act. Few lawmakers were enthusiastic about the legislation, but several described it as a necessary evil to avoid the first government shutdown since 2013... [Leaders] planned to test support Wednesday and bring the bill to a vote Thursday, according to multiple members. It was not immediately clear whether they would be successful.
Biden would raise taxes on several fronts to finance his domestic agenda but says only people earning $400,000 or more would pay a higher amount. His best chance to implement his tax-hike plan would likely be if Democrats win big in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, increasing their majorities in the House and Senate.
Ryan is among the millions of Americans encountering surprisingly large tax bills in the midst of a global health crisis. She was finally able to go back to work at a day-care center, but she says she doesn't have $3,100. She used what savings she had to move from Pennsylvania to New Jersey when a job opened up in her field.
There's another category of Trump target that we haven't mentioned yet and that may increasingly apply as the months pass: those who were a focus of opposition by Trump but who won reelection anyway.
Wilbur Ross has spent his career strengthening the manufacturing sector by saving and creating jobs in industries like auto parts, building materials, telecommunications, textiles, steel and coal. He will be the administration's policy leader when it comes to renegotiating and negotiating better trade deals for the American workers, teaming up with the next United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, who will be in the White House as the point person on trade issues.

From a press secretary at the Human Rights Campaign:
These goals would be a call to action by all 50 states and the District of Columbia to heal our nation: to stitch together our societal fabric and rekindle common cause. This will require cooperation across ideological, racial, spiritual, geographic and income divisions to foster a healthy civic marketplace and new partnerships. The interconnected goals for America would use specific data-driven, measurable policy aims with bipartisan buy-in and the collaboration of public, private and nonprofit sectors working in tandem with activists, educators, volunteers and community leaders. Goals would include meeting a variety of civic benchmarks such as emotional prosperity, health and well-being, civility and good works, gender equity, clean water and sanitation, food security, infrastructure innovations (such as universal broadband), housing, literacy and equal justice. Economic benefits could be made available to state and local governments for successful efforts. It took all hands to divide the country. Now we need all hands to undo the damage. The Domestic Sustainable Society Goals would take advantage of this unprecedented moment in American history to accelerate action together.

Trump's turn to protectionism, whether provoked by annoyance at certain advisers or simply a reflection of his economic illiteracy, has, to put it mildly, prompted international consternation and some of the strongest conservative pushback of his presidency. The Wall Street Journal editorial board, which has bent over backward to support him, decried the move. Donald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his Presidency Thursday by announcing that next week he'll impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum., the board wrote. This tax increase will punish American workers, invite retaliation that will harm U.S. exports, divide his political coalition at home, anger allies abroad, and undermine his tax and regulatory reforms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7% on the news, as investors absorbed the self-inflicted folly. The markets were down again Friday, although by a lesser amount than Thursday.
TRUMP: We've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave. Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.
And if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial...
I think he said what he wanted, but pragmatically, I don't know how he's going to get it through Congress, he said.
States, which now pay about a third of the cost of the program, have long had the flexibility to propose different ways of covering the poor, and the federal government has approved a variety of such experiments. But the way most states have been found to restrain Medicaid costs is to pay doctors and hospitals less than all other insurers pay. The result is that hospitals charge other insurers and patients higher rates to make up the difference, while the number of doctors who are willing to take Medicaid patients has shrunk.
If you are a moderate Republican worried about defending your district in 2018 in what is historically a very tough first midterm election for the president's party, these numbers will frighten you.
The Byrd Rule is largely what keeps policymakers from just passing an entire Obamacare repeal/replace bill under reconciliation and calling it a day.
McConnell on Feb. 24, 2010: Democrats on Capitol Hill are working behind the scenes on a plan aimed at jamming this massive health spending bill through Congress against the clear wishes of an unsuspecting public. What they have in mind is a last-ditch legislative sleight-of-hand called reconciliation that would enable them to impose government-run health care for all on the American people, whether Americans want it or not.
OUCH: E.coli in contaminated romaine lettuce has killed one person in California, the first known death in the weeks-long, nationwide outbreak. The infections have spread to 25 states and sickened a total of 121 people, the CDC said yesterday. That's 23 more people and three more states since the CDC's latest update on Friday, our colleague Joel Achenbach reports. With the numbers ratcheting up every week, this outbreak is approaching the scale of the 2006 baby spinach E. coli illness outbreak, in which 205 people became sick and five of them died, Joel writes.
There is no discussion of circumcision in Yang's stump speech. Instead, he tells audiences that he spent a career in business (and six months as a lawyer) and saw firsthand the decline in America that fueled the rise of right-wing populism.
It's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. We are encouraged, hopeful. The issue isn't buried. Candidates speak about it. It's not a movement in the ghetto. After eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the White House at the start of the administration — I felt like I was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.
The memo did not include the disciplines of any of the specialists, Anne writes. Typically, a physical exam includes checks of height, weight, blood pressure and other standard measures. Trump said last year that he takes a statin drug to manage his cholesterol.
On the campaign trail, candidates often hear complaints from voters frustrated by rising drug prices, staggering and widely inconsistent medical bills, skyrocketing deductibles, unaffordable premiums, and difficult-to-conquer bureaucracies, creating pressure to offer a sweeping overhaul plan, Annie writes. But the candidates' slogans inevitably prove difficult to implement. And often it's not exactly clear what those slogans meant to begin with.
Warren, Castro pressed on abortion: All the candidates onstage favor abortion rights, but both Warren and Castro were pressed on their views. Castro cast his stance as I believe in reproductive justice, earning applause from the crowd. He also pointed out that abortion is an issue in the transgender community.
The podcast has been more than an opportunity for self-analysis. It has become a lifeline. Silverman's last gathering with friends was in early December, a masked, socially distanced poker game to celebrate her 50th birthday. (This included scheduling multiple coronavirus tests for the participants in the lead-up.) Now her physical circle has shrunk to her boyfriend, Rory Albanese, a comedy writer and television producer who moved to L.A. from New York last year, and her dog, Mary.

But the battle isn't done. The United Nations — whose founding pacts underwrite a 75-year-old liberal order binding all nations — remains a bulwark against authoritarianism, provided the United States can fortify its values and revive its relevance. The Biden administration should push forward, fully funding its commitments, rejoining the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council, and deploying top-flight diplomatic talent to U.N. posts worldwide. It should marshal support for new initiatives to buttress free speech in the digital age, confront the risks of artificial intelligence and mass surveillance, and better protect journalists, artists and dissidents. Ambassador-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a venerated former career Foreign Service officer, is well positioned to integrate U.N. priorities into U.S. bilateral relations and seize on regional realignments to address the sore point of Israel's anomalous treatment. Sophisticated media and public engagement strategies can reignite popular appreciation for what the United Nations stands for.
What's becoming clearer is that Medicaid — which is sometimes stigmatized as only for poor people — has become a popular program, one that has touched the lives of far more people than you might have expected. A recent Kaiser poll found that 71 percent of Americans have been covered by Medicaid themselves or had a child covered, or have a friend or family member who participated in it.
Al Franken and Jeff Sessions squared off on Weekend Update:
These days, what animates the fringes of both parties is the fantasy that they can win elections by throwing out bold, ideologically divisive proposals and then, once in office, using the stick of party discipline to run over the opposition and foist these policies on a still skeptical and badly divided public. In an era of winner-take-all tribalism, building broad public consensus, accepting half a loaf, taking things one step at a time — these are dismissed out of hand.
-- Several campaigns, wary of working with the Democratic National Committee, have set up a shadow voter protection program in New Hampshire for today. They will use a neutral boiler room helmed by former Obama adviser Quentin Palfrey to share reports of voter rights infringements from legal observers across the state. (Politico)
We hear from patients every day who are being forced to choose between buying groceries and taking lifesaving drugs, the group's founder David Mitchell said in a statement. Americans are hurt, angry, and demand action from Washington. The group, which calls itself P4ADNOW, says it will spend more than seven figures in this year's midterm elections to support candidates committed to bringing down the high cost of prescription drugs and providing relief to patients.
The individual market has always had a lot of flux – people drop out when they get a job that provides health insurance – so the attrition rate likely would not have been unusual if HHS had not manipulated the numbers. An HHS spokeswoman said the report eventually will be updated with the full March data but otherwise would not explain why the report was done differently than in the past.
-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo contradicted Trump by saying that North Korea remains a nuclear threat. Felicia Sonmez and Toluse Olorunnipa report: Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper whether he believes North Korea remains a nuclear threat, Pompeo responded, 'Yes.' After last year's summit with Kim in Singapore, Trump tweeted, 'There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea...' But Pompeo on Sunday disputed that Trump had said as much. 'What he said was that the efforts that had been made in Singapore — this commitment that Chairman Kim made — have substantially taken down the risks to the American people. It's the mission of the secretary of state and the president of the United States to keep the American people secure. We're aiming to achieve that,' the secretary of state said.
That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.
OOF: Senate Democrats are planning to raise a ruckus this week as their Republican counterparts seek to move forward on an Obamacare overhaul, CNN reports.
As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the ACA lawsuit, Trump has opted not to release a replacement health-care proposal should the law be thrown out. He has said he would put forward comprehensive health-care legislation only after the upcoming election, and only if Republicans regain full control of Congress. A final ruling from the Supreme Court could come next year.
It is a Sunday morning in Columbus, a city near the Georgia-Alabama line. Covid-19 restrictions have forced the event at St. James into the parking lot, where the amens have been replaced by gratuitous horn-honking.
Mr. Bharara's investigation clearly stuck with Mr. Cuomo as well, The Times notes. In the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration, Mr. Cuomo, who has done little to hide his frustration with Mr. Bharara, told a Trump adviser in passing that the prosecutor was 'a bad guy,' saying, 'Preet is not your friend,' according to a person familiar with the discussion. (A Cuomo spokeswoman denied that the governor had made such a statement.)

The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense holds a hearing on Defense health programs.
The White House and congressional Democrats are staring down a March 14 deadline when enhanced unemployment benefits will expire unless the relief legislation is signed into law first, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. The House passed the bill on Saturday, allowing just two weeks to get it through the Senate, where it's likely to undergo some changes, and then back to the House for final passage.
OOF: The original manuscript of the Alcoholics Anonymous book — lost for decades and containing handwritten notes by its primary writer Bill Wilson and his friends — has been sold at auction for $2.4 million to billionaire Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who attended his first AA meeting 25 years ago, The Post's Gillian Brockell writes.
As for sending back to the lower court the question of whether the rest of the law remains intact, King wrote: Answering that question should be easy, since Congress removed the coverage requirement's only enforcement mechanism but left the rest of the Affordable Care Act in place.
U.S. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who chairs the committee that oversees U.S. territories including Puerto Rico, urged the Trump administration to release remaining federal disaster recovery funds from Hurricane Maria and deliver new aid quickly. 'The Trump administration's indifference and incompetence have already cost residents of Puerto Rico their lives and their livelihoods, and continuing that pattern now is completely unacceptable,' Grijalva said in a statement. 'I urge this administration to remember that lives are at stake and the public is watching.'
The White House is also attempting to build support for the Senate bill written by Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and the panel's ranking Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, that for the first time would require drugmakers to pay back the federal government if they raised the prices of medications in the Medicare program in excess of the rate of inflation. It would also limit out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.

Barr said that he would not stand by and allow a U.S. attorney to be fired for the purpose of stopping an investigation — but stressed that Trump is free to fire his officials that he's appointed.
Moreover, he said, even if the requirement to purchase health insurance is now questionable, the Supreme Court should stick to its usual course of action and retain as much of the rest of the Affordable Care Act as possible.
On Monday, Wilson, the South Carolina congressman, also answered questions on topics including environmental concerns such as climate change and Trump's military strike against Syria, according to the Post and Courier.
Some Republican lawmakers focused on a different issue — the possibility that flavor bans can spur the rise of a black market that might raise safety risks for consumers.
Like the agriculture association health plans being funded in the House farm bill, these co-ops were also seeded with federal money and operated as nonprofit organizations. The federal government lent them $2.4 billion to get up and running, and got very little of that back as they folded one by one.

Texas, another non-expansion state, had by far the highest number of uninsured children younger than 6, about 198,000, and the second-highest rate of uninsured kids of that age (8.3 percent), behind Alaska (9.2 percent).
Trump's ownership of the bill is being widely praised by some Republicans. He's all in, gushed Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). It was the right thing for the president to take ownership of it, enthused Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). Meanwhile, other Republicans report that Trump has made an aggressive pitch to them for the bill, arguing that they will face a voter backlash in 2018 if they don't deliver on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
But public opinion has shifted away from privacy for the president, the poll found. Respondents were divided evenly on whether a president should be required to release his health information or whether he should be allowed to withhold it. In a 2004 survey, 61 percent of Americans favored presidential privacy while 38 percent thought the president should release all medical information that might affect his or her ability to serve.
You'd be forgiven for assuming that this is the sort of place where Donald Trump would have been successful in the 2016 election. Unless, that is, you know that shipping and manufacturing left New York County a very long time ago. New York County is Manhattan; the warehouses are now art galleries and the skyscrapers where piecemeal manufacturing once took place are now offices and expensive apartments.
During a one-hour meeting in 2014, Sanders told American prisoner Alan Gross, who was jailed by the communist regime for five years, that he didn't understand why others criticized Cuba, Gross alleged in an interview with NPR: He said, quote: 'I don't know what's so wrong with this country.' Sanders's campaign declined to comment about the meeting with Gross, who said two other senators were present. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said he did not recall the discussion. A source close to former senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) told NPR she remembers Sanders seemed to disregard the meeting with Gross and that an uncomfortable exchange occurred, but she did not recall the exact remark.
Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted: One party wants to expand Medicare and Medicaid and the other wants to cut them. That's the end of my tweet.
Senator Cotton, do you support repealing the Affordable Care Act so that 300,000 Arkansas citizens will lose their health care? a woman asked him at a town hall meeting here this year. She was referring to the state's unique Medicaid expansion initiative created under the ACA, in which more than 300,000 people have enrolled.
Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
—And here are a few more good reads:
I won't try to tackle whether that is a good or bad thing for democracy — or our culture — in this space today. But what I will say is that Trump's decision, amid turmoil inside and outside his White House, to turn his fire on the media was a deeply predictable move.
So far, Republicans have taken the first steps toward repealing the law through budget reconciliation, a process by which only a simple majority is needed in the Senate. The process would enable them to dismantle aspects of the law that involve federal spending.
Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obama's health-care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details — lower numbers, much lower deductibles — he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
ACA health plans were created under the 2010 law for individuals and families who cannot get affordable health benefits through a job. During the Trump administration, the window for buying insurance through HealthCare.gov, an online insurance-buying system, was narrowed to six weeks near the end of each year.
Victoria Miles, an African American woman from Baltimore, said Edwards impressed her with her story of raising a son alone, facing financial troubles and mounting a successful run for Congress. You can't tell nobody anything if you ain't been through anything, Miles said.
The removal of restrictions led to mask required signs coming down from business windows across both states. It has alarmed public health experts, who have warned that it is too early to loosen up precautions.
Last week, the Club came out in vocal opposition to a package of bills to fight climate change from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The bills would increase government spending to support carbon capture technologies that seek to sequester carbon emissions before they reach the atmosphere. They also include the Trillion Trees Act, which commits the United States to an aggressive tree-planting initiative to capture carbon the old-fashioned way, by storing it in wood.
Miller has found himself fantasizing about traveling back in time to warn Trump's enablers about what the future would hold. Perhaps if he could explain that in the future the president of the United States would tell his people the election was stolen, that he'd urge them to take their fight to the Capitol, and that after they attacked carrying flags bearing his name, Trump would tell them he loved them. Maybe then, all this could be avoided.
Reporters also have some hope that media relations with HHS might improve in the Azar era. Although most reporters will tell you the Obama administration was hardly perfect when it came to communicating with the press, things got even worse under Price and after his departure.

The most significant avenue available for the government to influence drug prices is through Medicare's prescription drug program, which covers about 42 million elderly and disabled Americans. Prices for medicines offered in these Medicare Part D plans are negotiated between pharmaceutical companies and the private insurers who bid for the right to sell the program's plans.

For his part, Trump is borrowing language that Ryan . . . has used about modernizing Medicare, but not with any specificity, Wilensky said. She also noted that the president-elect's time frame was slightly skewed, since the first baby boomers began to retire five years ago.

He proposed on April Fools' Day, four months after they'd first met. It seemed appropriate. That's how Amy knew him then and even now — impulsive and puckish. … And then there were the pranks: the remote-controlled cockroach in the kitchen, the 'Psycho'-style scares in the shower. One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant turd from one of their kids' diapers and put it in a bowl, telling Amy it was avocado.
-- The White House also stonewalled the Government Accountability Office when the independent congressional watchdog requested information about the freeze on Ukraine aid. From Politico: The White House responded to the [GAO's] inquiry with a one-page letter on Dec. 20, citing a legal memo from the Office of Management and Budget that defended the hold on military aid as necessary to ensure spending the funds wouldn't 'conflict with the President's foreign policy.' … The correspondence is part of what led GAO to … conclude last week that Trump's decision to withhold military aid violated federal law.

What's more, as Georgetown Public Policy Review has noted, Among the varieties of residential housing, single-family houses are by far the most environmentally destructive, with a carbon footprint that far outstrips multifamily housing. Nevertheless, huge swaths of America are zoned for single-family housing only. Today, the multifamily residence can house an elective family as easily as a biological one — any sort of pod, really. In a land of increasing alienation, it fosters connection and well-being; it expands our social options. Why not support multifamily housing with tax deductions, loans and grants? It is good for the soul and good for America. Gish Jen's most recent novel, The Resisters, is out in paperback this month.
That's not good for this bill's chances. The 24 million number is a big reason the first bill never came up for a vote in the House: Moderate Republicans couldn't vote for a bill that meant more people would lose their insurance than gained it under Obamacare (about 20 million).
With respect to the discussions last night, as far as the tax reform, again I think that one of the things you're going to see is the president-elect isn't going to just focus on one thing. He's got a lot of priorities, a lot of change that he wants to bring to Washington.
The letter to the FTC chairman and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker also calls for consumer protection should the merger be finalized.
Clinton calmly ripped into the Republican National Convention, saying she found most offensive the party's open embrace of conversion therapy — a controversial treatment program intended to change a person's sexuality. In other words, child abuse, she said.
Many black voters draw a clear distinction between Obama and Biden. Steven Lykes, 44, a full-time caretaker, is torn between Sanders and Steyer. He backed Hillary Clinton in the primary four years ago, and his favorite candidate had been Elizabeth Warren for much of the past year. Lykes thinks the senator from Massachusetts is an amazing debater and loves her plans, but Warren's lackluster finishes in the first three states gave him pause.
Meanwhile, Cuomo's administration tried to tarnish the credibility of Lindsey Boylan, the first woman to publicly accuse the governor of sexual harassment, the New York Times's Maggie Haberman and Jesse McKinley report.
The new administration notched a fleeting breakthrough this week when advocates for immigrants agreed to stand down on several crucial lawsuits involving migrant families and unaccompanied children, giving the administration 30 more days to put new policies in place.
Graham warned Barr that he'll face tough questioning about a memo he sent to senior Justice Department officials that criticized Mueller's investigation.
Senator Sinema, like so many Democrats, was elected last year in large part due to a wave powered by women voters who wanted to put a check on this runaway Administration, she continued. So to use one of her first acts in office to help elevate a judge with a clear anti-choice record is beyond troubling.
On Monday, Barr offered a preview of what he plans to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearing — releasing four pages of written testimony in which he vowed to let Mueller finish his investigation.
They should dismiss the charges outright. It's a sham, Gordon said. If McConnell runs the trial the way the Democrats want, people here are not going to be happy.

The proposal will call for universal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, our colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.
Still, Trump's comment — a sharp departure from his campaign promises — is undercutting the efforts of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to collect 50 GOP votes to support the current bill. Conservative Republicans are calling for separate efforts, urging quick action to undo Obamacare to allow more time for the difficult endeavor of structuring its replacement.
-- For Warren and Democrats, it comes down to a question of fairness. Trump's presidency is, in one sense, a function of random geographic lines, Philip Bump observes. Blue states that voted for Clinton tend to be home to large cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Clinton ran up the vote in Los Angeles — but it did no good, since California was always safe for her, anyway. In 2016, Democrats had more than 11 million wasted votes, votes above the margin needed in each state to carry it for Clinton. Republicans wasted about 8 million. Move 78,000 of those votes — 0.7 percent of them — to Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Clinton is the president.
I was convinced the governor was telling the pilot to shake it, Stanley said, who through nervous laughter jokingly agreed to expand Medicaid if Northam could make it stop.
-- The cancer death rate in the United States fell 2.2 percent in 2017 – the biggest one-year drop ever – propelled by gains against lung cancer, the American Cancer Society said. Laurie McGinley reports: Declines in the mortality rate for lung cancer have accelerated in recent years in response to new treatments and falling smoking rates, said Rebecca Siegel, lead author of Cancer Statistics 2020. … Because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, accounting for 1 in 4, any change in the mortality rate has a large effect on the overall cancer death rate, Siegel noted. She described the gains against lung cancer, and against another often deadly cancer, melanoma, as 'exciting.' But, she added, 'the news this year is mixed' because of slower progress against colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.
Warren supporter Terie Norelli, the former Democratic speaker of the New Hampshire House, also complained about this. When I went out on the campaign trail, I kept hearing from people who would say, 'Oh, I'm so nervous. I don't want Donald Trump to win,' she recalled. They'd say the only the thing I care about is beating Donald Trump. And I was like: We don't have a crystal ball. But we have something really important, and that's a first-in-the-nation primary vote. So I decided that I would focus on who was going to be the best president. … And then I realized: She can also win.
Overall, Obamacare raised the average income of the poorest income bracket by nearly 4 percent. The law lifted the income of the second poorest bracket (with an average annual income of $42,000) by about 1 percent.

— Food companies are timing advertisements for soda for the days states distribute food stamp benefits, a new study finds. Shoppers are two to four times as likely to come across soda displays in the store when food stamps go out, our colleague Caitlin Dewey reports. The research is the latest to suggest there's more to America's nutrition gap than a lack of healthy choices or health education, Caitlin writes. Low-income Americans drink far more soda than wealthier people, according to the CDC. Some are calling on the federal government to ban soda purchases using food stamps.
-- Stat du jour: Trump has visited a Trump property one out of every three days he has been president, the equivalent of three weeks of his just-over-nine week tenure as commander in chief. (Philip Bump has a breakdown of all his visits here.)
-- As the Trump agenda stalls, the blame game being played out inside the White House is intensifying – with recriminations that extend far beyond last week's health care implosion. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: Senior aides are lashing each other over their inability to stem a never-ending tide of negative stories about the president. There is second-guessing of the RNC's efforts to mobilize Trump's electoral coalition on behalf of his legislative priorities. At the EPA, a top official quit recently amid accusations the department is failing to advance the president's campaign promises. And one of Trump's most generous benefactors, Rebekah Mercer, has expressed frustration over the direction of the administration. [Trump aides and confidantes] … described a distracting and toxic atmosphere, with warring power centers blaming one another for an ever-growing list of setbacks. The dysfunction has further paralyzed an administration struggling to deliver on its blunt promises of wholesale change. The environment, many Trump aides are convinced, has been created by the president himself … As Trump's health care plan ran into problems, he found ways to divert blame — sometimes turning on his own staff.
A recent report from the CDC shows the significant decline in annual HIV infections has stalled. The report provides the most recent data on HIV trends in the United States, from 2010 to 2016. It shows that after about five years of substantial declines, the number of HIV infections began to level off in 2013 at about 39,000 per year.

That was the opposite of Deborah Akel, also a Bernie supporter, who decided not to vote in the 2016 general election. If she could do it over again, she would give Clinton her support. She was open to Trump before the election because she appreciated his broader message.
In 2016, Iowa voters delivered a victory to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who single-handedly shut down the government trying to defund Obamacare. New Hampshire voters then made Donald Trump's candidacy plausible, rather than a fringe expression of racial animus. On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist who advocates radical changes to the American economy, fought former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to a tie in Iowa and won New Hampshire. Now Sanders has repeated his feat from four years ago, battling to a virtual tie in Iowa with former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and winning New Hampshire, albeit far more narrowly than last time.
The CBO report does note that measuring the uninsured rate is a challenging task, Sarah writes. It largely relies on survey data that Americans submit, rather than measuring enrollment in government programs, for example, where the agency can turn to administrative data sources. Still, this report isn't the first to sound alarm bells about a rising uninsured rate.
Increasingly, the president is aided by reports churned out by the Department of Health and Human Services, which under President Barack Obama used to issue dubious reports defending the law but now offers dubious reports to undermine it.
I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.
It's not a sustainable model, said Amy Compton-Phillips, Providence's executive vice president and chief clinical officer. The challenge is trying to do the right thing between what the need is and what you're allowed to do from a regulatory standpoint.
Immediately stop the killing of police officers. It's going to stop, okay? It's going to stop. We're going to be law and order. It's going to stop. (Police officer deaths didn't stop, and they actually were on the high end during much of Trump's presidency.)
The GOP bill would also make a number of other changes to the health-care system. Coming up with an exact number for the effect of changing the measure of inflation is complicated. And while the Congressional Budget Office has said it will publish forecasts for the Republican bill next week, its report might not reflect the effects of using the overall price index instead of just the medical component.

No business group was more enthusiastic in taking up the offer than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which over the next 20 years increasingly aligned its rhetoric, positions and political contributions with the Republican caucuses in Congress — and, beginning in 2001, with the Bush White House. By 2014, only six Democrats were included among the 268 candidates the Chamber endorsed that election cycle, when the Chamber allocated all but $500,000 of its $35.5 million to Republican candidates. In March of that year, the Chamber's political director told the Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader, The No. 1 priority of the U.S. Chamber's political program is to make Mitch McConnell the majority leader of the U.S. Senate.

DnD: Dungeons & Dragons — in which players assume the roles of adventurers engaged in an epic quest. The game plays out mostly in the players' imaginations, possibly while they sit around a basement table in the 1980s or try to be retro with their friends.

It would not, however, be a leap to say that losing health insurance would make someone's health worse and might even lead to death. Studies have drawn connections between lack of access to health care and mortality rate.
Annie compares the remarks in part to President Barack Obama, who was criticized for saying about the ACA before it was implemented: If you like your health-care plan, you'll be able to keep your health-care plan.
Newsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.
John Roberts released a statement criticizing Chuck Schumer.
Indeed, a quick check will find why a company's stock price increased – and it had nothing to do with Obamacare. United Health, for instance, hit the jackpot with its Optum subsidiary, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services. CVS said it would buy Aetna, at a premium.
Erasmus was a Dutch philosopher widely recognized as one of the leading humanists of the Renaissance. Erasmus is also the name for the European Union's breathtakingly ambitious program to help millions of young people study outside their own country. America needs its own Erasmus.
Citing a goal of making health insurance less expensive, the administration has expanded access to potentially leaner health plans via association plans and short-term coverage -- and has invited states to request changes to their insurance marketplaces that would allow insurers to duck some coverage requirements. Democrats, deeply frustrated by the efforts, routinely accuse the administration of severely undermining the ACA and its consumer protections.
-- Joe Biden has told at least half a dozen supporters that he will run for president and asked for their help lining up major donors so he can raise $7 million quickly, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Ken Thomas report: Biden has expressed concern to these people that he wouldn't be able to raise millions of dollars in online donations immediately the way some other Democratic candidates have. World leaders have encouraged Biden to run, adds Politico's Daniel Lippman.
The problem with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is not that its ideas are too bold or too radical — it is that it is too wedded to specific, highly symbolic policy prescriptions, too apt to confuse compromise for capitulation, too ready to demonize those who disagree and turn off those who are undecided.

In other states, insurers have made requests for large rate increases. Others face the prospect of having zero option for consumers. In Iowa and Nebraska, a small midwestern insurer called Medica has been catapulted into the national spotlight as potentially the last insurer in both states' marketplaces, although that company has not announced a final decision about whether to participate in either state. In Missouri, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City announced in late May that it would leave 32 counties in Kansas and Missouri.
First, there are the mechanics of actually passing a repeal and a replacement. Our own Mike DeBonis and Kelsey Snell tackled this a couple days ago. Here's the crux:
In addition to health care and appointments, the Senate will also devote time to passing a defense authorization bill and other important issues, McConnell said. The Senate will now remain at work through the week of Aug. 7.
And a writer for the Daily Show received a reimbursement check from the Treasury:
But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place? As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare. I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.
The White House has yet to come out publicly in favor of expanded powers, but could once its review of the threat is finished.
The bill was passed hastily, with little debate and key revisions agreed upon during closed-door meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. At the time of the vote, the Congressional Budget Office had not analyzed the bill's cost and impact on coverage, but the agency's analysis of its original version that 24 million would lose insurance by 2026.
There he was, offering a mint to Klobuchar. Feinstein offered a care package to the 8-year-old. And senators from both parties praised Liam for his good behavior during the hours-long testimony on Capitol Hill.
As McConnell suggested to Kentucky Today, all of that is no small feat. What he did could reverberate across generations. Gorsuch could be a tie-breaking vote on whether to dramatically shrink unions' power. The court is also deciding whether political gerrymandering is unconstitutional, a decision that could impact a number of Republican-controlled states.

The two candidates are strikingly similar in their policy positions, so for Democratic primary voters, the deciding factors may be style and background.
The fatal conceit of Obamacare is that we're just going to make everybody buy our health insurance at the federal level, young and healthy people are going to go into the market and pay for older, sicker people. So the young healthy person's going to be made to buy health care, and they're going to pay for the person, you know, who gets breast cancer in her 40s, or who gets heart disease in his 50s … the whole idea of Obamacare is … the people who are healthy pay for the people who are sick. It's not working, and that's why it's in a death spiral.
HOT ON THE LEFT: To solve his immigration crisis, Trump turns to a table of white men, from Eugene Scott: Mark Knoller, a CBS White House correspondent, tweeted a photo Wednesday of President Trump's meeting with Vice President Pence, members of his Cabinet and lawmakers to discuss pending immigration bills and his executive order ending the separation of families of illegal immigrants at the border. The photo was notable for its demographic makeup. ... Those seeking solutions to the problem created by Trump's 'zero-tolerance' policy toward illegal immigrants appear to have little in common with those affected … This is partially because of the general lack of diversity within the administration. But that's not really an excuse for why there were so few people at the table who could identify closely with the immigrant experience. … If the president is truly interested in hearing the concerns of those his policies impact most, a start would be to, at the very least, include them in the conversation. Their absence speaks volumes and gives the impression that people most like Trump are the ones who matter most to him. HOT ON THE RIGHT: Good News for Republicans, It's Not 2006, from the Cook Political Report: For much of 2017 and early 2018, GOP consultants of a certain age would tell us that this election had the same look, feel and smell of 2006; the last time Republicans had a terrible midterm election.
But having the IRS stand up a new program starting in July to send payments for approximately 66 million American children could prove a challenge.
During an interview on Fox News, Mulvaney said a group of administration officials, including HHS SecretaryAzar and CMS administrator Seema Verma met at Camp David and discussed the issue. We spent the time this weekend saying, okay, what have we done, what can we talk about that's a success, what do we need to work on going forward?
If you're single and make more than $75,000, but less than $99,000, you'll get a smaller check, according to the IRS. The same goes for couples earning more than $150,000 but less than $198,000.

In November, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in the District of Columbia blocked the previous administration from immediately expelling children and teenagers who arrived at the southern border without their parents. A trio of Trump-appointed appeals court judges in the D.C. Circuit overturned him in January, but the ruling backed Biden into an uncomfortable corner.
A big part of Friday's proceedings are gonna be getting people there by the D.C. Metro system, which has been having breakdowns and a series of problems. Is anybody concerned about how that's gonna function Friday? And is the president-elect concerned about the -- I guess the infrastructure of that system when he takes over?
Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?
Such statements are designed in part to peel away working-class white voters who might otherwise choose Democrats.
I see no evidence they're taking any activist role in trying to make these markets work, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health.
The idea of drugs crossing U.S. borders could be construed as conflicting with the president-elect's support of trade barriers, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. But Cannon acknowledged that, overall, Trump's health-care machinations have been a black box for me.
It's also one that will almost certainly succeed in changing the subject from Russia and Mike Flynn.
-- Trump's proposal to overhaul the federal government would consolidate many safety-net programs. Lisa Rein reports: Other presidents have met mixed success in their attempts to streamline government functions, but Trump administration officials said they intend to shake up what one called a 'nonsensical' bureaucracy that requires multiple agencies — from the Food and Drug Administration to the Department of Agriculture — to regulate the production and distribution of a roast beef sandwich. … But the 132-page plan, which creates some offices and collapses others, is silent on a critical question for federal workers and the unions representing them: How many jobs would be lost under the White House proposals? . . . Many key recommendations . . . would require approval from Congress, where Democrats immediately assailed them as dead on arrival. … The proposal's centerpieces and most controversial elements are the Labor and Education merger into a new Department of Education and the Workforce and a reconstituted Department of Health and Human Services, which would be renamed the Department of Health and Public Welfare.
There was a similar reaction yesterday, as Democrats portrayed the move as more evidence the administration is trying to undermine the Affordable Care Act and constrict Medicaid.
— The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is launching a seven-figure ad campaign to push back against the Trump administration's proposal to peg what Medicare pays for drugs to what foreign countries pay.
Is there anything that will definitely happen in 2019? he writes. In 2018, the drug industry spent a potentially record sum lobbying Congress. There is a 100 percent guarantee they will surpass that milestone this year.
7. Are there Republicans who might vote with Democrats?
Some of the Medicare savings — possibly between $250 billion and $300 billion, according to one estimate — would be redirected to other health programs, but most would be slashed from the budget.
Instead of just discussing what it opposes, the industry is also trying to highlight a policy change it does support — requiring insurers to pass along rebates directly to seniors.

Barr said Tuesday he would not carry out an order from the president to fire the special counsel, unless there was good cause to do so.
We have about seven nominations in. I believe we put seven very, very highly qualified people for the IG position, Trump said Tuesday, acknowledging that he could've made the moves three years ago but decided to do so in the middle of a pandemic.
On Thursday, the two men will meet in Washington, striving for party unity after Ryan refused to endorse Trump's presidential bid. When he arrives, Trump will have nearly clinched the GOP nomination by running squarely against Ryan's vision of what Republicanism is.
Buttigieg also wants to make private marketplace plans more affordable. He has proposed providing more generous federal subsidies by pegging them to the cost of more generous gold plans instead of less-generous silver plans under the Affordable Care Act. He would also cap premiums at 8.5 percent of income, regardless of how much an enrollee earns.
It appears to be a major concern in Texas, where one in three emergency room visits leads to a surprise medical bill, the Texas Association of Health Plans says, which is twice the national average, Jay and Shannon write. And requests for help have spiked through the mediation program created in 2009.
Allow tremendous numbers of legal immigrants based on a merit system, selecting immigrants who will help grow the country's economy. (The number of legal immigrants has been sharply reduced, although Trump at other points promised to decrease them.)
The fewest undecideds are in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada….These are states where both parties have their bases, with voters split heavily along racial, religious and educational lines….Maine, Michigan, Colorado, Iowa, and New Hampshire have more undecided voters than the others….they have something in common: a lot of white voters, and particularly a lot of middle-class whites, which is one group that's still relatively torn between the candidates.
No matter where people fall in the debate, virtually everyone cares deeply about the outcome. The Journal-Constitution survey, conducted the week before last, found that 81 percent of likely voters describe health care as an extremely or very important priority to them, larger than any other issue by far.
Fauci said Tuesday that the new plan is different in its geographic concentration and because of significant research developments from the past few years. Recent studies have shown that people at greater risk of infection — such as men who have sex with men — can lower their likelihood of contracting the virus markedly if they take daily pre-exposure HIV medicines known as PrEP. Other studies have documented that HIV-infected people whose viral load is reduced through medicine to undetectable levels have little risk of transmitting the infection.
— Mueller subpoenas Bannon. The Post's Karoun Demirjian, Carol D. Leonnig and Roz Helderman: Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's office has subpoenaed former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon to appear before a grand jury, a move that indicates his broad investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign is far from wrapping up. The subpoena was issued last week, according to a person familiar with the situation, who said that Bannon expects to be able to persuade the special counsel's office to accept a voluntary interview of Bannon by prosecutors in place of a grand jury appearance. The news of Mueller's action, which was first reported by the New York Times, came on the same day that the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Bannon for refusing to answer a range of questions from investigators during a combative closed-door interview, frustrating members of both parties who are probing the Trump campaign's alleged Russia ties.
The Harris staff says the language in the tweet referred to the possibility that people would be effectively denied coverage because they could not afford it. This line of reasoning was based on the notion that the House GOP bill, as drafted, could lead to a death spiral because of the continuous-coverage provision, with the stabilization funds unable to help people cover their costs during the one-year period when they are not in the community-rated premium pool. But the CBO report said that the AHCA, as originally structured, could attract a sufficient number of relatively healthy people to stabilize the market. (CBO also said, contrary to GOP claims, that the Obamacare markets were also stable.) There has not been a CBO report yet on the final bill. (Further update: see our fact check on the CBO report, which does conclude that in some states, with about one-sixth of the U.S. population, the law's efforts to protect people with preexisting medical conditions might end up undermining the individual insurance markets so much that effectively there is no protection at all. )
But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.
Third, conservatives dislike how the law distributes benefits. When used with the traditional Medicaid program, the ACA insures low-income adults. It's true that nearly eight in 10 Medicaid adults live in working families, and 60 percent work themselves. But millions of working-age people on Medicaid are not currently employed, often because of disability, illness or care-giving responsibilities. Some conservatives want more Medicaid recipients to work. And so they want to make it harder for people to qualify for benefits.
Tuesday's near party-line vote to override Obama's January veto of legislation gutting much of the law was 241-186, but that fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to reverse a veto. House Speaker Paul Ryan said the effort to force enactment of the bill, which would have also ended federal payments to Planned Parenthood, would send an important signal.
Bloomberg contended that, after reviewing the surveillance program, the courts ruled it was exactly within the law. Campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood pointed to a 2014 ruling by a federal judge in New Jersey who had dismissed one of the lawsuits. An appeals court reversed that ruling the next year, writing of the surveillance program: We have been down similar roads before. Jewish-Americans during the Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, and Japanese-Americans during World War II are examples that readily spring to mind. In the end, the lawsuit, Hassan v. City of New York, was among the three settlements.
The political blame game is likely to continue and intensify in coming weeks as insurers announce more decisions, either to curtail or withdraw from markets or to seek big rate increases.
Under Obama, many of these leaders felt that their religious freedoms were under attack, feeling pressure primarily from the left. Now, Keller said, many of them feel under attack from those on the right if they support a more open immigration policy or foreign policy.
The remainder of Why We're Polarized catalogues the many other institutional sources of the underlying divide. The media, and especially social media, thrives on virality; it no longer reports news but creates news based on what sells. Changes in our campaign finance laws have weakened the political parties; this plus the spread of popular primaries has opened both parties to more extreme positions, since activists on left and right are the ones who donate money and vote in primaries. The fact that the United States has a presidential system and winner-take-all elections raises the stakes in contests and promotes extremist behavior, like Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's sidelining of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland during the final year of Obama's presidency. Finally, local politics, which used to be resistant to larger national trends, have also become polarized because of outside money and national media.
Are you concerned about the way Donald Trump undermines the institutions in our society? Hirono asked.
The talking heads are already declaring the death of the Iowa caucuses, which strikes me as a pity. Yes, there are problems with caucuses, from the lack of a secret ballot to the inability to participate if you're housebound. On the other hand, caucuses let us peek at the second choices of voters whose first choice can't command a majority, and that's valuable information as voters try to coordinate around a candidate they can all support.
Alexander, speaking at the Atlantic event:
Key excerpt: Trump believed that firing Comey would make him a hero. Over the next 48 hours he spun his side to various friends. It was simple: He had stood up to the FBI. He proved that he was willing to take on the state power. The outsider against the insiders. After all, that's why he was elected.
In 2012, though, in a case brought by ACA critics who unsuccessfully challenged the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court ruled that each state had the latitude to choose whether to expand Medicaid. Nearly all ­Democratic-led states said yes; most with Republican governors opted out.
Defund Planned Parenthood and reallocate its funding to community health centers. (Planned Parenthood is still funded, although the administration has moved to strip some of its funding. Trump also promised to fully block taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood as part of his reelection campaign — reflecting the lack of fulfillment on the promise.)
Cut the top individual tax rate from 39.6 to 33 percent. The plan would also streamline the number of tax brackets from seven to three — 12, 15 and 33 percent.
Trump is a 'subject' of Special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Here's what that means:
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades, Trump said. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.
--Trump will undergo a physical exam next week, in his first publicly known medical checkup by a government doctor since becoming president. He'll be examined Jan. 12 by Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, the physician to the president, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, per Bloomberg. After the examination, Jackson will issue a public statement about Trump's health.
Asked for specific policies that she opposed, Alvarado identified the tax bill's heavy cuts for corporations.
— Two of the seven drug company summoned by Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to testify before Congress have agreed to send representatives to appear before the panel, the committee said yesterday.
A family spokesman called the allegations a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. We strongly deny these allegations, which are inconsistent with the factual record, and will vigorously defend against them.
As political junkies drummed their fingers and stared at screens, conspiracy theories began to fly about the app that the local precincts were using to report results. Or rather, the app they were supposed to use, because it apparently didn't actually work.
A CBS News poll last month asked the question with almost the same language, and only 38 percent favored the wall: 78 percent of Republicans but just 13 percent of Democrats.
KELLY: All right. I'm going to let Mr. Trump -- I'm going to let -- let me just...
BAIER: Senator Cruz, the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, a decision you have criticized. Given the current status of the law, do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt?
TRUMP: And I will tell you this. First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million. Believe me, I started off with $1 million. I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion. And I say it not in a bragging way, but that's the kind of thinking we need.
Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.
In reality, our current economic boom is a Keynesian mirage. The only reason our economy is growing at all is that because of extravagant tax cuts and undisciplined spending, the federal government last year spent $1 trillion more than it brought in in revenue, even as the Federal Reserve injects an additional $60 billion a month into the financial system. As the International Monetary Fund warned in its annual economic outlook last fall, such a level of fiscal and monetary stimulus is not sustainable, creating risks of inflation, a spike in interest rates or a sharp decline in the value of the dollar, any of which in turn could lead to a recession or financial crisis. In the longer run, this addiction to living beyond our means will also have the effect of making us ever more beholden to the foreign lenders and investors who make it possible.
Rubio and Wagner's bill would allow parents of a newborn biological or adopted child to pull forward one month, two months or three months of their Social Security benefits in order to finance their time off of work. A summary of the bill provided to Health 202 says nearly all parents earning less than the $60,000 median family income would receive leave pay equal to about two-thirds of their wages.
The next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with Federalist Society members: Twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges Trump has appointed are or were members of the society. Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, McGahn quipped to a Federalist Society gathering in 2017. That is completely false. I've been a member of the Federalist Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.
Last week's administrative order was issued following an opportunity for the two states to review and comment on a draft of the revised payment methodology, said a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson. CMS believes that the administrative order—and the forthcoming payments to the states—should fully address the concerns raised by the states in the litigation.
The bold and decisive actions this President has taken throughout this pandemic are purely about protecting the public health, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, adding, whether it be providing food to children impacted by school closures, closing our border to certain countries and regions where the virus is spreading, or pausing all interest on student loans, this President wants us to put politics aside and come together to make sure we emerge from this crisis healthy, safe, and strong.
The Trump administration's disjointed handling of the outbreak has faced mounting criticism as the president's allies have scrambled to take preventive steps while seeking to reassure the public, at times struggling to explain their decisions and offer a consistent message, Toluse Olorunnipa and Costa report. For a president who has governed 'by tweet and circus,' a potential global health crisis that blunts economic growth could expose one of Trump's main weaknesses as he prepares to face voters in November, said Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.
Charles existed so apart from his quadriplegic disability in the minds and experiences of those of us who knew him … that any anger I might have felt at the imposition of his writerly arrogance seemed entirely permissible [until] the moment that I remembered, … that any anger I might have felt at the imposition of his writerly arrogance seemed entirely permissible [until] the moment that I remembered, John Podhoretz writes . I would remember he could not put pen to paper. I would remember he wrote by dictating. I would remember it was a goddamned astonishing fact of facts that he could do any of this, let alone do it with such easy brilliance. Think of it. He read widely and paid attention to everything — a man who had some difficulty turning a page. He wrote weekly, this man who could not write. … It is a key role of the intellectual explicator, which is what Charles was nonpareil — to help you understand what you think. … [And] I can say I'm not sure anyone in my lifetime has ever done that better.
House Republicans came out of a highly anticipated meeting on health care Thursday morning with some new details on the options GOP leaders are considering to replace the Affordable Care Act, but not with the fully formed plan that those leaders and President Trump have promised.
Thus The Fact Checker was surprised to come across a three-page report issued by the CEA in March, just as lawmakers were deciding whether to add money to the omnibus spending bill to temporarily restore cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. The report prompted a news story in The Wall Street Journal — Insurers Doing Well, White House Says, Raising ACA Subsidy Doubts — and apparently played a role in lawmakers deciding not to add the money for CSRs to the bill.
Last night, in federal court, the Justice Department of the Trump Administration – you'd think they have more to do – decided to not only try to destroy protections for preexisting conditions, but to tear down every last benefit and protection the ACA affords. The GOP will never stop trying to destroy the affordable health care of America's families. I always think of Mr. Clyburn and John Lewis when they quote Martin Luther King, when he talks about, 'of all the injustices, the most inhumane is the inequality of health care.'
Hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would result in 1.4 million unemployed but would lift 900,000 out of poverty, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new report.
3. It ended subsidies to help insure lower-income people: About 7 million lower-income people get health insurance via the ACA exchanges. And the ACA helped them afford deductibles by subsidizing their cost to insurance companies. Trump ended these payments in October, a blow to Obamacare that could have sunk the whole thing, said Paul Ginsburg, a health policy expert with the University of Southern California's Brookings Schaeffer Initiative.
House Republicans celebrated with the White House Thursday after narrowly passing the controversial repeal-and-replace bill.
Yet the changes aren't permanent — and fall far short of what Democrats say they'd like to accomplish on expanding health coverage.
But no mention was made of addressing gun violence, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports, except for his administration's ban on bump stocks. Instead, at the end of the statement, the president said he and first lady Melania Trump join all Americans in praying for the continued healing of those in the Parkland community and all communities where lives have been lost to gun violence.
The comments aren't always mean. Watch Washington Post opinion columnist Charles Krauthammer responds to the rare positive comment from a reader. (Whitney Leaming, Dani Player, Malcolm Cook/The Washington Post)
We have our colleagues on the other sides of the aisle and the president who have come out with some form of paid leave, DeLauro said at the news conference reintroducing the Democrats' bill. That's good and it's part of the national debate and this issue is at the center of our public discourse. … But I will just say to you their proposals fail to go far enough.
Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.
A Republican-controlled Congress passed a tax bill in December that also essentially ended the individual mandate, a central tenet of the ACA. That means that starting next year, people don't have to choose between paying for insurance or paying a fine for going uninsured. They won't be punished in their taxes for being uninsured.
A powerful 6.4-magnitude earthquake off Puerto Rico's southwestern coast early Jan. 7 triggered a widespread blackout on the island and damaged homes. (The Washington Post)
The House has to pass a bill, said Cassidy, who has written a replacement bill that retains much of the Affordable Care Act. It'll go to conference committee. I'm sure the administration will be involved. There will be two other times when what the White House is advocating can be addressed.
But many of the comments to his post were in response to his earlier statement.
That's as far as she has taken it, though, explaining that it's hard for people in rural areas to attend rallies because that often requires traveling great distances.
In interviews after his ouster, Shulkin repeatedly blamed his removal on administration officials and their allies, who he said were trying to privatize VA's health-care system.
Donald Trump was not elected to defund Planned Parenthood, she said.
Others might be able to continue the insurance plan from the jobs they lost, with COBRA coverage. But COBRA can be very costly: Enrollees must pay 102 percent of the full cost of coverage, including the employer's share, and COBRA is difficult to navigate and doesn't apply to very small employers. The average cost of family coverage for families last year was $20,576, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which means that the average cost of a COBRA plan would be about $1,750 a month.
CRUZ: So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. And if you want to actually see the postcard, see all the details, you can find them on our Web site. It's tedcruz.org.
I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago. We have been working on our tax returns. I've said they'll be out. ... And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out 12 years in a row.
The Protect Life Rule is a victory pro-life Americans have been awaiting for three decades. President Ronald Reagan first issued a version of the rule in 1988, but pro-abortion groups challenged it in court. The George H.W. Bush administration fought them all the way to the Supreme Court and won: In 1991, the court upheld the Reagan rule in Rust v. Sullivan. But the ruling came too late; Bill Clinton soon took office and withdrew the rule.
It will be the Supreme Court's third consideration of the legal merits of the Affordable Care Act. And while the court has become more conservative with the addition of Trump's two nominees, the majority of five justices who have sided with the ACA in the past remains intact.
Despite these shifts, moderates are likely to be turned off by how the bill cuts Medicaid more deeply than the House version. But the biggest cuts wouldn't take effect for seven years, a time frame that could be more politically palatable for members like Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).

We support preexisting conditions, we have been very clear on that, and that's — a lot of our conversation was about that, McCarthy said.
Right now, there are three camps among Democrats when it comes to the filibuster, though things seem to be moving quickly and senators are shifting their views by the day.
Many of the president's policy ideas preceded this crisis, and it's appropriate for him to enact laws, said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush. It is a part of the president's mission to keep America moving forward on all fronts.
In a recent email, Blahous said he has not calculated the overall payment cut that providers would receive from Sanders's plan. Matt Bruenig, the founder of a socialist think-tank the People's Policy Project, puts that number at 11 percent. The Urban Institute, a centrist think-tank, found the number is closer to 13 percent.
But Republican leaders, eager to show voters they're responding to the problem, are arguing their inexpensive, somewhat piecemeal approach will still have ripple effects . They argue – and many experts agree – this batch of legislation at least goes further than a 2016 bill making some small policy changes and provided $1 billion to fight opioid addiction.
Key excerpt: In early August [2016], less than a month after Ailes had been ousted from Fox News, Trump asked his old friend to take over the management of his calamitous campaign. Ailes, knowing Trump's disinclination to take advice, or even listen to it, turned him down.
That's what the people at Justice do every day of the week, is influence proceedings — that's what they're there for, Barr said. He raised the example of former attorney general Eric Holder making controversial pardon recommendations — noting that he had actually supported Holder for the job.
Since its formation seven years ago, the group has racked up major legislative victories and poured at least $52 million into campaigns and policy work, according to tax filings.
Hasan Minhaj broke down some of the failures behind the U.S.'s student loans system:
When Joe Biden assumes office, job No. 1 will be to get the coronavirus crisis under control. Job No. 2 will be returning the economy to full employment and basic health — and more stimulus will invariably be needed to bring the economy back.
See how President Trump's stalled GOP agenda is casting a shadow over the special election in Georgia:
A 2013 change in federal health privacy law made it easier for hospitals to target their patients for donations, Phil writes. It enabled hospital records departments to share with staff fundraisers some personal details of patients, including their health insurance status, the department treating them, the name of their physician and the outcome of their care.
But we'll end with one way they're alike: Trump earned the ire of editorial boards for banning media outlets (including The Washington Post). Pence, a former talk radio host, also got into it with the media when he floated the idea of a state-run news agency. (Pence backed away from the idea soon after the Indianapolis Star reported it.)
The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.
Annie Shoup, communications director for the Democrat-aligned group Protect Our Care:
-- A beautiful day of 70-degree weather – but get outside while you can, because it's not here to stay. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Dense fog this morning means less than quarter mile visibility at times especially early in the morning commute. A warm front brings back the balmy air mass that was in place Saturday. That means temperatures return to the 70s in the afternoon — although the morning may remain cool and clammy, at least early on. Skies are mostly cloudy and we can't rule out a stray shower or thundershower, but most of us should stay dry.
And Trump, who called for paid family leave in his State of the Union address last year, again signaled in his address to Congress last week that he views the effort as a top priority. I am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child, Trump said.
We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity, she said. Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what's going on.
The HIV/AIDS pledge was part of a smorgasbord of health policy issues that Trump wove briefly into a speech portrayed by the White House as an attempt to find ideological common ground amid a moment of bitter partisanship that led to the longest government shutdown in history — and a reopening only guaranteed to last until mid-month.
Whatever Trump thought he'd deliver may prove elusive because the problems of working-class Rust Belt voters are the result not of foreigners stealing their jobs or dumb trade deals, but long-term, knotty problems that have no easy solution. Trump certainly has no idea how to make the transition to a 21st-century economy while making sure millions don't get left behind. He never even talks about juicing productivity, let alone puts forth a plan to do so.
Then, on Friday, a more familiar standoff vexed Ryan. House conservatives threatened to vote against a must-pass farm bill (which does a lot in addition to providing subsidies to farmers) if Republican leaders didn't bow to their demands on immigration.
We need to prepare for border surges now, Timothy Perry, ICE's new chief of staff, wrote in a Feb. 12 email. We need to begin making changes immediately.
TRUMP: ... This is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right. Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an A from the Better Business Bureau...
But the bottom didn't fall out until Romney cast the historic vote against Trump on impeachment. As with many of these previous examples, that's when Trump truly trained his fire on his fellow Republican. In this and these other cases, Trump did so as a means of enforcing a code of behavior inside the GOP and discouraging future apostasies. He has even gone so far as to repeatedly criticize McCain even after his death.
A legal reporter for Bloomberg Law:
From The Guardian's Moscow correspondent, who was detained in the protests:
Most Kentuckians want a fair trial, she said.
I am writing to share with you that, as a result of my column, Prof. Fair has directed hateful, vulgar and disrespectful messages to me, including the allegations that I am: a 'fraud'; 'fame-mongering clown show'; and a 'bevkuf,' or 'idiot,' in my native Urdu, who has 'pimped herself out,'  Nomani wrote in a Dec. 2 email included in the complaint to Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown's Center for Security Studies. This last allegation amounts to 'slut-shaming.' 
Are you open to reconsidering the position? Harris asked.
TRUMP: ... I can give it to you. I can give it to you tomorrow..
BAIER: Mr. Trump, you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban. So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment?
Ambulance providers may see some relief from a provision that allows Medicare to reimburse providers for services even if the patient is not transported to a hospital. Current rules only allow ambulances to be reimbursed if they take a patient to the closest hospital or clinic, but during the pandemic, some jurisdictions have instructed ambulances to deliver care in place whenever possible. Current rules only allow ambulances to be reimbursed if they take a patient to the closest hospital or clinic, but during the pandemic, some jurisdictions have instructed ambulances to deliver care in place whenever possible.
We know many of those children are eligible, she said, so we want to find out and work with counties to do whatever additional outreach or system changes can get more kids covered.
It was the nation's highest daily death toll from the coronavirus, and double the number of deaths reported three days ago. The figures come from Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracking dashboard, which also says more than 361,000 people in the U.S. have died since the pandemic began.

Paid family leave, which Democrats have long sought, has gained bipartisan traction in recent months, with Trump becoming the first Republican president to call for such a measure in his State of the Union address in February. His daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump has pushed hard for the policy, and the Republican-led Senate in December agreed to fund 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for federal employees, which Trump signed into law.
Seth Meyers criticized Rep. Steve King's (R-Iowa) use of a problematic meme:
And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now — it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running.
Though the emotional pitch has subsided amid the pandemic, it's sure to heat up again soon. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has ordered all Pennsylvanians to stay at home through the end of the month and moved the state primary from April 28 to June 2.
OOF: A group of 20 states and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) separately announced lawsuits to stop the Trump administration's rule that could shift tens of millions of dollars away from organizations such as Planned Parenthood and toward faith-based and antiabortion clinics.
Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.
There are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life, Romney says, after Trump hands it off to him. This is one of them. He goes on to say that being in Trump's hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight.
-- A bipartisan group of 58 former senior national security officials signed a statement saying there is no basis for Trump declaring a national emergency to build his wall on the southern border. The 11-page document is mainly intended to support lawsuits challenging the president's proclamation, Ellen Nakashima reports: The joint statement, whose signatories include former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, will come a day before the House is expected to vote on a resolution to block Trump's Feb. 15 declaration. ... Also signing were Eliot A. Cohen, State Department counselor under President George W. Bush; Thomas R. Pickering, President George H.W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations; John F. Kerry, Obama's second secretary of state; Susan E. Rice, Obama's national security adviser; Leon E. Panetta, Obama's CIA director and defense secretary; as well as former intelligence and security officials who served under Republican and Democratic administrations.
-- Hypocrisy alert: A growing number of Democrats are abandoning their previously strict position that alleged victims of sexual misconduct must be believed now that they face the possibility of losing the Virginia governor's mansion to the Republican state House speaker. From Paul Kane: 'This was 15 years ago and it's mighty suspect that it would come out now,' said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus. … Some are urging a consistency of the cause regardless if it cuts short the career of a rising star such as Fairfax. Others are staking out different ground as the Virginia scandals pile up, acknowledging that one top priority is to retain control of the governor's mansion. And many Democrats, even those who took the lead against Kavanaugh's nomination four months ago, just want to avoid the issue altogether. … Even [Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.)], less than 24 hours after tweeting that she believed Fairfax committed sexual assault, declined to say what should happen to the lieutenant governor. 'I'm taking my elevator back to my office,' she said Thursday afternoon, declining to comment.
The effort is expected to follow a path similar to the one Republicans blazed in 2015 with the repeal measure ending in an Obama veto, according to several GOP leadership aides. Conservatives openly touted that bill as a dress rehearsal for the future.
Healey accuses the family of disregarding addiction and safety in the name of profit, saying that members of the family directed sales representatives to push high doses of the drug while knowing its potential dangers. The family instead says that it acted in a routine way for members of a corporate board: reviewing voluminous documents, including budget presentations, spreadsheets and reports about Purdue's nationwide operations.
That Giuliani would have a direct pipeline to the Justice Department for providing information on a political rival of Trump raised fears among some legal analysts that federal law enforcement was being conscripted into doing campaign work for the president. The matter is complicated, too, because Giuliani is under investigation by the Justice Department. That case already has produced campaign finance charges against two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped in Giuliani's Ukraine-related pursuits … Barr said the intake process was established 'so that any information coming in about Ukraine could be carefully scrutinized by the department and its intelligence community partners so that we could assess its provenance and its credibility.' FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said: 'We're taking information as we would in any case. We will evaluate it appropriately.' … Barr's announcement angered Democrats, who questioned whether Giuliani was getting special treatment from Trump's Justice Department. … Giuliani has long vexed Barr and the Justice Department. … But Giuliani has maintained access to the department and to Barr.
— Republican lawmakers are itching for hearings on Democrats' Medicare-for-all proposals, hoping such public airings will give them a chance to home in on an opposing message leading up to 2020 elections, Politico's Alice Miranda Ollstein reports.
What we also see quite often with Trump is talk that he's going to do something that he doesn't ultimately follow through on, Heye said. But the base still gives him credit for starting that conversation.
ABRAMS 2020?: Stacey Abrams said Monday that a 2020 presidential run is 'definitely on the table,' clarifying earlier remarks that seemed to rule one out, NBC News's Alex Seitz Wald reports:
When Lowey pressed him on whether women should be able to access contraception without having to pay an insurance co-pay — another ACA mandate — Price made the same point.
As coronavirus hospitalizations surged in January, Los Angeles County ordered ambulance crews not to take patients who can't be resuscitated after cardiac arrest to hospitals. In New Rochelle, N.Y., ambulance services were told to treat patients in place whenever possible.
What we are trying to do is to keep the review process continuing because of important drugs in the pipeline, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Laurie in an interview. Such drug reviews are funded by fees paid by the pharmaceutical companies, which the agency can't collect during the shutdown. The fees from 2018 are set to run out around Feb. 8.
The ban, which is set to take effect on Feb. 6., will ban sales of most flavored e-cigarette products but does not bar the sales of menthol or tobacco-flavored pods. Critics have argued young people will just switch products.
But any analysis of how these votes will play in elections assumes that advertising and campaign rhetoric match up to reality. There's no guarantee of that; the first two attack ads launched at Democrats over the Green New Deal focused on two Democrats who did not, in fact, co-sponsor it.
It gives the prosecutor more tools. The more charges you can put on a defendant, the stronger your case is, the Texas lawmaker said.
So tax reform can hardly be called a sure thing.
Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) promised when McCain died that he would deliver a whipping to anybody — including Trump — who impugned McCain's good name moving forward. And now he's made good on that promise.
He is a horrible speaker! said Tracy Alvarado, 43, a stay-at-home mother who I met further up the street. The language that he uses is repulsive and very offensive. Standing next to her was her daughter Lily, 17, who looked as though she'd heard this line of complaint before.
We are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. (The Trump tax cut was nearly 0.9 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 2.89 percent of GDP for President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut. Data show it's only the eighth-largest on record.)
Her campaign's bet was that she could drive Democratic base turnout without sacrificing too much support among working-class whites in the upper Midwest. Something closer to the reverse happened on Election Day.
Three women on the U.S. mainland have given birth to infants with birth defects related to the Zika virus. The CDC is currently monitoring 234 women on the U.S. mainland and another 189 with Zika in Puerto Rico
When Cruz held up government funding in 2013 over his demand that Obamacare be defunded, Colorado was still reeling from floods that had ravaged the state. When the government shut down, the emergency funds from the federal government were paused.
A former cheerleader and recent graduate, 19-year-old Sydney Aiello, took her life on March 17 after struggling with survivor's guilt and post-traumatic stress disorder, her mother said, our Post colleagues Lori Rozsa, Kayla Epstein and Katie Mettler report. Six days later, a sophomore who authorities have not identified died by apparent suicide.

-- Anita Hill told an Iowa crowd last night that it's too late for Biden to apologize for the way he mistreated and diminished her when she testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991. The statute of limitations for his apology is up, Hill said in response to a question from the audience at the University of Iowa, where she gave a lecture on ending sexual harassment. What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do today? Will you promise as leader of this country … to use all of your energy to address the problem as it happened and to prevent it from happening to another generation? That's what I want to hear. And I not only want to hear from him, I want to hear from every one of them who want to be the leader of this country. (BuzzFeed News)
Shandor used to work in an emergency room and complained that undocumented immigrants from Mexico would always get medical care with no questions asked. She said she resents freeloaders and explained that she supports the House bill because her understanding is that it will make Mexicans pay more for their health care. I didn't have a child because I didn't know if I could afford it, the 58-year-old said as she took a break from tending to her vegetable garden. But Mexican kids in the country illegally are automatically covered. Hopefully that changes.
TRUMP: Sadly, the American Dream is dead.
There will be people arguing that Trump isn't the problem at all, but that the GOP establishment didn't do enough to help him….There will also be Trump supporters who will argue that massive, systemic, voter fraud was to blame for Trump's defeat, and they'll want tougher voter ID laws, which will cut against establishment Republican efforts at minority outreach.
While Trump has repeatedly said he wants to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, McConnell said he has yet to see a clear proposal from the White House about how that will happen.
As he spoke in an interview after the town hall, an argument broke out a few feet away, underscoring the raw tensions at the meeting.
In hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. I ran into Josh Blackman, the Texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. All the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. At dinner last night I met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things I want to write about. As long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.
Biden is considering whether to ask for Secret Service protection.
Azar noted that a goal for the Trump administration is to bring down list prices altogether. Drug companies defend themselves by pointing out that these annual increases are on the 'list price' of drugs, he writes in a Stat op-ed. List prices are typically reduced by additional payments to middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers … But Americans know better, because increases in list prices hit their pocketbooks.
What Democrats propose is the sort of step-by-step expansion of Obamacare that both Republicans and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) vehemently oppose. Republicans want nothing; Sanders wants to scrap everything in favor of single-payer health care.
State GOP Senate leaders had kept it tied up in committee, but they had promised a debate this year. Republicans got some concessions — among them a program to refer recipients to jobs programs — and now there's a deal, which means the expansion is all but certain to happen.
--Five Republican senators are being pressured by a $1.5 million ad campaign from a consumer health organization not to vote for the emerging health-care legislation, my colleague Sean Sullivan reports. Community Catalyst Action Fund, which bills itself as a consumer health organization, is targeting Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine), Dean Heller (Nev.) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) with television and radio ads urging them to vote no, Sean writes.

For many corporate executives, Washington has simply become an unproductive distraction.
That's fair, since fiascos like his just appear
The inequity, however, is not simply with the distributional impact of repealing these taxes to reduce health insurance subsidies. There is also an aspect of tax fairness.
China is a big market for American products like soybeans, he said. I would recommend that you read a story in today's New York Times. I know it's a competitor, but you should read the story about who's actually paying the tariffs. It's virtually 100 percent the American consumer, not the Chinese.
But the administration is taking steps that could delay premium spikes on Medicare prescription drug beneficiaries until after President Trump's 2020 reelection bid, Chris reports. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said it would take a year or more to take rebates out of the Medicare system, providing companies time to figure out logistics.
Tivity Health sponsors an event on Aging in Rural America: The Growing Crisis, a Movement for Change with remarks from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
The cable networks generally are reluctant to talk about their approach to chyron creation. CNN declined to comment, and Fox News didn't respond directly. A spokesperson for MSNBC allowed, During live broadcasts, chyrons are selected and aired by the show team in real time. She said the process is under the guidance of the executive producer and director, and at times includes broader input from standards and senior managers.
The 2017 tax cut — 34%
First, unlike Social Security and Medicare, Obamacare does not have a well-defined population of beneficiaries. The ACA is not a single program but, rather, a series of programs, subsidies and regulations. It treats people differently depending upon where they live, where they work, how they get insurance and how much they earn. That complicates efforts to mobilize public support.
The conservative group Heritage Action for America released opposition ads urging moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Mark Kelly (Ariz.) to vote no on Becerra's nomination.
I think we're going to have to really look at it closely. I couldn't commit to supporting it right now, said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), one such lawmaker.
My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
Biden was asked if he would support deporting immigrants whose only crime was crossing the border without authorization.
And while I plot my coup — here's what I've got for you,
Be a true friend to Israel. Trump says the United States will be working with Israel very closely, very, very closely. (Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Trump was the greatest friend Israel had.)

-- Polling shows why it's a sensible position to stake out in a Democratic primary. A Pew Research Center poll last year found a 55 percent majority support picking presidents by popular vote, compared to 41 percent who prefer keeping the electoral college. A solid 75 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support amending the Constitution so the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide wins, compared with 32 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. A majority of Republicans prefer the electoral college regardless of whether they live in a red state, a blue state or a battleground. And a majority of Democrats prefer the popular vote regardless of where they live, as well. Our in-house polling analyst Emily Guskin synthesized the results in an email: Partisans are likely to prefer ways they think their parties could win!
What exactly is in the 1,159-page compromise legislation allocating $324 billion in government spending - and what's not? (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he's trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money. TRUMP: Let me tell you the real con artist. Excuse me. Excuse me. The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.
The amount of money they are talking about is far short of what is needed, but the GOP package itself has some merit. It would, for instance, do a better job of targeting stimulus checks to those who need them the most — individuals earning $50,000 or less and couples making no more than $100,000. Biden's proposal would send government payments to some families making $300,000 or more.
KELLY: And there are many other examples. So how is any of this telling it like it is?
That doesn't mean we learn nothing about the candidates from their campaigns. To the contrary, we often know the direction in which they want to head. There was little doubt Obama was going to shoot for some quasi-universal health-care plan, that Bush was going to cut taxes and that Trump was going to go after immigrants and dole out tariffs. We knew these things not only because they said them during the campaign, but because these goals were consistent with their past pronouncements and with their current philosophies (to the extent they had one).
OUCH: The Texas Department of Insurance is experiencing a serious backlog of requests from patients seeking the state's help in dealing with surprise medical bills.
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 69 percent of the public is in favor of expanding marketplace subsidies, while nearly three-quarters of respondents, including half of Republicans, support providing financial incentives to states to expand Medicaid.
For years, O'Rourke has argued that there is already too much fencing and walling along the southern border, and he sharply criticized Trump and the wall during an interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday. 'I think he knows what he is doing,' O'Rourke said. 'I think there has been shown over many years great political reward for those who exploit this by stoking fear and anxiety, by lying to people about immigrants and the nature of the border and the safety and security that we have here.' O'Rourke continued: 'Some people have used code words, some have come at it obliquely. He just full on, in the most racist terms, completely divorced from the truth or facts or reality or our experience here in El Paso, uses this to incite fear and paranoia and turn that to political gain.'
Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.
Republicans and Trump have said they'd like to keep these latter two legs of the stool, but it's not clear how they'll implement such requirements in ways that are solvent. And even if they can keep those things, you still have the prospect of millions of Americans losing a health-care option they've had for years. There may be plenty of Obamacare recipients who aren't enamored of their fast-rising premiums, sure, but for many it's a health-care option that didn't exist before and could be taken away with an indeterminate replacement.
Bennet: I believe we need to a build broad coalition of Americans.
Democrats have amended the bill to address this issue and possibly speed the payout. The CBO offered its own caveat to the estimate: CBO's estimates of the rate at which federal agencies, states, local education agencies and other entities would spend those new funds are subject to considerable uncertainty, as is the question of whether those entities could spend the new funds within the allotted time.
We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio. Our wages grow faster than the national average. We're up over 400,000 jobs. We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt. It's a formula that works. And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.
THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
Our nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory, he said on the Senate floor Wednesday.
--A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
OUCH: The Drug Enforcement Administration has cut off opioid sales by a wholesaler for the first time in six years, The Post's Lenny Bernstein and Sari Horwitz report. The agency announced Friday it had immediately suspended opioid sales by Shreveport, La.-based Morris & Dickson, accusing the company of failing to properly identify large suspicious orders for controlled substances sold to independent pharmacies, in some cases sending out six times a drugstore's normal order without notifying federal drug officials as required by law.
— Earlier in the day, Democrats seized on the president's tweets on Monday punting the issue of health care until after the presidential election.
I think that's a disgrace, plus there are other things, Trump said. I was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed right to try.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D), who is challenging Heidi Heitkamp for Senate, said there is nothing inhumane about keeping children inside chain-link fences. By the way, chain-link fences are around playgrounds all over America, Cramer said on a North Dakota radio show. He later added on another radio program, Well, chain-link fences have been used to protect children from predators on playgrounds (and) baseball diamonds. (HuffPost)
So easing health-care costs has become a top Democratic promise, one the candidates will continue to focus on in 2020. During debates and on the campaign trail, they've rarely brought up the ACA, instead preferring to discuss ways of expanding affordable coverage either via Medicare-for-all or by adding a government-sponsored public option plan to the marketplaces.

Longtime Heritage staffers predicted the current dispute would pass quickly.
It's unlikely the administration is going to be able to use an executive order that Americans are going to be able to notice before the election, said Benedic Ippolito, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute. It's an incredibly ambitious timeline.
If you're furloughed, you likely will hold on to your health insurance. Check with your employer about how you'll make contributions while going without a paycheck.
I won't bother regurgitating the oft-repeated speculations among my journalistic colleagues and various insider types about why Trump nominated Moore and is trying to have the courts void the ACA, a.k.a. Obamacare, even though that endangers Republicans who are running for election or reelection to Congress.
Wendell Primus, a senior Pelosi health policy aide, said there was concern talk around Medicare-for-all was taking attention away from the health care agenda that helped Democrats win back the House.
Meanwhile, a government-wide assault is underway on any entity that tries to protect citizens; indeed, if an agency has the word protection in its name, it's almost certainly being targeted. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which works to prevent the financial industry from preying on consumers, is particularly galling to Republicans, perhaps because it has returned $11.8 billion to 29 million consumers who were victimized by misconduct by banks, payday lenders and credit card companies. Ted Cruz has introduced legislation to abolish it, while a bill championed by Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would limit the bureau's enforcement authority, reduce its ability to make rules and repeal its consumer complaint system.

But the same vaccine could not work? You take a solid flu vaccine — you don't think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?
That's according to a letter sent by AAA and other emergency responder associations to Senate leaders last month, asking them to address the issue by passing legislation from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.).
The calculus is clear here. Trump and his team know how difficult this will be, and attaching themselves to it at this early date risks making it their failure if it goes down. But that also makes actually passing the bill much more difficult for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).
The paper, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research, found the economic ramifications of being blocked from access to an abortion lasts for years … when compared with women who have abortions — and crucially, compared with those who choose to have an abortion and then go on to have a child later.

Marino's departure will leave the GOP with 198 seats, as the outcome of the House race in North Carolina remains unresolved, Mike writes. Pennsylvania's governor will have to set a date for a special election to fill the seat.
Attorney General William P. Barr plans to redact some information from Mueller's report, such as grand jury material, before turning it over to Congress. Democrats are seeking access to all of Mueller's findings and underlying evidence.
That would mean it could pass with Democratic support alone, although that is not necessarily as simple as it might sound, considering the measure would have to pass muster with a caucus whose members range from Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on the left to Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) on the right.
Conservatives are pushing for the amendment to be included in the core legislation to ensure that it has enough votes to pass. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said the final decision about what to include in the legislation would depend on CBO estimates of the budgetary and coverage impact for each proposal.
Republicans from states that embraced the law's Medicaid expansion also concede that it has benefited large portions of the low-income population, many of whom were previously uninsured.
WALLACE: The deficit this year is $544 billion. That's more than a half trillion dollars. Your numbers don't add up, sir.
Sanders would have been better off sticking to his guns. Yes, his plan is an unaffordable pipe dream; the overwhelming opposition it would trigger could undo his administration within its first 100 days.
Frankly, it's not a material thing right now, he added.
Higgins is one of several Democrats on the House Budget Committee who have proposed a total of three separate and contrasting bills to expand Medicare to more people. The others are Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who have a bill to expand Medicare to all ages while still preserving employer-sponsored coverage, and Jayapal.

Since World War II, American Protestants have tended to group themselves into three broad categories: fundamentalism on the right, mainline Protestantism on the left and evangelicalism somewhere in between.
On a tour around the state, Warren stopped earlier Monday at the Sweet Maple Cafe in Conway. When a voter said she was considering backing a more moderate candidate, out of a desire to defeat Trump, Warren replied that she's somewhere in the middle on a continuum between Sanders on the left and Buttigieg and Klobuchar in the middle.

Then, if people get sick, they may suddenly find themselves for a year being priced on their illness if they live in a state that sought a waiver. Depending on the approach taken by a state, some people might find it difficult to keep up their coverage for a full year before they qualify for prices at the community rate.
While Republicans have largely fallen in line with Trump on free trade and immigration even when he has blown up GOP orthodoxy, many rely heavily on donations from the pharmaceutical industry and are reluctant to sour those relationships.

This is wrong. Murders have declined significantly in Philadelphia over the past decade, from 397 in 2007 to 277 in 2016; the number has been below 300 for four straight years in a city that neared 500 in 1990. Not only that, but police records reviewed by the Philadelphia Inquirer showed that in 2016, there were fewer violent crimes than in any other year since 1979, the fewest number of property crimes since 1971, and the fewest number of robberies since 1969.

Goldman Sachs sees the economy contracting as much as 34 percent over April, May and June, but springing back to life with 19 percent growth in July, August and September, which would be the market's best ever turnaround.

-- Vanity Fair, 'Journalism is not About Creating Safe Spaces': Inside the Woke Civil War at the New York Times, by Joe Pompeo: Late in the evening on November 8, 2016, The New York Times newsroom was being whipsawed. Donald Trump, to the utter shock and horror of the coastal establishment, was winning. … From a journalistic perspective, that wasn't exactly a bad thing. The new story, after all, was more fascinating, more chaotic — utterly unprecedented. And Trump's election was the kind of Earth-shattering event that only comes around once or twice in a newsperson's career. So for someone like Dean Baquet, the Times's then 60-year-old executive editor, the dominant emotion was exhilaration about this new national epic. But it didn't go unnoticed that, for some in the newsroom, the journalistic mission was not exactly front of mind. … [A source said,] 'That was the first indication that a unified newsroom in the age of Trump was going to be a very difficult thing to achieve or maintain.'
After the year we've had, it makes more sense than ever to plan for the possibility that we'll need to nope out of this godforsaken planet.

Today you can still find such rhetoric, but you have to look for it. Social conservatives are getting exorcised about transgender rights — but much of the party seems uninterested in taking up this rallying cry.

Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.
This was a forceful, aggressive and alive Biden, there to remind us he's far from beaten. He went after Sanders, blaming him for legislation that gave the gun industry an exemption from civil liability. While you were representing your constituency [in a gun state] … all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands, he said. (Sanders confessed he had changed his mind on the issue.) Biden also took issue with court packing and turned it into an issue of electability and winning back the Senate. In contrast with past debates when he wandered into dangerous territory on race, he was clear and coherent on his record on civil rights.
It's hard to tell when a Trump threat is idle and when it's real. Part of it depends on how close to an election it is. That Graham wasn't up until 2020 gave him the space to rebuild his relationship. When Trump attacked then-Rep. Mark Sanford (S.C.) on the day of the Republican primary contest in South Carolina, though, there wasn't anything Sanford could do about it.
Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent the three PBMs letters yesterday asking them to explain their own role in the higher prices paid by patients at the pharmacy counter.
A writer for The Atlantic pointed this out:
OAN's journalists include conservatives, moderates and liberals, but employees across the political spectrum said they often chafed at the restrictions that came down from Mr. H, as they called Robert Herring.
Scott Pruitt, for example, spent six years suing the Environmental Protection Agency as Oklahoma's attorney general. Now he's running it. He's already done a great deal to narrow the scope of the agency's mission and halted inquiries launched by his predecessor. Soon after getting confirmed, for instance, he told operators of oil and gas wells that they could ignore the agency's previous requests for information about their equipment's emissions of methane.
All 10 candidates raised their hands when a moderator asked if their proposed government health-care plans would cover undocumented immigrants.
The case: Whether a 2017 decision by Congress to remove Obamacare's penalty for not buying health insurance — what is called the individual mandate — meant that the requirement to purchase health insurance was itself unconstitutional.
The fate of the Senate's health-care bill remained uncertain Tuesday, although McConnell told reporters he plans to release a revised bill by Thursday morning and hopes to receive a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the new version by the beginning of next week so the chamber can vote quickly.
Pope Francis concluded a Vatican summit by calling for an all-out battle against clerical sex abuse. But he laid out few specifics, and victims complained that church officials sidestepped major decisions while making points that should have been clear years ago. (Chico Harlan and Michelle Boorstein) A federal judge ruled that the all-male military draft is unconstitutional now that women are eligible for combat roles. The case was brought by a men's rights group that argued the draft is unfair, but the ruling did not come in the form of an injunction. A commission is expected to release a report next year on the future of the draft. (USA Today) Chicago will hold its mayoral race tomorrow, but most election observers expect the contest to head to an April runoff. With a modern-day-record number of candidates and low voter turnout expected, most experts see little chance of one contender garnering more than 50 percent of the vote. (Chicago Tribune) Violent storms in the Southeast killed at least two people. A Mississippi woman was killed by a tornado that struck her town, and a man in Tennessee died after driving into floodwaters.

(Jonathan O'Connell) An alleged terrorist was fatally shot after he attempted to hijack a plane headed to Dubai.
— And here are a few more good reads:
It's true that voter support for more traditional Democratic candidates in the race outstripped the support that Sanders attracted in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Even if you add the votes that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) got to Sanders's total, the left-progressive side of the party got only roughly 35 percent of the vote.
Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.
-- Federal prosecutors said former national security adviser Michael Flynn deserves to serve up to six months in prison, reversing their earlier recommendation that he should get probation after his attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department. Spencer S. Hsu and Rachel Weiner report: The government revoked its request for leniency weeks after Flynn's sentencing judge categorically rejected Flynn's claims of prosecutorial misconduct and that he had been duped into pleading guilty to lying to FBI agents about his Russian contacts after the 2016 U.S. election. … Flynn faces sentencing Jan. 28 before U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington. Flynn defense attorney Sidney Powell is scheduled to file his sentencing request Jan. 22. … Flynn, 61, pleaded guilty Dec. 1, 2017, to lying about his communications with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, becoming the highest-ranking Trump official charged and one of the first to cooperate with Mueller's office.
He spoke of having worked with Mueller during his past service in the Justice Department and said it was vitally important that the Special Counsel be allowed to complete his investigation.
As the longest shutdown in history continues, President Trump's options for reopening the government are becoming limited. Here are a few paths he could take. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
* DEMS MOUNT BIG STATE-LEVEL PUSH: USA Today reports that Democratic legislators in 30 states are planning a coordinated release of legislation to help working people, to contrast with Trump's expected agenda in his address to Congress:
For one thing, the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is kaput. Republicans' partisan decision to nix it as part of their tax overhaul could counteract two highly touted bipartisan bills aimed at stabilizing Obamacare's insurance marketplaces. That move irked Democrats, who may be prompted to back away from those across-the-aisle measures.
The latter is a position Sinema has staked out before — making her vote Friday no surprise — and one she reiterated in a statement earlier Friday.
The Association for Community Affiliated Plans: The Supreme Court leaves in place the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the Affordable Care Act. … Plans will postpone investment and innovation in the individual market, dampening competition. Consumers will be left to wonder about the fate of important consumer protections against discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions, lifetime coverage caps, and rescissions of coverage.
Days after Boylan accused Cuomo of sexual harassment in a series of Twitter posts in December, people tied to the governor started circulating an open letter that they hoped former staff members would sign.
Back on the ground, though, Stanley was back to no.
McConnell, 74, spoke to The Post for more than 20 minutes Thursday, calmly answering questions and seeking to describe his deviations from the president diplomatically.
Here's how The Daily Beast's Sam Stein put it:
Denis McDonough, Biden's nominee for VA secretary, is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate today.
I look at what we were able to achieve in Colorado, and in every case it was because we were able to sit down with people who were feuding and at each other's throats, said Hickenlooper, who is expected to announce his presidential plans next month. We were able to get them to put down their weapons.
Sean Spicer really wants you to know: This health care thing isn't Trump's fault (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
This is something that should have been done three or four years ago, but better late than never, said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax). Between 350,000 and 400,000 Virginians will get the health care that's needed.
Since the Congressional Budget Office released its cost estimate of the Obamacare alternative last week, showing steep coverage losses, the legislation's approval rating has dipped six points, from 46 percent to 40 percent. Obamacare's approval rating, on the other hand, sits at 46 percent, as it did in February
To compare extreme in- and out-party animosity, we asked, Have you ever wished that someone would physically injure one or more politicians? While 82 percent said no, 12 percent said they wished someone would injure politicians in the opposing party. Four percent of partisans said they wished someone would injure leaders in both parties, and 1 percent said they wished injury mostly for leaders in their own party.

He also did not follow Klobuchar's lead when she asked him if he would commit to not jail reporters for doing their jobs reporting on the department. Barr answered that he could conceive of situations . . . as a last resort when holding a reporter in contempt would be a reasonable action, where a news organization has run through a red flag or something like that.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
I'll say it for the zillionth time: We will not let the Trump administration rip health care away from millions of Americans, she said Tuesday on Twitter. Not now. Not ever.
-- Nancy Pelosi is coming to a TV screen near you. Bloomberg News's John McCormick and Arit John report: [Pelosi] has been pictured or mentioned more than three times as often in broadcast television campaign spots for federal office when compared to the same point in the last midterm campaign four years ago. That's roughly 7,000 TV ads so far this year, according to data from Kantar Media's CMAG, which tracks political advertising. … She even figures in Republican primary fights. A challenger running for the party's nomination against 12-term Republican Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina has also used Pelosi in his ads, as he's tried to suggest the incumbent is too liberal for the district.
Given Democrats' attitude, I know of nothing that Republicans and Democrats can agree on to stabilize the individual health insurance market, Alexander wrote.

That's not to say there aren't legitimate concerns that paying for virtual care could prompt more waste and fraud in the health-care system. Former officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told me they worry some health providers might view expanded telehealth reimbursement merely as new chances to pocket cash, not as opportunities to improve care.
He's got to pull it off. Mitch has to pull it off, Trump said, referencing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Trump appeared to be responding to criticism of his heavily political speech in front of the CIA's fabled memorial wall. He claimed to have received standing ovations, but he never invited the employees to take a seat. So they remained standing the whole time. (Trump later in the week repeated that he got a standing ovation.)
AHH: The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration and a group of red states to respond by the end of the week to an appeal from California and 19 other Democrat-led states to quickly hear a case challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The states asked the high court last week to consider the case during its current term.
Who: Democrats, Democrats, led by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), expect near-unanimous support from their caucus and zero Republican backing. The bill passed the House during the last Congress when Democrats won back the majority, but it didn't advance in Mitch McConnell's Senate. The bill is still likely to hit a roadblock in the Senate, however, where it's not clear there would be enough Republican support to overcome a filibuster, CNN reports
Along those lines, the National Institutes of Health says it's pursuing more research on medicines that help people overcome addiction, at the request of top Energy and Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). Pallone released a letter from NIH yesterday outlining its intention to conduct a review of the role these medications play in treating opioid use disorder.
Electability matters down the ballot as well. If Sanders is the nominee, he will face the spectacle of Democrats in swing states and districts running from his agenda, not toward it. To date, Sanders does not have a single endorsement from a lawmaker on the Democrats' Frontline list — the House Democrats facing tough races, many in districts Trump won in 2016. That is not an accident.
Democratic operatives are already signaling that they will go hard at GOP fiscal priorities in the general election. As Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson recently put it, all of these GOP candidates are aligned with a set of priorities that include bit tax cuts at the top, opposition to raising the federal minimum wage (if not getting rid of it entirely), and nothing to alleviate student debt or address gender pay inequity.
But I also think it sends a strong statement.
By staking out this position so early in the campaign season, Buttigieg didn't fall prey to some of the accusations of flip-flopping that have plagued Warren. Warren, who says she wants Medicare-for-all, qualified her position last fall by saying she wouldn't push for it until the third year of her presidency.
The wind, though, may be shifting as Biden's comments indicated. Some Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), who firmly rejects ending the filibuster, say they could see making its use more painful by forcing senators to endlessly stall a bill by talking on the floor. Right now, a simple signal of objection can derail legislation.
King was not a communist; he criticized communism for denying God. But he was a political radical in his time, promoting peaceful lawbreaking to protest racial injustice — in God's name, no less. And he was unsparing in his criticism of godly men who failed to do the same. Writing from a Birmingham, Ala., jail, in 1963, King expressed his disappointment in White ministers for failing to call out segregation as morally sinful. He also had choice words for White moderates, whom he described as a greater stumbling block to racial justice than even the Ku Klux Klan. (Suffice it to say, King never ran for statewide office in Georgia.)
Meghan McCain, the late senator's daughter, offered thinly veiled criticism of Trump during a eulogy for her father and has been far more outspoken in recent days.
Trump made no mention in his address of his Democratic opponent, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump yet lost to him in the electoral college.
For example, after Trump rationalized violence on the part of right-wing protesters and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville in 2017, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) spoke out against him. Graham's criticism was a disgusting lie, Trump tweeted, and he assured the senator that the people of South Carolina will remember!

Indivior first received orphan drug status back in the 1990s for its medication Subutex, an oral version of buprenorphine. The company was able to receive the designation by arguing it couldn't reasonably expect to recover its costs of developing the drug – an alternative pathway to getting orphan drug status that has been used only two other times.

The bill would be a major shift for the state, which currently allows women to seek an abortion in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The measure allows exceptions to prevent death or serious harm to the woman, in cases in which the pregnancy is 'medically futile' because the fetus would not be able to live after birth, and in cases of rape or incest in which a police report has been filed, Sarah writes.

Stop the surge of violent crime and homicides in Chicago within one week. (Chicago has recently experienced its highest crime and homicide rate in decades. Regardless of the cause, Trump didn't stop the surge — much less in one week.)
OOF: President Trump told tech executives that the Senate health-care bill needs more heart, a source tells CNBC. The president made the comment in a Monday meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook and other industry executives, according to the report. If true, it would be the second time Trump privately criticized GOP legislation replacing big parts of Obamacare, after telling a group of senators last week that it's mean.
We didn't know how good we had it, Kreidler said. We were always having disagreements with HHS, but they'd listen to us. Right now, I don't think [HHS] listens to us – that's the big difference.

The poll also found a 79 percent majority of people say decisions about abortions should be made by women in consultation with their doctors, compared with 20 percent who say lawmakers should decide when abortions should be made available and under what conditions.
-- In a closed-door meeting after Trump's defense wrapped up, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told colleagues he doesn't yet have the votes to block witnesses. But he and his leadership team feel they're making progress toward that goal. Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade report: Just four GOP senators would have to join with Democrats … An initial vote to allow witnesses, expected Friday, does not ensure witnesses would actually be called, since the Senate would have to subsequently hold separate votes on summoning each individual witness. And Trump's ultimate acquittal still remains all but assured, since a two-thirds vote in the GOP-run Senate would be required to remove him. … Democrats strongly oppose calling either of the Bidens or agreeing to any witness 'trade,' as suggested by some Republicans. Other plans floated by GOP senators have drawn similar Democratic resistance, including the idea of getting the White House to release Bolton's manuscript for senators to review. …
In another, a brain researcher said he was told to leave, then delayed at security for nearly an hour filling out online forms.

— Republican leaders on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are asking their Democratic counterparts to hold a hearing on Medicare-for-all, anxious to highlight how expensive such a plan could be. Ranking member Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and health subcommittee leader Rep.

1. He asked Congress for funding to support the administration's new effort to end new HIV transmissions in a decade.
The fact is that the pandemic has not seriously financially harmed most Americans, and many of those who have been harmed found relief in earlier measures. Savings rates are at a record high, and personal income as a whole is up, not down, since the pandemic struck. This is also true for average and low-income households. A December report from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that checking account balances were up by as much as 40 percent for all income groups. This was before the December stimulus checks were sent, so we should expect that cash cushions have increased even more since then. Some people are clearly hurting, but already-approved measures have largely prevented mass poverty.
5. His administration slashed funding to help people sign up for Obamacare: Remember those navigators? Every enrollment season, they try to guide uninsured people from a variety of backgrounds to use the online marketplace to directly purchase health insurance. In July, the Trump administration announced it was cutting most of the funding for these outreach coordinators for the fall enrollment season.
-- Possibly suspicious grant-making decisions at the DOJ prompted a whistleblower complaint. From Reuters: The internal complaints happened after two nonprofits were denied funding in favor of two less established groups whose applications were not recommended by career DOJ officials. The awarding of more than $1 million total to the two groups, Hookers for Jesus in Nevada and the Lincoln Tubman Foundation in South Carolina, has triggered a whistleblower complaint filed by the Justice Department's employee union to the department's Inspector General. An internal department memo seen by Reuters shows that as of September 12, two long-established nonprofits – the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Palm Beach and Chicanos Por La Causa of Phoenix – were originally on the list of recommended grant winners after receiving high marks from outside contractors hired to review applications. The annual grants help nonprofits and local governments aid human trafficking victims.

That Krauthammer accomplished all he did from a wheelchair is one piece of his legacy — and for me, a journalist with cerebral palsy, it is the piece that left the deepest impression, writes The Fix's Callum Borchers. I did not know Krauthammer personally; though we wrote for the same newspaper, we did not work from the same newsroom. Still, I always viewed him as an impressive and inspirational figure. The reality is there are not many journalists with disabilities at major news outlets — and even fewer who achieve Krauthammer's level of success.

Trump specifically mentioned Ohio. But Anthem Insurance, saying it would leave the state's exchange, cited the lack of certainty about the cost-sharing payments and an increasing lack of overall predictability. So Trump, decrying the broken promise represented by the departure of insurance companies, blames Obamacare for problems that his administration has fostered.
Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.
--Yesterday House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he's aiming for incremental reforms to health care this year instead of full Obamacare repeal, an effort that failed dramatically in the Senate last year. I think the best chance we have is going after incremental entitlement reform since the fact the Senate couldn't pass it, Ryan said on Fox Business.

-- Another big wake-up call for Republicans: Liberal judge Rebecca Dallet won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, defeating Michael Screnock by 11 points. Both candidates and their supporters turned the race, which is technically nonpartisan, into a political referendum, Dave Weigel reports. Dallet ran early ads that accused President Trump of 'attack[ing] our civil rights and our values,' while Screnock portrayed himself as a 'rule of law' conservative endorsed by the National Rifle Association. By election day, more than $2.5 million had been spent on TV ads. Democrats had not won an open Supreme Court seat election in the Badger State since 1995.

The IRS said it is aware of the problems, but is limited in what it can do to help quickly. Taxpayers trying to sort out why they got an inaccurate check — or nothing at all when they qualified for a payment — are unable to communicate with the IRS. With the tax filing deadline delayed to July 15, the agency closed the last of its service centers — in Ogden, Utah — early last week, and the IRS had not been able to expand a pilot telework program for phone agents because of the pandemic, the agency said.

-- The electorate tends to move in the opposite direction of whoever is president, but the scale of the shift on several issues, including immigration, seems historically unusual. Americans became more liberal on a battery of issues when Ronald Reagan was president and more conservative when Obama occupied the Oval Office. Partly this is because ideas that seem good on paper are often less popular in practice. People loved the idea of health care, but implementing Obamacare was a mess. Repealing Obamacare sounded great to a lot of folks who were frustrated by rising premiums and losing their doctors, but many panicked when it looked like they or people they know could get kicked off Medicaid, lose protections for preexisting conditions, etc.
Average insurance premiums in the Obamacare marketplace now are about at the level predicted by the CBO for 2017 when it first evaluated the law in 2009. But premiums have certainly spiked in recent years, as insurance companies grappled with a mix of people in the insurance pools tilted toward people who have chronic illnesses and thus require more care and frequent doctor or hospital visits.
Stephen Miller — the architect of Trump's immigration strategy — briefed GOP lawmakers this week on the Biden administration's immigration changes and urged them to continue hammering away at the issue, which he said could help Republicans in the midterm elections next year. Miller told them that the Democrats' 2010 midterm defeats were the result of President Barack Obama focusing on health-care reform instead of economic issues.

Nonetheless, this major news got largely buried by impeachment coverage last week. Even the vice president didn't seem to know about it, based on an exchange later that day that has since gone viral.
Some of the other health-care proposals under review also appear largely aspirational, for instance, a draft executive order that instructs agencies to speed development of a universal flu vaccine, first reported by Politico, but that proposes no new funding. Other efforts, such as the initiatives to reduce HIV infections and end-stage kidney disease, and double the number of transplants, contain new funding and have been widely heralded.
This broken budget process sets the polarized parties up for repeated brinkmanship. That's how we got the recent shutdown. Deadlines can force an otherwise dysfunctional Congress to act. But they also can allow the parties to delay working out their differences, turning votes over short-term spending bills into battles over the parties' governing priorities. So long as lawmakers disagree over the size and scope of federal programs, they will keep fracturing over the budget.

* TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE MOSTLY P.R.: Charlie Savage looks at Trump's latest executive orders on crime fighting and concludes there isn't much new in them in terms of substantive policy. They seem to reiterate support for existing approaches. Per one expert:
In the aftermath of the rioting, one District resident compared the city to a war zone. The damage was staggering — at least $175 million in today's dollars. More than 900 businesses were damaged, including half of the city's 383 liquor stores. Nearly 700 dwellings were destroyed, most because they were above or next to merchants. Police arrested 7,600 adults and juveniles on riot-related charges. Bustling blocks were reduced to rubble.
4. What can Democrats do with 50 Senate votes?
Why? Cultural issues play a role, to be sure, as does the sheer force of Trump's personality. But also because this type of an agenda, and, more importantly, the concern and priorities it communicates, are not what many people think of when they hear the words conservative and Republican, and the leaders of both groups have not done the necessary work over the past many years to change that impression.

Near the end of Bennet's remarks, his voice level again, the senator said: I don't even know what day it is anymore of this record-long shutdown. But the pretext for it is an invention. It's a creation of something in the president's mind.
Lawmakers introduce bills all the time, and there's little reason to believe that either of these plans will pass or even earn a vote. But if there were ever an environment conducive to such a bill, this could be it.
— A federal panel remanded two cases from the multidistrict lawsuit against opioid companies to their respective federal courts on Wednesday, per court records. The Cherokee Nation and the city and county of San Francisco will face off with companies including Purdue Pharma and McKesson.
Currently phone calls to the EEOC, which handles discrimination cases, go to a voice mail greeting: You've reached the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Because of the lapse of appropriations, the EEOC is currently closed. We will not be returning messages from this mailbox until the government reopens.
In other words, the battle lines will roughly divide between GOP leaders, party strategists, and establishment figures who are urging one set of lessons to be drawn from the defeat (that the party needs to make peace with cultural and demographic change), and Trump supporters who are urging that a very different set of lessons be drawn (that the party must embrace Trump's species of ethno-nationalism and xenophobic, America First populism). As one congressional expert puts it: I expect civil war within the GOP after November 8th, as party elites inside and outside of Congress jockey to assign blame and claim the GOP mantle going forward.
On the first day in office, terminate President Obama's executive orders related to immigration. (Trump didn't end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — also known as DACA — until September 2017.)
Speculators across the globe are struggling to determine when or how market watchdogs may rein in an industry that's decentralized and derives much of its value from anonymous ownership. Many assertions that digital coins represent a bubble have triggered double-digit selloffs over the past year, only to be followed by rebounds. In South Korea, shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges is still an option amid ongoing discussions, Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said in an interview with TBS radio Jan. 16. Kim said there's irrational speculation and that rational regulation was needed.
Some congressional aides said Democratic lawmakers may be open to making the switch after the program is up and running. Still, Gleckman disputed that the Social Security Administration would be better equipped to send the payments, particularly given Democrats' insistence on tying the benefits to family earnings.
AHH: Covid-19 killed 3,865 people in the U.S. yesterday.
For many politicians, that would be a bad — very bad — moment, caught misstating facts. But Trump knows that his appeal isn't based on whether he got the exact facts on his electoral college margin right. It's on the fact that he won — big league. And who cares if he was wrong? It's the media nitpicking him to death, after all.
-- Florida Republicans hope Trump's push to oust Maduro will aid their electoral fortunes. Sean Sullivan reports: Opposition to the socialist regime in Caracas, which is closely aligned with communist Cuba, has been a shared cause of the state's large and traditionally pro-Republican Cuban American and Venezuelan immigrant communities. … Florida Democrats are disavowing the recent refusal by [Bernie Sanders] to label Maduro a dictator and call for him to go, though Sanders has criticized him.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
House Republicans are advancing a series of bills that would make changes to the civil justice system long sought by doctors and U.S. corporations, including a cap on some medical malpractice awards and new roadblocks for classes of people seeking to sue jointly to address harm.
Dood I don't care, Silverman tweeted. I'm fine. I see something in you. My gut tells me you could have a great life. My shrink says we don't get what we want, we get what we think we deserve. I'm telling you, you deserve so much more than you know.
-- Barr also announced the DOJ will sue so-called sanctuary jurisdictions over policies he considers overly friendly to undocumented migrants. Zapotosky and Barrett report: Barr announced the lawsuits in a speech to the National Sheriffs' Association, saying they were part of 'a significant escalation in the federal government's efforts to confront the resistance of 'sanctuary cities.'' He said he also was reviewing the practice of some state and local prosecutors who charge criminals with lesser offenses to avoid deportation, and giving non-sanctuary jurisdictions priority when it comes to awarding certain grant money. In separate federal fillings, the Justice Department sought to block a New Jersey policy that limits how state and local authorities share information with federal immigration officials and to stop a county in Washington state from preventing immigration authorities from using an international airport there for deportations.
And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. I've spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning. Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.
I don't know if he lied or not. He could have lied. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't. I guess you'd have to ask him.
— A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
Trump's method is starkly different from many previous presidents who have sought to usher their high-profile aims through Congress and drive negotiations early in their first terms.
Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto asked this question to Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.): If the president did tell John Bolton that, indeed, there was a relationship between getting that information on the Bidens and aid to the country, that wouldn't be enough for you to say, let's look into this more?
Sanders's plan proposes slowly phasing in Medicare for All over the period of four years, giving hospitals and doctors time to adjust to the new spending levels. And his staffers do not necessarily mind the prospect of hospitals earning slightly less in the long-run, with spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis saying this bill is not designed to make shareholders of for-profit hospitals wealthier.
The IRS systems are still hard-coded, said John Koskinen, who was IRS commissioner from 2013 to 2017. It's not just a keystroke to go into the code and make the change and hope you've made it correctly. When you set up a new portal like this, it requires you to get into some very old legacy systems.
The new report touts those efforts and a wide variety of other steps taken by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other departments within the sprawling agency, which oversees prescription drugs and devices, protects public health and administers the government's big health insurance programs.
[Alleged shooter Brenton Harrison] Tarrant had a gun license and used a variant of the AR-15, a semiautomatic weapon that has been used in many mass shootings in the United States, including in at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in 2018; on the Las Vegas Strip in 2017; and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.
We just want more specifics, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Wednesday. We need to know what we're going to replace it with. Meadows said he was personally undecided on his vote Friday and that other caucus members were leaning toward no.
Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) entered the state's 2022 Senate race. Fetterman kicked off his campaign for retiring Sen. Pat Toomey's (R) seat this morning, CNN reports. The Democratic primary campaign is expected to be crowded and competitive, but Fetterman has already raised more than $1.3 million from over 43,000 donations in the weeks since he first publicly considered a bid.
In more than two dozen interviews with corporate executives and business lobbyists over the past month, I found no support for Trump's candidacy. Most of them agreed to speak only if they were not identified.
Ryan's staff and House GOP leaders immediately claimed Tuesday that Trump had moved to settle the dispute.
Lawmakers used the hearing to question leaders of several leading U.S. Olympic sport organizations about their ability to protect athletes from sexual abuse. Nassar, 54, is serving an effective life sentence in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting nine girls and women in Michigan, as well as to federal child pornography crimes. Perry apologized to Nassar's victims and vowed, Those days are over.

Like Warren, Klobuchar emphasized that she's been underestimated her whole life and especially throughout this campaign, outlasting many rivals who entered the contest with national name recognition and larger donor networks. On the anniversary of her outdoor announcement amid a blizzard back home in Minnesota, she asked Granite Staters for their help to surprise the country.
Wright, 35, has been charged with felony reckless endangerment and was released after posting a $1,000 bond. Authorities say they found her after she posted details of the encounter with Kustoff on Facebook.
Trump predicted the GOP would win back both chambers of Congress and retain the White House.
Experts say companies, especially social media platforms, are being tasked with new and challenging responsibilities as they learn to navigate the line between doing business and playing the role of censor in an age when misleading claims about health and science can have a profound impact on public health, as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports. At the same time, some anti-vaccination advocates suggest the crackdowns violate First Amendment rights, limit alternative views and give Big Pharma an upper hand.
The company hasn't made a final decision about the bankruptcy filing, per the report.
One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has put forth a tax-deduction-based plan that has been embraced by hard-line House conservatives. Leaving Wednesday's briefing, Paul said he would not support refundable tax credits: I'm not in favor of keeping parts of Obamacare.
Health 202: So what can be done about the high deductibles we've seen in the marketplace plans?
AHH: China announced it would ban all types of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, listing all variants of the powerful drug as controlled substances, our Post colleague Gerry Shih reports. The decision follows a vow Chinese leader Xi Jinping made to President Trump during a December meeting.
They are appalled by Trump, a top executive said of his colleagues. They want to end the dysfunction, not make it worse.
The ACA has never done a good job of taking people who lost a job and getting them health insurance, Dorn said. This bill takes a more serious effort than we've ever done in our history to provide health insurance to people who lose their jobs.
Trump's staffers are regularly reticent to comment publicly or privately about the administration's position on a number of health-care-related issues. In large part, they worry that Trump will almost immediately undercut them with his own words or tweets.
Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Rachel the poll's findings on a Medicare buy-in option reflect support for another option. In the mind of the person answering it, they're hearing choice. And that's not Medicare for All, which everybody in America has the same card, he said.
Oh, and Russia. Pretty much everyone in Washington except Trump wants to slap sanctions on Russia, Ryan included. (I think Russia is a global menace led by a man who is menacing, he said Thursday.)
This fall, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is slated to argue in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of 17 Republican attorneys general — and against 21 Democratic attorneys general — that Obamacare is unconstitutional and must be struck down immediately. Representatives for five of those attorneys general — from the states of Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee — confirmed to The Daily Beast that the coronavirus outbreak has not changed their plans to try and kill the health care law as parties to the case of Texas v. California. Their steadfastness comes even as their states are beginning to feel the acute impact of the coronavirus' spread.
I am deeply concerned about [the] apparent misuse of millions of dollars in funding meant for public health emergencies like the one our country is currently facing with the covid-19 pandemic, special counsel Henry Kerner wrote in a letter to Biden on Wednesday. Equally concerning is how widespread and well-known this practice appeared to be for nearly a decade.
3. The guy who won three national championships as head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers (Bobby Knight, who is also known for throwing a chair onto the court during a game)
But I also want to move towards integrated care. And that is the fragmentation of the health-care system that drives everybody crazy. You go for an operation and here's what you ask: Does my insurance cover this? And the answer is yes. And then afterwards you find out the anesthesiologist was out of network and you say what does that mean. Who asks whether everybody is in network that's in your operating room? You don't even know who your anesthesiologist is. You have no personal relationship with your anesthesiologist.
--Legendary musician Tom Petty, who recently died of an accidental drug overdose, had a host of risk factors associated with opioid addiction: Chronic pain from a fractured hip, an ongoing battle with severe depression and a long history of substance abuse. Over at Stat News, Lipi Roy, an addiction medicine doctor, lays out a few science-backed ideas that could perhaps have prevented Petty's death.
Domestic developments that shouldn't be overlooked
Health 202: We know how well it worked for Obama when he promised 'If you like it, you can keep it' and then some people lost their plans. That's really potent.
It's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky argued in her 2015 book, Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Hollis-Brusky documented the impact of such a community: Focusing on key recent Supreme Court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with Federalist Society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.
NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:
The Trump administration has made plenty of other unforced errors on health policy, many of which are directly related to its handling of the coronavirus epidemic or otherwise laid bare by it.
Many Kentuckians, of course, do not even think it is worthy of a trial. Around the bar at PeeWee's — a dimly lit but highly spirited watering hole popular among local Republicans — even mention of the i-word elicits sputtering condemnations of Democrats for daring to try to take down the best president we've ever had.
Update: We were so focused on fact-checking the 129 million number that we neglected to consider the second part of her statement — that these people could be denied coverage. The problem is that the AHCA does not change the ACA's guarantee of coverage. The rule for debating the amendment actually included a line to clarify any possible ambiguity, though it sounds more like a public relations exercise — that nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.
Any hope that Trump would avoid distracting fights once he entered the Oval Office faded on the fifth full day of his presidency as several hundred GOP lawmakers loaded onto a rented Amtrak train to head north for a two-day retreat half a mile from Independence Hall.
The Senate Special Committee on Aging holds a hearing on prescription drug prices on Thursday.
The Democrats are now advancing an extreme $100 trillion government takeover called the Green New Deal.
— Chamber to push gas tax. The Post's John Wagner: With President Trump and Congress turning their attention to infrastructure in the coming weeks, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is preparing for an uphill battle: a push to raise the federal gas tax by 25 cents per gallon to help pay for the initiative.
Republican voters strongly supported the idea of Medicaid expansion when it was tied to Trump, according to an internal poll conducted by the House Republican Caucus and obtained by The Washington Post.
Members of the Sackler family will pay $75 million in personal funds as part of a $270 million out-of-court settlement agreement Purdue made with the state of Oklahoma last week.
Goodman previously issued a statement suggesting that Schumer's comments had been blown out of proportion and that he meant the justices would be met with a political movement if they vote the wrong way. It's a reference to the political price Republicans will pay for putting them on the court and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grass-roots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision, Goodman said.
Agreements that fully comply with the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) cannot be amended and can be passed by a simple majority. But the USMCA did not comply: The implementing legislation was not submitted to Congress 30 days before a committee or floor vote on it, a requirement necessary if Congress is to perform its constitutional duty to establish trade policy. Also, the TPA requires that the implementing legislation contain only provisions strictly necessary or appropriate for implementation. Otherwise, the TPA's expedited process could be used to sneak extraneous matters into law without adequate scrutiny, or possible opposition through amendment, or a 60-vote threshold. But for the first time ever, implementing legislation contained appropriations, $843 million, including $50 million for salaries and expenses for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which was designated an emergency.
The letter references the coverage losses in Arkansas, which has dropped 18,000 people from its Medicaid rolls for failing to comply with work rules.
The agreement between the federal government and the states could simply be a way for the White House to avoid a legal battle with the states, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, but it's also reflective of the schizophrenia of this administration with respect to the Affordable Care Act.
The ACA helped remedy the problem but didn't eliminate it.
Safety standards for organ procurement organizations, like LAORA, are enforced by UNOS, which works under contract with the government. When McFarland's transplant took place, LAORA was a member not in good standing of the transplant network, which signals a serious lapse in patient safety or quality of care, according to UNOS.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the legislation, called it a huge step forward to have Pelosi's support. We have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.
Immediately institute a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the workforce through attrition. There would be exceptions for those in the military, public safety and public health. (Trump did so, but it was rescinded April 2017.)
Ah, she could do without it.
And now repealing and replacing the ACA is next to impossible following the swearing-in yesterday of Democrat Doug Jones to replace Sen. Luther Strange (R) of Alabama, giving Republicans just a one-seat Senate majority (they couldn't accomplish that coveted goal even with a two-seat majority in 2017). So Republicans instead are focusing on a host of smaller Obamacare issues including disputes over how to treat insurers and whether to suspend industry taxes.

Kustoff's office has not publicly addressed the incident.
-- Fox News's Tucker Carlson has become one of Trump's most vocal critics on Iran. Kayla Epstein reports: Carlson has used his namesake show to criticize Trump, his military leaders and high-ranking foreign policy officials for their decision to strike. On Friday, the conservative pundit criticized 'chest-beaters' for 'making the usual warlike noises.' On Monday, he questioned why conservatives who were long suspicious of the military and intelligence community were suddenly trusting them on Iran. Carlson is not the only critic of Trump's decision, but he is one of the loudest voices on the right. ... When Carlson broke with Trump on the issue of Iran, viewers, critics and Twitter observers took notice. 'These anti-war segments from Tucker Carlson don't mean he's good now,' former Barack Obama spokesman and 'Pod Save America' host Tommy Vietor tweeted.

We have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine. … I've been on it for 15 times this year.
Verma also shrugged off the small enrollment decline, saying it reflects a lower demand for marketplace coverage because more people are receiving coverage through their workplaces and through Virginia's recent Medicaid expansion. But it's not the first year of declining enrollment. Signups decreased by 400,000 people between 2017 and 2018.
She argues the requirements ignore that Medicaid coverage itself makes it possible for low-income people to maintain employment.

The new Republican health-care plan would let insurers offer plans in the health marketplaces that charge patients with preexisting conditions more. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
We can say two things. One is that getting serious presidential hopefuls to join someone who identifies as a democratic socialist on such a huge vision for government activism is a clear shift in the American political paradigm. But the second is that the public more broadly is still about as wary about socialism as it has been for years. As a result, Republicans will gladly affix that label to this proposal — with an easy assist from Ocasio-Cortez.
It is true that Planned Parenthood recently weathered a major onslaught by Congress to strip it of Medicaid dollars, a GOP effort that died alongside several bills to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It looks unlikely that Republicans will be able to defund Planned Parenthood anytime soon, despite their long promises to do so and strong backing of President Trump and Vice President Pence.
That's delicious. That's refreshing, Gosar said. Got milk? Not under the Green New Deal!
In a brief analysis published online Wednesday, before the Senate's bill became public, the nonpartisan Urban Institute found that the differences between the two measures of inflation could add up to about $467 billion over 10 years, other things being equal.
Pharmaceutical companies and regulators alter flu vaccines to respond to new variants each season. Instead of enrolling thousands of people for months-long trials, researchers prove safety and effectiveness in smaller trials.
A doctor asked Vice President Pence in Iowa (which holds its caucuses in the presidential race Monday ) about the Medicaid announcement, per this tweet that went viral:
Trump took great pains to distinguish himself from Paul Ryan and limited-government Republicans by vowing no cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, staking out an ideologically heterodox posture that likely helped boost him among working-class white voters. Obviously, that's no longer operative.

He was the little brother I never had and like his late father, he was fair, wise and dedicated to the tasks at hand, said Frank Kilgore, Chafin's brother-in-law.
Based on the report that you've received? Kennedy asked.
-- Meanwhile, the White House — and congressional Republicans — are taking hits for a lack of transparency in Trump's Washington, with important business increasingly being handled behind closed doors. Philip Rucker and Ed O'Keefe report: The federal government's leaders are hiding from public scrutiny — and their penchant for secrecy represents a stark departure from the campaign promises of Trump and his fellow Republicans to usher in newfound transparency. 'I was very frustrated the Obama administration held things so close to the vest … but I quite frankly haven't seen any change with the Trump administration. In some ways I find it worse,' said Jason Chaffetz, [who until recently led the House Oversight Committee] …'I see a bureaucracy that doesn't want documents and the truth out the door … and just flipping the middle finger at Congress,' Chaffetz said.
Asked if he agreed with Trump that the election is rigged, McConnell laughed and walked away. McConnell's silence is especially notable in light of Trump's recent complaints about the election system and hints he might not ultimately accept the results….McConnell has offered no reaction, passing up the opportunity to defend the nation's democratic institutions.
Expect much of the floor discussion next week to center on the need for more medication-assisted treatment, an approach science has shown works but which is sadly under-covered by insurers and under-offered by treatment facilities.

Republicans made their biggest stride yet toward fulfilling their years-long pledge to undo the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, when the House passed a controversial overhaul bill Thursday. The measure now heads to the Senate.
You're not getting that new blood into the risk pools, Ario told me. That's not a good sign.
It remains to a large degree a zero-sum game, which means that every dose that goes to the U.S. or the U.K. or an E.U. country is a dose that's off the shelves, Andrea Taylor, a researcher at Duke University's Global Health Innovation Center who tracks vaccines, told The Washington Post. And the shelves aren't going to be restocked for a while.

Right to Try is a new law the president signed last year, which allows terminally ill patients access to drugs not fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration if they've exhausted all other treatment options. It's the only bill Trump mentioned in last year's State of the Union.
The diverse group, which includes nationally known pastors such as Tim Keller and A.R. Bernard, is expected to include leaders of major ministries, denominations, colleges and seminaries.

In the channel's first couple of years, OAN writers, producers and anchors said they were mostly left alone to determine the content of the newscasts. After Trump announced his candidacy, things changed.
Of the more than 1 million migrants who arrived as part of family groups between 2014 and mid-2020, just 6 percent have been returned home, while 4.7 percent have been granted asylum or some form of legal status, DHS data shows.

It remains an open question how many candidates will seek to appear with Trump heading into next year's elections.
Lilly said the monthly per-patient prices were based on average use of Humalog if taken as prescribed. This amounts to about two vials or more than six pen injectors, though actual utilization may vary by patient, Peter writes.
Quietly, people are preparing for a lot of possible outcomes and how to deal with them, said one Republican in frequent communication with GOP senators and staff, who like other aides and allies interviewed for this story were granted anonymity to speak candidly.
In a statement to Reuters, Sanders said Catalyst was showing a blatant disregard for patients with LEMS, adding he will ask FDA Commissioner [Scott] Gottlieb to act immediately to help patients who are suffering.
He lamented that a comprehensive immigration bill that the Senate passed in 2013 couldn't get a vote in the House, because of the Hastert rule requiring that a majority of the majority party be in favor of any bill brought to the floor.
On Twitter, Bloomberg routinely would insult Trump in colorful terms:
And then some of the other folks on the policy, you know, team; Peter Navarro and some of the designees (inaudible) have been part of those discussions and they're laying out the sequencing. And obviously, Don McGahn, White House counsel's involved in that process. But there's a group that's leading the effort to lay them out both in terms of what the priorities are and what the scheduling of them. On the hiring front, we'll -- hope to have an announcement in the next couple days, you know, today, tomorrow or Thursday, obviously, on an additional couple batches of White House staff. So we -- we've got -- we should have some -- I anticipate those announcements going soon.
House Republicans are objecting to the $1.9 trillion measure being pushed by President Biden and Democrats in Congress to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. As part of the attack, the GOP staff on the House Budget Committee has distributed a pie chart that asserts only a small portion of the bill actually deals with combating the virus.
Now Trump is extending or following up on Obama's efforts, and Democrats have decided that what's good for the goose is good for the gander, concludes Glenn, who awarded Democrats two Pinocchios for their claims. But it's a simplistic way to frame the policy debate, potentially making it more difficult to restrain the growth of entitlement programs.
Make Mexico pay for the wall, 100 percent. If Mexico refuses, then the United States will impound remittance payments taken from the wages of undocumented immigrants, cut foreign aid, institute tariffs, cancel visas for Mexican business leaders and diplomats, and increase fees for visas, border-crossing cards and port use. (None of this has happened.)

But here's the bottom line. And I'll go quickly. We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children's education. Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results. And the people of this town are going to rise. And they need to be involved. Thank you.
He's very sophisticated. He understands the pricing issues. He knows as well as anyone that you're only going to get discounts if you get volume. Look at what we did on AIDS drugs. I worked at the Clinton Foundation for a year. President Clinton negotiated with the pharmaceuticals and promised them millions of people for a highly discounted series of AIDS drugs. So you've got to negotiate out on the basis of large numbers of people to get your costs down.
The House-passed bill includes $1.1 billion in funding to fight the spread of Zika through September 2017, according to House Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers (R-Ky.).
The wrangling over abortion rights — how late into pregnancy the procedure should be allowed and under what circumstances — is an issue that divides the two parties more than ever before and could play a sizable role in the 2020 presidential and congressional elections as Trump seeks to hold the White House, Republicans face some tough races in the Senate and Democrats defend their new House majority.
According to numerous lawmakers and aides in the room, as well as a policy memo distributed afterward, the House leaders laid out elements of a repeal-and-replace plan — including long-standing Republican concepts like health savings accounts, tax credits and state high-risk pools for the chronically sick. But they did not detail how those elements would fit together or get passed into law.
Instead, they found themselves in an all-too-common battle, trying to explain, defend and deflect the latest round of controversial statements by President Trump. Do they agree that as many as 5 million people voted illegally in November? Do they support a proposal to revive secret CIA prisons and possibly torture? What about a draft ban on resettling refugees?
Even after people across the country spoke out and pressed Congress to reject President Trump's plan to gut Medicaid … he's still charging forward with harmful policies that will hurt the many families who rely on Medicaid, said Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
State Medicaid officials say they want to implement the mandate starting in January 2021. Under the plan, certain adults ages 19 to 49 would be required to work at least 80 hours a month to maintain their Medicaid coverage. They will have 60 days to report compliance with the requirement before they are dropped from coverage. However, unlike other states, those who lose coverage can apply to re-enroll in Medicaid immediately.
McCreary, 36, is a special-education teacher. He was working as a substitute when the pandemic caused most schools to shut down last March. Since he was a substitute teacher, he was not on the school district's insurance plan. He had purchased insurance through the health exchange and says he even tried to overestimate his 2020 income to avoid paying a penalty later on, but he ended up being unemployed for most of the year.
That's a myth that can be traced to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the 1939 film in which Jimmy Stewart's character filibusters to heroic effect. In reality, the filibuster has often been deployed to frustrate majority rule, or simply to rally supporters, as when Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina stood on the floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 in an unsuccessful bid to stop a civil rights bill. Under the idea floated by Manchin and others, filibusters would more closely resemble Mr. Smith -- the vote would be delayed only so long as a bill's opponents actively held the floor.
A big factor in that rising rate was a drop-off in children younger than 19 enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. According to another Georgetown analysis, in a 20-month period from December 2017 to August 2019, the number of children younger than 19 in those two programs declined by 2.9 percent.
But, as we explained here, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has encouraged states to undertake even more ambitious changes to their marketplaces — changes the Obama administration wouldn't have allowed for fear of undermining the quality of coverage people can buy.
Usually, firing a person doesn't stop the investigation; that's one of the things I have a little bit of trouble accepting, Barr said. But the basic point is if someone tried to stop a bona fide lawful investigation, to cover up wrongdoing, I would resign.
--On Capitol Hill this week, expect the health-care debate to be at fever pitch. Supporters of the ACA note that it's a pivotal time for the repeal-replace effort, as it becomes clear whether the Senate will be able to get its act together. At the same time, don't forget that any Senate bill would have to be passed by the House or otherwise merged with its version -- so there's still a long, hard road ahead regardless of what happens over the next week or two.
Barr added that it would be understandable that if someone felt they were falsely accused, that the person might view the probe of their conduct like a witch hunt.
On corporate tax rates, We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.
-- The result is that the electoral college has emerged as this week's new litmus test for the crowded field:
Unlike the Democrats who did it last time, and people were talking, you know, as then-Speaker Pelosi said, you know, you're going to have to wait to read what's in the bill, I think they want to do this right this time; make sure that people don't have to wake up and wonder what just happened. And then we plan accordingly to ensure that such a huge priority for the American people is done with -- in an appropriate and methodical manner.
Under the Affordable Care Act championed by President Barack Obama, Washington encouraged states to allow more people to enroll in Medicaid by offering to pick up most of the tab. Thirty-three states, including Maryland, and the District accepted the offer.
— Beyond the bubble. NYT's Steven Johnson: You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment? But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation... The Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system.
I mean, this is how sick the system is. So let me tell you, [when I'm] elected president, everybody in this country will get that vaccine absolutely free, Sanders said to cheers.
The well-documented acrimony between former HHS secretary Alex Azar and former CMS administrator Seema Verma under the Trump administration serves as a recent warning of the dysfunction that can occur when these two influential appointees don't work harmoniously.
Democratic and Republican voters also cast ballots in primaries for the U.S. House and several local races, including for Baltimore mayor. Former Maryland lieutenant governor Anthony G. Brown edged out his closest primary rival to win the Democratic nomination in Maryland's 4th Congressional District. Brown will face Republican George E. McDermott in the general election.
Still, his age is a factor given the increased age differential in the Republican legislation. He also worries about lawmakers' renewed interest in states forming high-risk pools, programs that save insurance companies the financial hardship of covering very costly care.
If you think he isn't going to run and you want his blessing and the energy of the Trump-dedicated voter, I think you're more likely to just … stick to the arguments that 85 percent of the Republican base agrees with, which is impeaching a president already out of office is a useless exercise, the process is rushed, and then throw in a heavy dose of what-about-ism toward the Democrats, Kevin Madden, a former Mitt Romney campaign adviser told Politico's David Siders.
In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood alleges the Center for Medical Progress illegally filmed its employees and released a video to try to falsely show illicit sale of aborted fetal tissue.
-- Also experiencing a boom in memberships: the Democratic Socialists of America. The LA Times' Matt Pearce reports: Holding red and white signs, they protested outside Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's election party on Tuesday, demanding the city take a tougher stand against deportation. The next day, they rallied in support of the International Women's Day strike, demanding social and economic equality for women. These weren't liberals. They were card-carrying members of the Democratic Socialists of America, one of the fastest growing groups on the American left. The surge of activism sweeping the U.S. since [Trump's] election has energized the nation's largest socialist organization, which has tripled in size over the last year to claim more than 19,000 dues-paying members. New members of the Democratic Socialists of America say they want build a grassroots movement engaged at the local level — and either pull the Democratic Party leftward or shove it out of the way.

Ryan Gallucci, director of national veterans services for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that CVA does not represent the views of veterans, noting that VFW members report in surveys that they are happy overall with VA health care, despite its challenges.
But the problem is bigger than prices. A recent analyst's report from Goldman Sachs illustrates the pitfalls of letting the profit motive determine research priorities. As reported by CNBC, the report asked a disturbing question: Is curing patients a sustainable business model? As the report noted, curing many patients of an infectious disease like hepatitis could stop transmission and eliminate new cases, causing profits to plummet. That firms would even ponder such factors may seem nefarious, but it's the inevitable consequence of a profit-obsessed R&D agenda. One noxious side effect of that agenda is the proliferation of drugs that offer no advance over existing agents: The majority of new agents are me-too drugs — trivial modifications of older medications — whose sales are pumped up by aggressive advertising campaigns but do nothing to improve health.
We cannot sustain this level of chaos from the White House and expect it will be anything less than a tragic outcome on Election Day, said Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
Anita Moody, a conservative activist who lives in Morefield's district, called his office, leaving a voice mail to register her disappointment.
While the intensity of the fight is in dispute, one thing is clear: It's not over. Enough House Republicans teamed up with Democrats to pass a state budget bill that would expand Medicaid, but Senate Republicans blocked passage in that chamber, which, like the House, is under narrow GOP control. The standoff forced the legislature to adjourn March 10 without a budget. Legislators need to pass a budget by July 1 to avoid a government shutdown.
And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.
Ever the realist, McConnell is deeply conservative, always a gentleman and the senator you never want opposite your cause. Particularly in a crisis, it's reassuring to know that a legislator who is is sure to rank among the Senate's great leaders is at work for the country, the Constitution and the Republican Party.
His apologists strain to explain that he didn't mean what we heard, Romney writes on Facebook, calling it a defining moment for Trump. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.
Keep tabs on Trump's promises with our Trump Promise Tracker
The latest ACA suit was organized by Republican attorneys general in Texas and other red states. When the Trump administration declined to defend the law, a coalition of Democratic-led blue states entered.
— States would have to request permission. Because CMS is doing this through what's known as a waiver process, states would have to apply for block grants the same way they've always applied for waivers to modify how they run Medicaid or the Obamacare marketplaces.
Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler.
When we couldn't pass the repeal of Obamacare the first way through, an amendment came because the Freedom Caucus wouldn't vote for the original House bill, McCarthy said. That amendment put [the] preexisting condition campaign against us, and so even people who are running for the very first time got attacked on that. And that was the defining issue and the most important issue in the race.
Even before Alexander's statement, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) acknowledged that Trump's tactics with GOP lawmakers had frightened them — indicating he wasn't optimistic about what lay ahead.
The exchange with Jamrozy may have seemed unusual, but for those closest to Silverman, it made perfect sense.
That's hardly a conservative thing, he said.
The concern over how the change could create two separate pools of consumers, paying very different insurance rates, has prompted a group of more moderate rank-and-file senators to pitch a plan that they say would curb the risk of that sort of segmentation. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said he spoke privately with McConnell on Monday night on the Senate floor.
-- Trump slammed George Conway as a total loser, ratcheting up a war of words that appears to have put serious strain on the marriage between the conservative power lawyer and his wife, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. Josh Dawsey and John Wagner report on the family tension that keeps spilling into public view:

Yet Parkinson and others plugged into the right-wing meme sphere remain members in good standing of the Allegheny County Democratic Committee. The controversy over that highlights the national party's dilemma in Pennsylvania and other swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin: voters who consider themselves loyal Democrats but also may be attracted to Trump.
If the president chooses not to enforce the mandate, he's going to drive up the cost for many, many people, Molina said, noting that premiums would probably rise 15 percent if it is not enforced. If cost-sharing reductions are eliminated, he added, premiums would rise an additional 10 to 12 percent.
OUCH: More than a third of American adults are taking medications that carry a risk of depression, including prescription drugs, hormones for contraception, blood pressure medications and heartburn medication, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study found 37 percent of adults in the United States take medicines linked to depression -- and people who take multiple drugs linked with depression are also more likely to be depressed, our colleague Carolyn Y. John reports. It was unclear, however, if this was a result of the medications, or if the people had a medical history of depression prior to taking the drugs.
-- Their ancestors fled U.S. slavery for Mexico. Now they're looking north again, by Kevin Sieff: Their ancestors were African Americans who escaped from the United States to Mexico in the 19th century, fleeing the slave trade for a desert village at the base of the Sierra Madre mountains. They were called the Mascogos, roughly 60 black families who spoke and prayed in English as they hid from the white men who wanted to put them back in shackles. ... Now members of this community of 300 are heading back to the United States.
Republicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the Senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. That means the narrow Democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 Republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. And with the slimmest possible majority, Democrats will have to stick together. A single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.

Trump shared a video recap of India's welcome:
If this package was about creating more jobs, why is it that this package spends more than 25 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, on items that kill millions of jobs?
Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

Several recent reversals on those issues illustrate the difficulty Trump could face over the next 19 months as he attempts to bridge the gap between his fiery rhetoric and more complicated reality.
While 35 cases may not seem like much compared to the total number of people using e-cigarettes, we are nonetheless concerned by these reported cases, Gottlieb and the FDA's Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy said in a statement. We want to be clear that we don't yet know if there's a direct relationship between the use of e-cigarettes and a risk of seizure. We can't yet say for certain that e-cigarettes are causing these seizures.
Gorsuch said in a speech last spring that as a judge he had tried to follow Scalia's path.
President Trump will meet with his national security adviser, the vice president and the Ukrainian president in the morning and then attend a legislative affairs lunch. He will later dine with the first lady and the Pences at the Naval Observatory.
-- White House domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller, a former aide to Sessions when he was in the Senate, got heckled as he ate dinner at Espita Mezcaleria in the D.C. neighborhood of Shaw on Sunday. The New York Post's Nikki Schwab reports: 'Hey look guys, whoever thought we'd be in a restaurant with a real-life fascist begging [for] money for new cages?' a customer at the Mezcal joint snarled at Miller, according to a source who saw the encounter. Miller didn't respond and scurried away, the witness said. (Yahoo News's Lisa Belkin reports that Miller's great-grandfather flunked his U.S. naturalization test.)
The tweet directed at the Freedom Caucus was a reminder that nothing goes without notice, said one Trump associate with direct knowledge of White House strategy.

— A few more good reads from The Post and beyond:
Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), a moderate Republican who has voted against multiple bills dismantling the ACA, said Tuesday she was very disappointed in the administration's legal position.
TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They're chopping off heads. They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They're drowning people in steel cages. And he -- now we're talking about waterboarding.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) predicted before Tuesday's lunch that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) would vote against the bill and leave Republicans with only one more no vote to spare. Paul spokesman Sergio Gor responded afterward that Graham should not be speaking for his boss, who remains optimistic the bill can be improved.
Here's a roundup of some of his false and misleading claims.
-- The Congressional Review Act had only been used once since it passed in 1996 to get rid of a regulation.
Make Mexico reimburse the United States for the full cost of the border wall. In a phone conversation with Mexico's president on Jan. 27, 2017, a transcript of which was provided to The Washington Post and published Aug. 3, Trump indicated that he would not fulfill this promise but would not say so publicly, because it would hurt him politically. He pressed his Mexican counterpart to not raise the issue or suggest that he would not pursue his promise. You cannot say that to the press, Trump said, according to the transcript. The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. Since that conversation, Trump has rarely raised the issue and made no move to force compliance by Mexico. Instead, he has seized billions of dollars from previously approved military construction projects and redirected the money to fund his border barrier. At a campaign rally on Tuesday, Trump asserted that Mexico's paying for the wall, you know that, you will see that, but this remains one of his biggest broken promises.
At 11:15 or so, Trump himself appeared — in person at Trump Tower, on screens everywhere else — stealing the thunder of even his own nominees, revisiting some of his favorite topics: the crooked media, the losers who didn't support him, the tax returns he hasn't released and says aren't important.
Some Sanders supporters were inclined to agree. Unfounded theories about the delay in the count and about the phone app introduced to tally the caucus results spread quickly. Sanders's base of support does have a broad distrust of the establishment, and the Iowa caucuses' sloppy execution provided plenty of fuel for that view.
Separately, the Senate parliamentarian decided Tuesday that the House legislation fits into a Senate budget rule that would allow the health-care bill to pass with a simple majority rather than having to clear a 60-vote threshold needed for most other legislation. That ruling is the first of several complicated procedural steps that must happen before the Senate can vote on a final bill.
A use it or lose it rule would apply to escrow funds that have not been used for insurance by the end of open enrollment.
Finally, on his video town hall sitting next to his wife, Jill, the former vice president spoke with families and answered questions on the coronavirus, giving them and the country an opportunity to see what sort of person he is. Introducing themselves to the children on the town hall as Pop and Nana — the names they use with their grandchildren — the Bidens projected the qualities we used to take for granted in first families. Biden's empathy for those who had lost loved ones, his calm demeanor, his quiet optimism (I'm confident we will all get through it) and his gratitude for those who serve in the military and elsewhere provided a reassuring break from the dust storms Trump throws up every time he speaks. When Biden deferred to former surgeon general Vivek Murthy (who, despite Trump's efforts to promote hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for covid-19, cautioned that scientists are studying but have not yet approved the drug for that purpose), he reminds us that a president is not necessarily the most informed on every issue. Instead, Biden knows what he does not know and knows how to find reliable expertise. A president, Biden reminded us, needs to be the calmest person in every room and must be able to console, comfort and give fellow Americans hope.
In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion? I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.

The bill calls for a transfer of Medicaid funds from states that provide more-generous benefits, such as New York and California, to those that do not. But it says the requirement to transfer funds shall not apply to any state that has a population density of less than 15 individuals per square mile, That would affect just five states: Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
Few nationally known white evangelical pastors have vocally opposed Trump, though some critics have emerged, including John Piper, a retired megachurch pastor in Minneapolis who has written of Trump's immoral behavior.
Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, announced that HHS will amend regulations to make it easier for recently retired or inactive doctors and nurses to administer coronavirus vaccines in an effort to speed distribution.
Biden has also been invoking Obama as he steps up his attacks on Steyer, the X factor in this primary.The former V.P. blasted the billionaire from San Francisco over the weekend for investing in private prisons while he and Obama were in the White House trying to get rid of private prisons.
Number two, we have to get integrated care. It's much too fragmented. I ran academic health centers. Oh, my God. You have a doctor for every part of your body, but they don't necessarily work seamlessly together. Most of our costs are in chronic care. So we have to figure out ways to manage that within the health-care system and we have to do it efficiently and effectively. We have to take on prescription drugs and we got to do it without gimmicks like importation.
Sorry, hombre, it's all coal, Trump says. In Trump's America, men work in two places: coal mines or Goldman Sachs.
It's highly unlikely, said Ellen Delena Reed, a second-term state legislator and main sponsor of the legislation. Theoretically, we could attach it to a different bill, but it's hard to do that without the blessing of leadership.
SPICER: Well, again, I mean, there's two things -- two pieces to this, Scott.
It sounds like he is attempting to make it appear as if he is pushing forward policy positions that he wants to take some credit for. He wants to be in the papers for having endorsed things he is generally in favor of, even though there's nothing really new.
OUCH: There have been 72 people sickened in a five-state E.coli outbreak, and officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they have yet to determine the source, our colleague Michael Brice-Saddler reports.
Andrew Yang: I think that the attitude you are describing, while it does apply to a certain subset of Americans, applies to a very, very low proportion of them. And I'm confident of this because when I campaign around the country, at every event I go to, someone comes up to me in the line afterwards and says, I voted for Donald Trump. This time I'm voting for you. One survey in New Hampshire said that 10 percent of the voters who voted for Trump would vote for me over Trump in the general election. Another survey said that 18 percent of college Republicans would choose me over the president. Now, this is not everyone. But this is enough. You don't need to convert 80 percent of the president's followers. You need to convert, let's call it 20 percent. So this attitude that you're describing is very real. But I believe that it does not contain 100 percent of the folks who voted for Donald Trump. And I know this because, again, they come to me at my events every single time and say, You're my candidate this time..
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) suggested a drinking game:
And then we get them out.
Of course, we should be cautious interpreting such responses. Some respondents may hide their real, unpopular views. If so, then our results may underestimate the prevalence of extreme attitudes — although the fact that our survey took place impersonally, online, reduces this concern.
Republicans said their bill will make health insurance cheaper. Except, they'll have to figure out a way to explain why, under Obamacare, 64-year-olds making $26,500 a year are on track to pay $1,700 in annual premiums in 2026. And under the GOP bill, they would pay anywhere between $13,600 to $16,100.
The political pitfalls in the race to 2020
BOOKER: The New Jersey senator is staffing up. And he hired Julie McClain, the senior director of campaign communications for Emily's List who is seven-months pregnant, as national director of state communications.
'I'm not going because of the American dream, I'm going and taking my kids because we need security, we need safety,' she said in tears, describing how she had fled a job as a scientist in a laboratory after she starting being followed and receiving phone threats. She described the new policy as pressure aimed at making people like her give up her asylum claim.
A HuffPost contributor highlighted these divisive reactions to Rep. Ilhan Omar's op-ed on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:
But one expert told Virgil they don't believe mandate repeal would have affected the latest numbers, in part because the individual mandate won't actually be eliminated until 2019. Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said it was more likely a result of marketplace defections.
The $55 billion package makes a five-year commitment to addressing shortcomings in the country's largest health system, which still struggles with delays after a 2014 scandal in which VA employees were found to have fudged patient wait lists, Lisa writes. About one-third of veterans in the system now see outside doctors through a program called Choice, but the program is fragmented and unwieldy. Doctors have complained of slow or nonexistent payments, and veterans say there's insurmountable red tape.
I was shocked when I saw them, Barr said.
At first, this was a political headache for me and my colleagues: Few elected Republicans wanted to spend much time or political capital refuting people who were part of the base. But then a small group of lawmakers in the House and the Senate, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), started telling the base what they longed to hear: that Republicans could indeed defund Obamacare simply by insisting on it as part of a larger annual government spending bill. These members, and indeed every other elected Republican, knew better, but very few were willing to say so. I had dozens of meetings with individual lawmakers, as well as group sessions, imploring my colleagues to take a different approach, because shutdowns don't work. Often, these same members would leave the meetings and go on cable TV to talk about how leadership wasn't fighting hard enough, and only they were. And the shutdown was born.
In 2012, Romney catapulted Ryan onto the national stage and brought a flood of scrutiny to his provocative positions on entitlements and fiscal policy.
But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.
The bill does not address most of the Obamacare regulations that help drive up the cost of insurance in the first place, Cotton said during a March interview in his Senate office.
Court documents point to how Trump's rhetoric incited the Capitol rioters.
KELLY: This is what the court of appeals said.
Biden's Irish heritage and family shaped his drive to succeed. My mom used to have an expression — she'd say, 'As long as you're alive, you have an obligation to strive, and you're not dead until you've seen the eyes of God.' And the truth of the matter is I think that's the Irish of it.
Hill, 31, entered the race for the longtime Republican seat north of Los Angeles in March 2017. Also a first-time candidate, she had been working for local nonprofit agencies, which included helping California's expansion of Medicaid that came through the ACA.
In a heated closed-door briefing yesterday, members of Congress confronted Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other Trump administration officials about their response to the outbreak, our Post colleagues Erica Werner and Yasmeen Abutaleb report. Senators from Hawaii complained health officials from their state didn't know in advance that their airport would need to be ready to quarantine U.S. citizens returning from China.

Trump's surrogates said Tuesday on television that abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are not impeachable offenses. It does not make any difference at the end of the day, as Professor Dershowitz explained so well yesterday, said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.), a member of Trump's impeachment defense team. Abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are not impeachable offenses, and it doesn't really matter what anybody says. CNN's Jake Tapper pushed back, noting that they were considered impeachable offenses during the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, but Johnson was unbowed.
AHH: The role of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has shifted from national security to humanitarian relief, in part because of the deaths of two Guatemalan children who crossed into the United States in December, our Post colleague Maria Sacchetti reports. After the deaths of Jakelin Caal, 7, and Felipe Gómez Alonzo, 8, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vowed extraordinary protective measures, and federal officials say medical staff presence has increased at the border.
In a Feb. 23 letter to House leaders, a group of education associations objected to this claim. We are aware of the inaccurate notion that schools are not in need of additional funding because of the reported 'spend' rate of federal funding to date, the letter said. In conversations with our respective memberships, they report that while the 'spend rate' may seem quite low to those unfamiliar with state and district school financial procedures and requirements, they have budgeted for every dollar they are scheduled to receive from the COVID relief bills and are still anticipating more significant costs they will be unable to meet without additional federal funds.
Former vide president Joe Biden's slip of the tongue hints at 2020 presidential run:

During the campaign, Trump went well out of his way to telegraph that he isn't an ideological fellow traveler with other Republicans when it comes to government's role in expanding health care to the poor. Now advisers such as Bannon are coming face to face with the harsh ideological and mathematical realities of the GOP repeal-and-place push and are apparently asking themselves whether going along with it — which would make Trump the guy who kicks millions off coverage — will undercut his aura of ideological heterodoxy on economic matters. It is likely one group of voters they're worried about is the low-income whites who populate Trump's base.
The sergeant at arms will deliver the proclamation.
The Sanders agenda won't sell there, and elected Democrats running for their political lives in these critical states and districts will sprint from a set of plans that costs between $60 trillion (the cautious estimate) and $97 trillion (the estimate Republicans will use) over the next decade. These Democrats will balk at an agenda that doubles the size of government. They will say no to the middle-class tax increases already being proposed by Sanders and the massive deficits he could create because his tax plans cover only a sliver of his costs.
In all, only about 2,160 people, or 0.5% of study participants, received notifications of irregular heart rhythms. The rate was higher in people 65 and older — 3.2%, versus 0.16% in people ages 22 to 39, Peter reports. Of those notified by the watch, only about 450 people received and returned the wearable ECG patches to the researchers … Researchers found that the ECG patches confirmed atrial fibrillation in only 34% of the 450 people who returned patches. The remaining two-thirds had no confirmed atrial fibrillation during the time they wore the patches — raising questions about the watch's accuracy.
Speaking of Warren, the founders also didn't imagine women voting — let alone running for president. The 19th Amendment didn't guarantee suffrage until 1920.
TRUMP: It's a minor civil case.
HOT ON THE LEFT: House committee passes Amendment 4 bill along party lines, from the Tampa Bay Times: A Florida House committee approved a bill addressing the rollout of Amendment 4 despite concerns that it would limit the number of former felons who could have their voting rights restored. Voting along party lines, Republicans advanced the measure, which would require felons pay back all court fees and costs before being eligible to vote, even if those costs are not handed down by a judge as part of the person's sentence. That standard goes beyond the old system, which only required someone pay back restitution to a victim before applying to have their civil rights restored. And Democratic representatives and others blasted it. 'It's blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax,' said Rep. Adam Hattersley, D-Riverview. HOT ON THE RIGHT: Gun-toting GOP candidate vows to back Trump in first ad of US House special election, from the Raleigh News & Observer: One of 17 candidates vying for the Republican nomination in North Carolina's 3rd Congressional District special election will begin airing television ads in the Greenville market … In the ad, Eric Rouse, a Lenoir County commissioner, is seen skeet shooting — hitting clays with Democratic priorities like the Green New Deal written on them in the 30-second ad. It closes with Rouse cocking a gun and vowing to have [Trump's] back if elected. Rouse is among 26 candidates running to replace Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who died on Feb. 10.

The White House task force is trying to speed things up with a new initiative to get vaccine doses to the most vulnerable seniors.
That gives Democrats the chance to move forward confidently with their agenda, an agenda that is enormously popular. Yet some in the party are still in the grip of the nonsensical belief that it's more important to retain a Senate procedure whose purpose is to thwart progress than to pass laws that solve problems.
Given VA's systemic problems with providing timely, quality care, there's a raging political debate over whether its 20 million veterans should be able to visit private providers instead. And the recent ouster of VA chief David Shulkin is further inflaming the controversy.

The states defending the ACA are appealing a December ruling by a federal appeals court that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional. The appeals court kicked the case back to a lower federal court, but the states are eager for a final ruling from SCOTUS.
The Food and Drug Administration will start accepting new drug and medical device applications, now that the agency can resume collecting new user fees to pay for the applications. But officials warn it could take up to a year to finally catch up with backlogged work, our colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
The push comes as January's unemployment rate is worse than we thought: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said Wednesday that the unemployment rate in January was 'close to 10 percent,' significantly higher than the 6.3 percent rate reported by the Labor Department last week, our colleague Rachel Siegel reports.
In December, a divided panel of the 5th Circuit agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but sent the case back to O'Connor for a more rigorous examination of whether parts of the law should remain in place.
Obamacare has proven to be a disaster with fewer options, inferior care, and skyrocketing costs that are crushing small businesses and families across America, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. Today marks an important step toward restoring health care choices and affordability back to the American people. President Trump looks forward to working with both Chambers of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.
• Retired U.S. general: Putin is 'happiest guy on the planet' after Trump's comments, the caption beneath MSNBC's talking heads declares a moment or two later.
Andrew Yang: There has been excessive consolidation in the technology industry, and it's bad for us on many levels. We should be forcing some of these technology companies to divest parts of themselves. We should also be prohibiting them from acquiring certain types of businesses, because right now in Silicon Valley, the business model is not to build the next great company. The business model is to get gobbled up by one of the behemoths for a billion dollars and then everyone's rich and goes home, and it doesn't really matter what they did to your technology. That said, breaking up Amazon, as an example, would not magically revive the main streets of Indiana. And there are many fields in technology where there will actually be one or maybe two winners. And the example I used at one of the debates was, no one wants to use Bing today or no one wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. We all just want to use the one that has the best information on it. And so saying we're going to keep breaking you up anytime one of you wins does not make sense in some of these contexts.
Going around, or above, or below the White House press corps is a time-honored White House practice.
GOP leadership aides said they were confident the measure would pass Friday, but the vote could still be close — reflecting significant tactical differences on an issue that Republicans have long touted as a chief priority should their party regain the White House.

TRUMP: Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.
I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, take 'yes' for an answer, Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) said. We agree with you. This reform is good; this reform will stay as the law of the land.
The Biden communications team will soon likely face two more high-profile tests: A probable address to Congress late this month, and a drive to convince Americans wary of the coronavirus vaccine that they should set aside their skepticism.
So what's going on? The drop could reflect the repeal of the law's individual mandate to buy coverage, reporter Virgil Dickson writes. The new figure comes weeks after President Donald Trump signed a Republican-backed tax bill that repealed the individual mandate. Insurance companies stated repeatedly last year that not enforcing or eliminating the mandate would cause insurance companies to exit the federal and state exchanges, Virgil writes.
In November, 53 percent of voters approved Proposition 3, a measure set to take effect in April, to expand the program and increase a state sales tax to generate about $90 million to help fund the care to 150,000 low-income residents, with the help of $800 million in federal funding, the Salt Lake Tribune's Benjamin Wood reports. But Cox acknowledged that may not be sufficient. It's very clear that tax increase [in Prop 3] is not going to cover the entire amount of the expansion, he said.
The subsidy expansions that he proposed embroider on an idea he first broached in an article he wrote about the law that was published in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The president also renewed his urging for additional states to join the 31 that have expanded Medicaid as the ACA allows. And he reiterated a position he has adopted this year that consumers would be helped if the government allowed a public insurance alternative in parts of the country that lack enough private companies selling ACA health plans to create market competition.
His success isn't going to be measured just by how well the economy comes back, if it comes back, he told the Syracuse newspaper that year. But this country has survived because of its differences, not in spite of them. It's important to listen and to show respect.
-- New York Times A1 --> Picking themselves up after the bruising collapse of their health care plan, [Trump and GOP lawmakers] will start this week on a legislative obstacle course that will be even more arduous: the first overhaul of the tax code in three decades. Alan Rappeport reports: Mr. Trump's inability to make good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act has made the already daunting challenge of tax reform even more difficult. Not only has Mr. Trump's aura of political invincibility been shattered, but without killing the Affordable Care Act, Republicans will be unable to rewrite the tax code in the sweeping fashion that the president has called for. The grand plans of lower rates, fewer loopholes and a tax on imports may have to be scaled back to a big corporate tax cut and possibly an individual tax cut. If Republicans intend to act again without the help of Democrats, they will need to use a procedure called budget reconciliation to have the Senate pass tax legislation with a simple majority. Eliminating the $1 trillion of Affordable Care Act taxes and the federal spending associated with that law would have made this easier. Because they failed, Republicans will struggle to reach their goal of cutting corporate tax rates without piling on debt. [And] under pressure to get something done, some Republican deficit hawks appear ready to abandon the fiscal rectitude that they embraced during the Obama administration to help salvage Mr. Trump's agenda.
An amendment to the bill would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. The latest addition, which would provide $8 billion over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions, swayed some concerned moderate Republican lawmakers to support the bill, allowing the House GOP leadership to secure enough votes to pass it.
President Trump's relationship with his former personal physician Harold Bornstein began to sour more than a year ago. Here's what you need to know. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post)
The death rate per 100,000 people from drug overdoses declined for the first time since 2012 and the raw number of deaths fell for the first time since 1990 — from 70,237 in 2017 to 67,367 in 2018. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called the news a real victory and said it shows the administration's focus on opioid addiction is paying off.
Those years set up the trajectory for health into adulthood, said Olanrewaju Falusi, an assistant director at the Children's National Hospital in the District, and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. This is very alarming to me, to say that young children are becoming uninsured at a higher rate.
The lesson here is don't try to pass a bill that only 17 percent of the country approves of — that's a problem, he on MSNBC Monday. When no one likes the legislation, you have to do it different.
Ryan is retiring at the end of the year, and whatever tenuous grip he had on unruly House Republicans over the past three years appears to be slipping as his lame-duck status settles in. After he announced his retirement in April, he had to withstand grumbles from his own party that he was staying on until after the November midterm elections.
House action is expected to come barely 24 hours after Senate passage of the measure. Only one senator, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), crossed party lines — arguing, in part, that the GOP should put forth an Obamacare replacement first.
A few hours later, the president weighed in to insist that there actually was a message. He said his wife's jacket refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!
AHH: Trump is interviewing former congressman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) this week to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, Reuters reports. Miller, who works as a lobbyist for McDermott Will & Emery, served in Congress from 2001 to 2017 and chaired the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.

About 16,800 plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against J&J in U.S. state and federal courts alleging the company's talcum powders caused ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, and J&J failed to properly warn consumers of this risk, the Journal writes.
In a news release last week, the company announced its vaccine was 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness in a global clinical trial. It offered the best protection against severe cases of disease, proving 85 percent effective. There were no hospitalizations or deaths among people who received the vaccine, Carolyn and Laurie write. That result held up even in the South Africa portion of its trial, where a concerning virus variant that has shown the ability to evade some immunity has become dominant.
The White House press office provides credentials to reporters. The White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists, assembles the pool, so it was responsible for putting Lucas in the rotation.
Key excerpt: An overweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied about his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he personally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject. The details of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would begin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. . . . Prior to his presidency, he had likely never had a meaningful discussion in his life about health insurance.
After Trump takes office, Romney offers him his support, saying in a February interview that what people recognize is that he's doing what he said he'd do. I'm sure that's very encouraging to a lot of people. I think all of us, whether we are for him or someone else, have high hopes for our president.

Dubbed the Caring for Our Veterans Act, the bill eliminates requirements that veterans must have waited longer than 30 days for an appointment or live farther than 40 miles from a VA facility to seek private care. Instead, it opens that door directly if veterans and their providers decide together that community care is the best option.
First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right. He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money. Now he's trying to do the same in exchange for their country. This is a fact. He talks about these great businesses that he's built. He inherited over $100 million.
The Congress can't get cold feet because the people will not let that happen, Trump said during the interview with The Post.
-- Driving the week: The Congressional Budget Office's estimate of how much the bill will cost and how many will lose coverage is scheduled to land as early as today. Everyone knows that its report will predict that millions of people would no longer have insurance.

The role of opioids for treating chronic pain has long been a contested issue. Last week, the FDA called on drug companies to examine whether opioids are effectively treating chronic pain and the National Institutes of Health is studying the issue as part of its Helping to End Addiction Longterm Intiative, Lenny writes.
Another option is to purchase insurance through the ACA marketplaces. Insurance marketplaces have only one annual open enrollment period for new customers. Luckily, those who previously had insurance that met the ACA's requirements fall into an exception and can buy insurance on the marketplaces now, although there is substantial paperwork. But everyone else — those who didn't have insurance before or who had the kind of skimpy plan that does not comply with the law but that President Trump has promoted — desperately need an administrative fix. They need a new special enrollment period to allow people onto the rolls. Otherwise, they cannot get insurance coverage until 2021, unless their incomes fall low enough for Medicaid.
There is no question that pharmaceutical companies — and partnerships between them and our government — play a critical role in developing lifesaving medications for Virginians and Americans, including critical coronavirus vaccines. But there is also no question that for decades, this industry has been ripe with unnecessary middlemen, rampant profiteering and secret backdoor deals, and that these corporations' bottom line comes first.
During his State of the Union address, the president said he would call for the increase in funding as part of his budget. But allotting an extra $500 million over the next decade pales in comparison to the National Cancer Institute's nearly $6 billion annual budget — or even the Obama administration's cancer moonshot, which resulted in Congress approving $1.8 billion over seven years to finding a cure, Adam writes.

Cruz talks a lot and fights a lot but has not done a lot. He is an impatient young man with little to show for it. He could stay in the Senate and become a legislative dynamo or he could leave to start a business, head a foundation or run a city. Being responsible for accomplishing something concrete could be an eye-opening experience. Alternatively, a state supreme court appointment might launch him on a career doing what he loves, pondering and debating the law and without the need for glad-handing, for which he is ill-suited.
So, from Trump's perspective: You get rid of the filibuster, you get rid of the need for 60 votes, and it becomes much easier for Republicans to pass his agenda with just 50 or 51 votes. Sounds simple enough.
Providence, which operates 51 hospitals and more than 800 clinics across seven states, offers several virtual care programs including telepsychiatry, teleneurology and telehospitalist, focused on general care for hospitalized patients. The hospital network is expanding its virtual services for stroke patients, now that the condition is exempted from the geographical restriction on reimbursement. Compton-Phillips said the hospital network is anticipating 8,000 virtual stroke consultations this year, up from 1,400 in 2016.
But this appears to be a self-selected survey, not a random sample. This was an online survey of Texas State Teachers Association teacher members. We have about 50,000 teacher members, and we encouraged them by email to participate in the survey, said Clay Robison, a TSTA spokesman. Some 974 teachers participated.
Several Republicans said they're discussing the possibility of adopting a budget this year that would let the next president's agenda — including top goals like repealing Obamacare — bypass a Democratic filibuster at the very start of the year. Republicans used a similar move early this year to send a bill repealing much of Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who vetoed it.
White House officials are also weighing an Obamacare replacement that Congress would take up after the election, a Medicare plan to contrast with Democratic Medicare-for-all proposals, help for beleaguered rural hospitals and steps to reduce maternal death rates, according to two senior administration officials.
With this in mind, we are closely eyeing the power of superdelegates: 771 former presidents, vice presidents, current members of Congress, members of the Democratic National Committee and other party bigwigs who vote at the Democratic National Convention. These officials are officially known as automatic delegates and their votes are not tied to specific primary and caucus results.
-- The New Yorker, Is Trump trolling the White House press corps? by Andrew Marantz: Until recently, the more established White House correspondents have regarded floaters as a harmless distraction—the equivalent of letting a batboy sit in the dugout. Now they are starting to see the floaters as an existential threat. 'Historically, the way the briefing room has been organized is, the closer you are, the farther you've come, said [CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett]. 'And the person at the podium has tended to recognize that.' More experienced reporters, he said, 'ask questions that are sharper, more informed. Not, 'What's your message today?' Not, 'Here's a paintbrush—would you paint us a pretty picture?'' If established reporters got fewer questions relative to the floaters, I asked, would this be good or bad for democracy? 'We'll see,' Garrett said. 'We're engaged in a grand experiment.'

-- House Democrats may not vote this week, after all, on a war powers resolution after Iran's attack on U.S. assets. Politico reports that the prospect of intensifying conflict in the region, and the unwillingness of Republicans to break with the president, complicates the timing: House Democrats say they are likely to pause, if not abandon, their plans for a war powers resolution. … In a private meeting, some Democrats pushed to add a measure from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) that would defund any U.S. military action against Iran without first receiving congressional approval … Moderate Democrats had their own reservations about the whole exercise, and are unwilling to draft a resolution that would hamstring the military in its response to future attacks. … Some progressives, meanwhile, were looking to go even further. Two lawmakers, [Rep. Barbara] Lee [D-Calif.] and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), had been pushing their own version of a war powers resolution over the weekend.
The Trump administration, determined to overhaul and modernize the nation's infrastructure, is drafting plans to privatize some public assets such as airports, bridges, highway rest stops and other facilities, according to top officials and advisers … two driving themes are clear: Government practices are stalling the nation's progress; and private companies should fund, build and run more of the basic infrastructure of American life.

You also have to meet certain wage and job duration benchmarks; you basically have to prove you were doing meaningful work before you became unemployed. Those requirements vary by state, but generally require having worked consecutive quarters and collecting a paycheck for a certain amount of time during those quarters.
But virtually everyone who paid any attention to public affairs was aware of our challenge to Obamacare. Had it been invalidated and the decision remanded to the now-divided Congress to devise a new and perhaps even genuine reform of the existing regulations of health insurance, it would have shown the American people that there were indeed limits on the power of Congress.
Barr said of the proposal, That sounds like a very common-sensical bill and something that I would . . . be inclined to support, adding that broader immigration laws were in need of reform.

-- Directly contradicting his earlier statements, Attorney General Jeff Sessions insisted during an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network that the administration never really intended to separate any families. It hasn't been good and the American people don't like the idea that we are separating families. We never really intended to do that, said Sessions, who championed the policy internally and announced it publicly. What we intended to do was to make sure that adults who bring children into the country are charged with the crime they have committed. Earlier this month, Sessions was unapologetic during an interview with Hugh Hewitt. Every time somebody gets prosecuted in America for a crime, American citizens, and they go to jail, they're separated from their children. We don't want to do this at all. If people don't want to be separated from their children, they should not bring them with them. (CNN)
Marianne Williamson, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this month, said her appearance with Andrew Yang in Iowa does not constitute an endorsement:
If I were over 70 or otherwise ill, I would certainly take the vaccine even if I'd had [covid-19]. If I were 30 and healthy, I should not be getting it now (unless a health care worker), but if for some reason I did get offered it I would probably decline, Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease specialist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in an email.
Rosenstein can and surely will make the Mueller report public. It's inconceivable that he'd try to stifle it, whatever its conclusions might be, Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe tweeted.
In recent years, the number of women enrolling in accredited law schools has exceeded the number of men … But women make up less than a quarter of law firm equity partners, a quarter of tenured and tenure-track law professors, and about a third of all active federal district and appeals court judges. … Women are also underrepresented at oral argument at the high court. In the past five terms, 17 percent of the advocates were women … 'There is certainly more glass yet to be shattered,' Duke Law professor Marin Levy told the crowd after ticking off the statistics. 'But I see a whole lot of hammers out there.'
It seems this is more motivated by political and regulatory uncertainty, and it could be a sign that Anthem would exit nationally, said Cynthia Cox, associate director for the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. If that is the case, that could leave hundreds of thousands of people without any insurer option. This could be the tip of the iceberg.
This is just not true. Indeed, in this case passing a relief bill that actually improves people's lives, helping the pandemic and the economic crisis end more quickly, will give Biden and Democrats more ability to pass other items on their agenda.
As part of Barr's pledge to support criminal justice reform, he called on the administration's diplomatic force to do a better job getting foreign governments to stop the inflow of drug shipments from overseas.
After casting her vote in Mt. Lebanon, a suburb of Pittsburgh, dental hygienist Janet Dellana said she had been outraged to see Trump call for arming teachers instead of limiting access to semiautomatic weapons after the deadly school shooting in Florida.
If Democrats do not have the House and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, what changes in the existing health-care system would you seek to make? How do you entice Republicans to accept an expansion of guaranteed health care?
It was a return for Trump to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he uses the media — and his supporters' distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn't just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn't), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked.
Conspiracy theorists claim the U.S. is to blame for the virus. China is happy to encourage them. In recent days, run-of-the-mill mockery of the White House has taken a darker turn as the Chinese Internet became inundated by the theory, subtly stoked by the Chinese government, that the coronavirus originated in the United States. The U.S. government, one version of the theory goes, has been covering up mounting cases, and perhaps thousands of deaths, by classifying them as regular flu, Gerry Shih reports.
Americans have gotten used to Big Government while paying only for smaller government. One reason that this has — so far — worked is that the dollar is the world's major currency for international trade, investment and personal saving. People take refuge in it. Lending and borrowing in dollars create a global demand for the currency. It's easy for our government to borrow at low interest rates.
AHH: States are preparing for a flood of vaccine doses.
The special election was also seen as a referendum on President Trump — the latest in a string of special election losses for Democrats, a fact that Trump himself pointed out on Twitter after the race was called Tuesday night:
The first week after I announced, it was difficult, Gottlieb said. I was very emotional because in some respects, I'm walking away from the best job I'll ever have. That's hard to do.
Over 80 percent of hospitals would immediately be put into negative margins, Blahous said in an email, citing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's Office of the Actuary.
Neal pointed out that the health-insurance proposal comes in tandem with the first action the Biden White House has taken to broaden access to coverage, including for the millions of Americans who have lost health benefits as their jobs were swept away by the pandemic's economic ripple effects. Two weeks ago, the president ordered the reopening of the ACA's federal insurance marketplaces for three months to give people who need coverage during the pandemic an extra chance to buy health plans.
Carolyn notes the rates aren't final. The rate requests are an early sign of the trends in the individual marketplace, but they are only the first step toward determining 2019 premiums, which will be subject to review, she writes.
The White House has an explanation for Trump's reversal on Medicaid. Asked by John Harwood to explain the flip, budget director Mick Mulvaney claimed the promise was supplanted by Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. This is nonsense: As Brian Beutler explains, Mulvaney layered a lie of his own on top of Trump's, because Trump's budget cuts to Medicaid go hundreds of billions of dollars beyond phasing out Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) invoked a 1995 article Barr wrote for the Catholic Lawyer in which he decried laws that seek to ratify, or put on an equal plane, conduct that previously was considered immoral. As an example of that, Barr had pointed in the article to a D.C. law forcing Georgetown University — a religious institution — to treat homosexual activist groups like any other student group. Booker asked Barr whether his opinion had changed.
The National Border Patrol Council lauded his nomination, saying, quote, Stellar credentials. General Kelly's troops by all accounts loved him, which bodes well for the morale within the DHS and he appears to be a no-nonsense rule of law general, end quote.
The penalty for not having health coverage is $695 per adult and $347.50 per child — up to $2,085 per family — or 2.5 percent of family income, whichever is greater. About 6.5 million taxpayers paid a fine for being uninsured in 2015, according to the IRS, although the fine that year was $470 per adult.

-- Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, raised a remarkable $6.7 million last quarter. The Texas Tribune's Patrick Svitek reports: Cruz has not released his first-quarter fundraising numbers yet, but O'Rourke's $6.7 million total is on a different level than his previous hauls, which ranged from $1.7 million to $2.4 million. Those alone were good enough to outraise Cruz for three of the last four reporting periods. Furthermore, the $6.7 million total came from more than 141,000 contributions — another record-busting number for O'Rourke. … O'Rourke said about 70 percent of his first-quarter haul was raised within Texas and that the average donation was 'a little over $40.'
The Pelosi aide, Wendell Primus, met with Blue Cross Blue Shield executives and outlined five concerns party leadership had with Medicare-for-all, the Intercept's Ryan Grim reports, citing sources familiar with the meeting. Their objections centered around cost, stakeholder opposition and implementation issues. Primus assured the executives in the early December meeting that they would help the insurance industry bat down efforts for a single-payer health care plan, and insisted the party was more focused on tackling high drug prices, Ryan reports.
This will be a thoughtful, step-by-step process, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday. We're not going to swap one 2,700-page monstrosity for another. . . . We're going to do this the right way.
Trump, in the interview, said experts who said this would violate international law were fools. But there are practical problems, too. In 2015, Iraq produced about 4 million barrels a day, enough crude oil to fill more than 700 Trump Towers. Securing all of the oil, including in northern Iraq where the Islamic State exists, would require a military force larger than the one that invaded Iraq in 2003.
Conversely, some individuals may show team loyalty even if they don't truly wish anyone physical harm. Even then, expressive hostility — which appears frequently online — is itself a troubling indicator of extreme political incivility.
The Post account relies on nine officials with knowledge of the situation, and adds that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn's communications with Kislyak, so this story will continue.
Today's announcement from Anthem is further proof that the markets are collapsing and Obamacare is broken, Virginia House of Delegates Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said in a statement. Obamacare is hurting more people than it is helping. … Now is the time for Congress to come together and figure out a solution that gives much needed relief to hard-working families. If Congress continues to kick the can down the road, it will only exacerbate the problems we currently face.
The federal mandate requiring people to have insurance will end in 2019.
Trump argues the Democrats are not negotiating in good faith. But the president has had many, many opportunities over the last two years to make a deal with Congress. Instead, he kept moving the goal post, shifting positions and trying to satisfy his base.
The rule is very clear cut, Kamarck told us. It says delegates shall — 'in all good conscious' — vote for the person they were elected to represent. Which means that the presumption is that if you're elected to be a Sanders delegate you're going to come into the convention and vote for [Sanders]. But there is a loophole in that — over a five-month contest, things change.
On Wednesday morning, the campaign to radically change New Hampshire's primary with ranked-choice voting was throttled in a small committee room near the state capitol. A bill that would have introduced the system by early 2020 — allowing Democrats to rank their favorite candidates, with ballots added up until one candidate has a majority — was quickly debated and tabled.
The traditional liberal response to the Federalist Society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. The conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the Constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. Those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the Constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.
A final reason to hope: Actions speak louder than words. Four years ago, Mr. Trump repaired from the Capitol to the White House to sign an executive order curtailing Obamacare and, a week later, issued his notorious ban on Syrian refugees as well as travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Biden spent his first day undoing those orders and others, while directing his administration to extend pandemic-crisis protections for renters and student borrowers.
Early on, she planned to study pre-med, but moved toward finance instead. She is married to Mezvinsky, the son of former Iowa Rep. Edward Mezvinsky and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a former member of Congress from Pennsylvania.
OUCH: According to the Trump administration, there's been a massive drop in the number of health plans available in the individual and small-group insurance markets: There are now just 700 plans, down from 2,400 previously, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a notice this week. The new data would reflect a 70 percent decrease, Modern Healthcare reports.
Given the size and the number of states that are involved, what you're seeing is very unusual, Marler told Michael. If it was five people or 10 people, that's a little harder to figure out. But when there's 72 people and they're being interviewed by epidemiologists, it's pretty unusual you don't have a culprit.
-- The House's lawyers filed a motion with an appeals court last night that says Trump's defense lawyers have contradicted, and therefore undermined, the Department of Justice's position on subpoenas. Ann Marimow reports: The lawyers for [Pelosi] asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to rule quickly on the pair of separation-of-powers cases, which they said could affect the Senate proceedings. House Democrats went to court seeking testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and access to secret grand jury evidence from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation. Justice Department attorneys have urged the appeals court to stay out of what they say are political disputes between Congress and the White House. But the president's team is now telling the Senate that these are matters more properly left to the courts.
May 1. Defending a House repeal-and-replace bill in an interview with Bloomberg News, Trump insists: Yeah, we're having preexisting conditions. That's it. … We are protecting preexisting conditions. And it'll be every … bit as good on preexisting conditions as Obamacare.
-- 7 sailors died aboard the USS Fitzgerald. Here are their stories, by Avi Selk: The grief swelled after divers found seven bodies in the wreckage of the USS Fitzgerald off the coast of Japan this weekend. It washed across the United States, through dire phone calls, texts and solemn visits. It reached the family of a 19-year-old firefighter who had enlisted in the Navy the year before, and the wife of a 19-year veteran who had been planning his retirement, and fell upon households from Connecticut to the southern end of Texas — people with little more in common than a sudden, immense loss on the other side of the world.
They've become a facet of almost every news broadcast, as familiar as the anchor sitting behind a desk. Within moments of the start of a newscast or panel discussion, the info-billboards on the lower third of the TV screen begin their silent unfurling:
Vice President Pence, Karen Pence, Ivanka Trump, senior adviser Jared Kushner, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway were among the administration officials at the event, our colleague Mary Jordan reports. And President Trump, who sat in the front row during Melania's speech, embraced his wife and praised her during the event.

A South Dakota judge ruled against a voter-approved constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
-- Regional radio hosts across the country have found themselves showered with attention by senior Trump officials, who have made accessibility to local conservative talking heads a central part of the president's reelection strategy. Sarah Ellison reports: Pouring attention on regional talk-radio hosts is a classic Trumpworld move: giving relatively unknown characters proximity to the White House has paid off with a disproportionate amount of attention and praise lavished on the president and his agenda. … The strategy has been particularly powerful as Trump and his team have engaged in what [Steve] Bannon calls 'information warfare' over the impeachment fight...
It took the federal government more time to build a website than it took from the time Pearl Harbor was attacked to when Germany surrendered in World War II, a narrator said in a CVA ad. Government-run health care doesn't work.
Trump: By the way, and for that, we've ended across state lines. So we have competition. You know for that I'm allowed to [inaudible] state lines. So that's all done.
We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.
The rigidly disciplined Republican senator has served in the upper chamber since 1985. He became majority leader in 2015.
In a 2015 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 70 percent opposed Ryan's proposals for Medicare.
Leslie Porras, a spokeswoman for Anthem, said in an email that the company remains in active dialogue with states and regulators.
Andrew Yang: Well, so before I decided to run for president, I spent seven years running a national nonprofit that I founded called Venture for America. And we did a lot of good, still doing a lot of good today. The organization has grown and prospered after I stepped down. But I saw the limits of what's happening in both government and philanthropy in many respects. It's why the flagship proposal of my campaign is to put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult. This would improve graduation rates, health and nutrition, mental health and stress levels, rates of business formation, domestic violence rates. It would decrease hospital visits. Because if you put the resources into the hands of a nonprofit like myself, and I'm very, very proud of all the work that we've done, you have the feeling that you're still just scratching the surface of the problem you're trying to address. Where my organization has helped create about 3,500 jobs and counting over the last number of years. We were honored by the Obama administration multiple times. And I've been to those communities now for seven years. And I've recognized that my work was like pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. The rate of change right now in our society is faster than ever. Technology is transforming our way of life fundamentally.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
Although NIH officials say the policy is not new, people who work at the Bethesda, Md. campus said they had never heard of it until the past few weeks. Officials said they posted a sign recently saying visitors needed to disclose citizenship.

Yes, up to a point, a tax and transfer system that modestly redistributes income to those who most need it can be consistent with good public finance. But if those modest efforts fail to achieve a level of income inequality that we find morally acceptable, then the right way to deal with that is to change the rules and norms of the marketplace that generate such uneven outcomes — adjusting labor, antitrust and patent laws and the rules of corporation governance. It is possible to achieve both a fairer and an equally dynamic economy without having to resort to tax rates above 50 percent.
The White House announced the 12 members of its covid-19 Health Equity Task Force. The group is charged with analyzing inequities in the nation's coronavirus response and issuing recommendations to inform the Biden administration, Akilah Johnson and William Wan report. The task force will be chaired by Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine. It also includes James Hildreth, the president of Meharry Medical College, a historically Black medical school; Andrew Imparato, a disability rights lawyer and executive director of Disability Rights California; and Vincent Toranzo, a high school student activist from Florida.
Watch President Trump and his family celebrate New Year's Eve at Mar-a-Lago:
Shortly after that, moderate House Republicans started a petition, over Ryan's objections, to force the House to vote on a series of immigration bills. GOP lawmakers — 20 of them — have signed onto the petition even as Ryan and his leadership team warn that the path they're going down could jeopardize the House Republican majority.
He is not particularly optimistic that the Republican plan to replace the 2010 law will be much better for him and his family. Until the raw costs of health care are brought down through regulation, he does not think anything will make coverage more affordable. Unless, of course, members of Congress are required to use the insurance exchanges themselves.
Clinton — to his later regret — refused to give serious consideration to a compromise offered by Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) and a bipartisan group of 20 senators. It would have gotten to the same goal by putting the responsibility for those who were not covered at work to buy insurance themselves. This individual mandate later became an integral part of Obamacare.

Republicans wanted to give every American a new tax credit to help them pay for health care or health insurance — while refusing to curtail the current subsidy, the tax exclusion for employer-provided health benefits.
April Reign, the activist who created the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite in 2015, talked to The Post about attending the awards show this year:
Here are the issues Congress will most likely deal with, ranked.
By giving herself bonus points for voting her conscience while attempting to write off most of the black voters who vote theirs, Owens is exempting herself from the hard work of trying to persuade people, black or otherwise, that the policies she favors are the right course for the black community and the country.
And indeed, polling suggests even repeal advocates are worried about losing these things. In its November poll, the Kaiser Family Foundation found support for full repeal had declined to 26 percent overall — the lowest in two years. What's more, once you noted to repeal supporters that this could end coverage for preexisting conditions, 38 percent of them changed their minds. And when it was explained that 20 million people could lose their coverage, 19 percent changed their minds.

The generic medication has been recalled by drug companies over the past seven months, our Post colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. The FDA announced the contaminant in the drugs was a chemical byproduct of the process used to synthesize the active ingredient in the drugs, which include valsartan, losartan and irbesartan, Carolyn writes. Patients who took the medication may have been exposed to trace amounts of the carcinogen for at least four years, after a shift in how the drug's active ingredient was manufactured.

In addition to the ability to sell insurance across state lines, Cruz said he would advocate for the bill to allow people to pay health insurance premiums out of health-savings accounts.
Democrats have demanded additional help for hospital workers and other concessions alongside increasing small business lending. Republicans have resisted, although on Friday they suggested a willingness to trade for more SBA funding.
It is not clear that Warren would immediately — or ever — back Sanders, Annie and Sean report. She stayed on the sidelines during the 2016 Democratic primary … eventually throwing her support to Clinton and hoping to be selected as her running mate. Warren also met with Biden in 2015 as he was considering a presidential bid of his own. At the time Biden floated the idea that they could join forces on the same ticket, but soon he decided not to challenge Clinton.
OUCH: For the first time in history, Americans are more likely to die from an opioid overdose than from a car crash, researchers found in a new report on preventable deaths from the National Safety Council.
As of December 2020, fourteen states had not expanded Medicaid eligibility. If they had done so earlier, 4.4 million fewer people would have been uninsured this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to an analysis from the Urban Institute
A health-care industry coalition called Partnership for America's Health Care Future, which is deeply wary of Medicare-for-all legislation proposed by far-left Democrats, is applauding Pelosi's focus on improving the ACA instead of overhauling the entire health-care system.

OUCH: Larry Nassar, the disgraced former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics team physician, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison yesterday after more than 150 women testified about sexual abuse they suffered at his hands for decades. For seven days in the courtroom, women and their families described Nassar's sexual abuse. In a letter to the court, Nassar maintained that touching patients was part of his medical therapy, our colleague Will Hobson reported. As parts of the letter were read, there were gasps in the room.
Lawmakers are nearing a deal for funding: Congress is closing in on a $7.5 billion package to combat coronavirus, our colleagues report, citing two people familiar with negotiations. The current number dwarfs the $1.5 billion proposal the White House initially put on the table last week.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an influential member of the Budget and Appropriations committees, said that while CBO models are not precise indicators of a bill's actual fiscal impact, the new estimate should remind Republicans that they should err on the side of being cautious, rather than make grandiose claims.
On Sunday, Pelosi issued a statement saying she spoke with the House sergeant-at-arms to ensure that U.S. Capitol Police would keep Omar safe amid new death threats following Trump's attacks and Saturday conversations with law enforcement. Omar thanked Pelosi for her statement.
Key excerpt: She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate — a contained island after scalp reduction surgery — surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men — the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color.
TRUMP: No. I never do that. I would not do that. I don't think -- I have too much respect -- if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything. I would not do that.
Obama, when campaigning in 2008, did misleadingly say that his plan would reduce premiums for families by $2,500. As we have noted before, Obama's pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs — not just premiums — were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. That nuance often was lost in his campaign statements, and he was quickly called out by fact checkers.
Lucas writes for the Daily Signal, a news and commentary site started nearly three years ago by Heritage, one of Washington's leading policy shops. The Signal covers issues that are a focus of Heritage's conservative agenda, such as an Obamacare repeal, tax policy and illegal immigration.
(7) Democrats are seeking to make health care the top issue in November while Republicans want to wave the bloody shirt on immigration (which will hurt them in states with large numbers of Hispanic voters) and to tout tax reform (which has not impressed many voters). Democrats have the advantage on the issue mix — and likely should heed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who warned to talk about health care and jobs, not Russia and impeachment.
And it would have taught the American people an invaluable lesson about their Constitution and the courts. No Americans knew about the Gun Free School Zone Act that the Rehnquist Court had invalidated in 1995. Most Americans were clueless about the civil cause of action for gender-motivated violence that the Court invalidated in 2000. Only a minority of Americans truly cared about the use of medical marijuana that the Court had failed to protect in 2005.
White House officials said Trump is squarely focused on the pandemic, not politics.
When I started, I was making less than I did when I was 15 in a summer job, said one former anchor. But the experience was invaluable — at least until the owner started massaging the news.
The committee approved a $51 billion plan including more than $5 billion to avoid a shutdown of the VA's Choice private-sector program, which is set to run out of money as early as the end of the month and could halt care for tens of thousands of patients, Hope reports. It paves the way for passage of the long-sought bill after previous failed attempts including in March, leading in part to Trump's firing of former VA Secretary David Shulkin, she writes. Nearly 40 organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars and the conservative Concerned Veterans for America, support the measure.
Mueller's Men — there were 11 lawyers and investigators, none female, in court for the van der Zwaan sentencing — aren't a cuddly bunch, Dana Milbank observed in a colorful scene piece. Van der Zwaan, with slicked hair, a tightly tailored blue blazer with brass buttons, French cuffs, a spread collar and a perfect half-inch of pocket square showing, offered a perfunctory presentencing statement ('I apologize to the court . . . I apologize to my wife and family'). The judge noted that she had received written statements from the defendant's parents, best friend, pregnant wife and wife's doctor — but nothing from the defendant himself. At this, van der Zwaan looked reproachfully at his lawyer. His remorse is 'somewhat muted, to say the least,' observed the judge, Amy Berman Jackson.
However, the White House press office, which oversees credentialing, operates under a looser standard. It has historically, on First Amendment grounds, been reluctant to exclude many kinds of publications, which has led to news organizations from across the political spectrum gaining access.
On most issues, the lanky Cotton, a rising star in the party, has emerged as one of President Trump's staunchest supporters, aligning in both tone and substance with the enthusiastic conservative base that helped elect the president. However, on health care, he has not marched in lockstep with the president, whose election made real the possibility of dismantling the ACA for the first time since it was signed into law.
Quite a few middle-aged people sitting in your audience that you just aced out of health coverage, another one said.
Schumer later Thursday morning sought to temper his comments.
We don't bid properly. We don't have proper bidding procedures. The reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don't bid. They don't go out to bid. WALLACE: Mr. Trump...
After Democrats killed his bill, Stanley filed an identical measure. As Northam was trying to persuade Democrats to pass that one, Stanley agreed to keep an open mind about Medicaid. Soon after, Northam dispatched his health secretary and Medicaid chief to Stanley's office. They made their pitch, but also picked his brain: What would a Republican plan for Medicaid expansion look like, they asked, even if he could not support it? He talked about work requirements, which wound up in the House plan.

Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
I doubt you can move all of them because that's difficult, and that will become a lobby war in this town, said Mike Strazzella of the lobbying firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney.
As a cascade of controversies consumes the White House, anxiety is rising among Republicans well beyond the Beltway that President Trump's troubles could take a severe toll on the party heading into next year's midterm elections and beyond.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.
Those calls continued even as the government is set to reopen, Katie writes, and groups plan to hand out products throughout the week while federal workers wait to finally get a paycheck.
— Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) seems to be unfazed by reports that Republican lawmakers are looking forward to hearings on her proposed Medicare-for-all bill in order to highlight proposals they're convinced will be unpopular with Americans. To this point, she tweeted yesterday:
[How preexisting conditions could derail House Republicans' health-care bill, explained]
The case will be heard in the court's next term — possibly before the November election — and the Trump administration still says it wants the law struck down. It also still doesn't have a replacement plan if the court were to acquiesce. This, too, represents not only terrible policy but also terrible politics.
* WALL STREET JOURNAL BLASTS TRUMP FOR ENDLESS LYING: The Wall Street Journal has a tough editorial hammering Trump for his nonstop pathological lying:
By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?
-- Get ready for the governors. Inslee is one of four current or former governors who could soon join the fray, Dan Balz notes in his column: They would bring executive experience and non-Washington credentials to a contest that so far has been defined largely by candidates who make their living inside the Beltway. … Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper has been scouting venues for his anticipated announcement. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe is itching to run but still weighing his prospects. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the current NGA chair, has been in and out of Iowa and New Hampshire taking soundings for months. Hickenlooper is a business-friendly Democrat who eschews negative advertising. McAuliffe, too, is pro-business with a centrist philosophy and relishes political combat. Bullock, who has a reformer's sensibility, was twice elected in a red state (the second time in 2016, when Donald Trump was winning Montana handily). Two of the past three Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, were governors.
A CNN host shared this image:
Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) announced that he could not vote for the legislation without revisions, singling out the measure's long-term spending cuts to Medicaid as the reason for his opposition. The announcement caught some Republicans in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's orbit by surprise.

To illustrate this, just look at how much money Part B could save if it also used a rebate system. Medicare could have collected $3.1 billion in 2011 if drug companies had been required to pay rebates similar to those paid under Part D, the HHS inspector general has estimated.

Three Democrats — Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Thomas R. Carper (Del.) — asked the EPA's Office of Inspector General to investigate Wehrum's conduct, saying it runs afoul of rules requiring federal appointees to recuse themselves from most matters involving former clients and employers for two years.
NYC Bar Association joins push to have [Rudy] Giuliani investigated to be disbarred , by CNN's Sonia Moghe: In a letter obtained by CNN, the NYC Bar Association said allegations call for a 'serious investigation' into Giuliani's actions, saying he used his position as an attorney who served in senior government positions including Manhattan US Attorney's office and Associate Attorney General of the United States to 'lend credence' to Trump's baseless assertions that the 2020 Presidential Election results were the product of widespread election fraud.
We were standing on a corner of White Plains Road near the working-class Morris Park neighborhood of the Bronx. The Bronx is the northernmost borough of New York City and is majority-minority: more than half Hispanic and more than 40 percent black. White Plains Road is something like a tunnel, lined with a mix of chain stores and local businesses and boxed in by the train tracks carrying the 2 and 5 lines overhead every few minutes.
-- In an internal post, Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said the company was responsible for Trump's 2016 victory and that it may help him win again this year. But he argued executives must resist the temptation to make changes that could alter the course of legitimate political debate. Craig Timberg and Nitasha Tiku report: The post ... reflected the combination of anguish, defensiveness and brash self-confidence that many of the company's employees have more privately expressed in the difficult aftermath of Trump's unexpected victory. Bosworth's post also shed light on the thinking within the company's highest levels as it heads into a new election year amid controversies over its reluctance to police lies by politicians or limit their ability to narrowly target small groups of voters. Critics have said that addressing both issues is key to helping stanch the flood of disinformation on the platform. …
But: In 2018, most of Congress will be singularly preoccupied with surviving their reelection that November. And just like getting yelled at by constituents, elections make lawmakers less — not more — likely to compromise with the other side.
Deadlines typically force action, Sarah Binder, an expert on Congress at the Brookings Institution and George Washington University told The Post in an email. That's why we call these spending bills 'must-pass' measures. It's not necessarily the case that Congress likes shutdowns, she added. It's a failure of the system rather than a choice of one or both parties.
When business groups pushed for passage of a modest gasoline tax to pay for a long-delayed highway bill, House Republicans refused to consider it. Business leaders watched in horror as Republicans closed down the government and threatened to allow the government to default on its debt. And when some of the country's biggest companies, including utilities and oil companies, formed a coalition to push for a market-based solution to climate change, Republicans pressured executives and directors to abandon the effort. Several did, and the coalition collapsed.
Spokespeople for Murkowski and McConnell did not respond to questions about why that provision was included in the measure. Murkowski has voiced skepticism about the way the bill has been crafted in recent weeks, and she has not signaled support for it.
The Biden team orchestrated a remarkable 72-hour rush of activity in which former rivals and a slew of other elected officials rallied to Biden. It was not merely the show of solidarity that was so compelling. Rather, it was the symbolic message that was so vivid: Biden is a bridge from the horrors of Trump to the promise of a whole new generation of bright, pragmatic progressives. Without too much imagination, one could see a single-term Biden presidency overseeing an administration filled with fresh faces that, after four years, will be capable of forming presidential tickets for decades. Monday's events were as much about this election — saving the Democrats from leaping into the left-wing populist abyss — as they were about setting the Democratic Party on a center-left trajectory.
I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks, Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed.
However, where it got sticky for Trump was when he actually hurt his own base. It's one thing not to make good on an unrealistic promise (cheaper, fairer, better health care for everyone!); it's another to take money out of their pockets.
In all, the repeal process could easily last into early spring or later, aides predicted.

Enthusiasm is on the Democratic side, Ross said, and the reason Democrats have performed poorly in past midterms is because their voters don't go to the polls. Democrats are running to the polls.
Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency, the statement said. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican Party ... Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look.
As a group, they have demonstrated a breathtaking lack of policy knowledge and sophistication, a stubborn disregard for intellectual honesty, lousy political instincts and a broken moral compass. Their leaders have forgotten what it means to lead, if they ever knew, while their backbenchers don't have a clue of what it takes to be constructive followers. If there were a bankruptcy code for politics, it's safe to say the Republicans would be in Chapter 11.

When we asked the Health and Human Services Department yesterday to confirm the guidance is in the works, a spokesman declined to comment. It's unclear when the agency might release the new exemptions, especially since the department is awaiting an incoming secretary, Alex Azar, who was confirmed by the Senate yesterday.
At an upscale coffee shop back near the museum, post-doctoral student Rene Esparza, 31, sat at a table behind an Apple laptop. He wasn't a super enthusiastic Clinton supporter (he, too, had backed Sanders), but considered her the better of two options.
You've already said you're not willing to shoot the hostage, so you've got to come to an agreement, one GOP lobbyist told me.
-- The Supreme Court last night temporarily blocked a restrictive Louisiana abortion law from taking effect after Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the court's liberals. Robert Barnes reports: The justices may yet consider whether the 2014 law — requiring doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals — unduly burdens women's access to abortion. The Louisiana law has never been enforced, and the Supreme Court in 2016 found a nearly identical Texas law to be unconstitutional. … The court's four most conservative members would have allowed the law to take effect. … The majority, as is custom, did not give a reason for granting the stay. But it seems likely the full court will now grant the case a full briefing and review, and perhaps reexamine its earlier decision, which was made by a very different Supreme Court.
The USMCA ends free trade in automobiles and auto parts with Mexico: By imposing impossible minimum-wage requirements on Mexican factories, the USMCA guarantees that cars and parts will be subject to tariffs — taxes paid by U.S. consumers. The USMCA also compels Mexico to change its labor laws to promote unionization. And the provision that the USMCA expires in 16 years is, Toomey says, designed to have a chilling effect on investment. He notes that members of Congress who have opposed every trade agreement before this one support it, as does the AFL-CIO, which generally opposes free trade agreements.
The former president has given his blessing to the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a project created to help his party undo Republican-drawn legislative maps. He made calls to help his former secretary of labor Tom Perez become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and congratulated him when he won. And he recorded a video for his post-presidential foundation, telling supporters that true democracy is a project that's bigger than any one of us.
Which is why Obama is telling Democrats to force Republicans to replace the law themselves. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said it more bluntly: If they want to break this, they own it. They know repealing and replacing the law is a very difficult proposition for Republicans — hence the GOP's decision to delay full repeal for as many as three or even four years — and that the promise of Democratic cooperation would only embolden the GOP's repeal efforts. (Right now, the GOP is taking a piecemeal approach.)
I felt normal and didn't really want to go take the physical, but if I hadn't I don't even know if I would be here now, Woosley, 55, said late last week, talking by cellphone, surrounded by cows from one of his fields east of Lexington.
At a campaign rally in Portsmouth, N.H., on Oct 15, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the election was being rigged by corrupt media and added that the media is pushing false allegations and lies regarding sex assault claims against him. (The Washington Post)
12:20 p.m.: Barr says he had no involvement in Rosenstein's decision to depart, though he was given choice of his own deputy
From Loren Adler, health-policy director at the Brookings Institution:
-- Virginia lawmakers voted to ban the use of handheld mobile devices while driving. Michael Laris reports: With passage of legislation by both houses of the General Assembly, Virginia joins Maryland, the District and other states nationwide in banning the handheld use of cellphones while driving. Supporters say they expect the legislation to clear final procedural votes and be signed into law. Fines would be $125 for the first offense and $250 for the second and subsequent; the law would take effect Jan. 1. … However, the effect of such bans on crash totals 'varied widely,' [researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] found. 'Despite the proliferation of laws limiting drivers' cellphone use, it is unclear whether they are having the desired effects on safety.'
Whether he reads them or not, in Trump's imagination, climate change will forever remain a hoax, or more precisely, not worth spending much time thinking about.
I'm not afraid of a tough fight. As Virginia's 72nd governor, I fought tirelessly against a radical Republican legislature that refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare (you'll have to ask them why they thought 400,000 Virginians didn't deserve health care). In the face of their relentless obstruction, we still extended health-care coverage to thousands of Virginians through my Healthy Virginia Plan, and we laid the groundwork for the successful passage of Medicaid expansion a few years later.
-- The president's allies at Fox News have elevated Schiff this week into perhaps the biggest boogeyman for their audience. Arguably he's a bigger target of their vitriol right now than Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders or even the four minority women in the Squad. If you've watched the network for even a few minutes this week, especially in primetime, you've probably seen hosts and guests attacking the man from Burbank.
Azar's numerous radio hits follows a report from our Post colleagues Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb that Trump lashed out at the HHS secretary for not doing more to address health care and drug pricing.
In a commentary for the Syracuse paper, he wrote that Trump's lack of tolerance and character made him unfit for high office, while Clinton stands and has stood for causes bigger than herself for a lifetime.
I think rallying public support is something that you really haven't seen, said one senior House Republican aide who requested anonymity to speak candidly. You don't have a lot of Trump supporters calling into Congress clamoring for repealing and replacing Obamacare.
Last night in Alabama, Warren acknowledged the difficulty of passing a constitutional amendment. She said maybe it will happen someday, but for now she supports the state-level efforts. This past Friday, Colorado became the 12th state to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. These states have agreed to deliver their electoral votes to whomever wins the national popular vote — even if that candidate loses their state. It will only take effect if states with a combined 270 electoral votes agree to participate. Colorado's nine electoral votes put the collective total at 181. Clinton carried all dozen of the states that have signed on. Legislation is moving right now in New Mexico and Delaware. But getting past 270 will prove very difficult.
Barr said he set out to get his views in front of the lawyers involved in the case. He said he broached the subject with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein at a lunch.
Barr refused to pledge to Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) that he would not intervene in the investigations into Trump being run by the Southern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, and other federal courts, arguing the request was as offensive as if Trump had asked him to pledge to a particular course of action.
[Trump took five positions on abortion in three days]
McCain also called on Trump to either retract or prove his claim that Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower during the campaign. I have no reason to believe that the charge is true, but I also believe that the president of the United States could clear this up in a minute, the Arizona senator told Jake Tapper. All he has to do is pick up the phone, call the director of the CIA, director of national intelligence and say, 'Okay, what happened?'
— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.
Two House aides confirmed to The Washington Post that Monahan was referring to a room where scores of House members were taken to during the riot, The Post's Paulina Firozi, Amy B Wang and Mike DeBonis report. Video first published by Punchbowl News on Friday showed maskless Republicans — including Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Michael Cloud (Tex.), Markwayne Mullin (Okla.) and Scott Perry (Pa.) — refusing masks offered by Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (Del.) while in the room.
Today, Barnett is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the Affordable Care Act, medical marijuana and the like. But his first encounter with the Federalist Society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early Federalist Society national student symposiums. Barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the Constitution. But he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. So he said yes.
The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is, one is pretty sick, but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape.
5:45 p.m.: Barr says he is open to reconsidering Justice Department's stance on Obamacare
Eliot Fishman, Families USA's senior director of health policy, and Cheryl Fish-Parchman, the group's director of access initiatives, wrote in a blog post Tuesday: Bottom line: If you create one pool for healthy people and one pool that only covers sick people — those with pre-existing conditions — you are thrusting sick people into a pool that is the very definition of a death spiral.
The bill would eliminate personal or philosophical exemptions to obtaining the vaccine -- but would still allow for medical and religious exemptions, Lena and Kristen report. The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Paul Harris (R), represents Clark County, the epicenter of the measles outbreak, and is planning to amend the bill to tighten religious exemptions, too, they write.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) described the events leading up to the Jan. 11 immigration meeting with President Trump. This has turned into an s-show, he said. (Senate Judiciary Committee)
CRUZ: Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the United States Congress acted to correct it.
Sanders is up on the air now in Michigan and other states voting next week with two new attack ads against Biden, focused on trade and Social Security. He hopes to use Biden's vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement as a cudgel to prevent white working-class voters from rallying behind Biden in the Wolverine State's primary next Tuesday. This constituency allowed Sanders to win an upset over Clinton there in 2016. Only one candidate for president has consistently opposed every disastrous trade deal, and that candidate is Bernie Sanders, a narrator says.
Brat is being very ,very smart if he's thinking, 'How do I keep myself out of trouble?'  he said.
Still, some remain skeptical that there is enough time to absorb the bill, make substantive changes to it and also hold a final vote, as McConnell is aiming to do this week.
Uhaul's chief of staff Jessica Lopez told the Arizona Republic that the nicotine-free policy, which will also cover e-cigarette and vaping products, is part of continued efforts to enhance our wellness program and decrease health care costs.
One of the bills with the potential for the greatest impact to come out of Walden's committee would lift a longstanding ban on Medicaid paying for substance abuse treatment at facilities with more than 16 beds. There's been some controversy around the measure – even though many agree this IMD exclusion is an old-fashioned rule no longer necessary for ensuring patients aren't stuck in mental institutions. But Walden said he believes lawmakers have found a bipartisan way forward on it.
On health care, for example, they promised to lower premiums but refused to embrace any of the three approaches that could accomplish that: increase co-payments and deductibles; squeeze the incomes of doctors, hospitals and drug companies; or finance more of the country's health care through higher taxes.
All of the policy considerations and policy constructs assembled by the House over the past couple of months may become moot, said Chris Jacobs, who advised the House Republican Conference on health policy while the 2010 health-care law was being passed.
The 2019 CMS Quality Conference continues in Baltimore.
President Trump's solicitor general, Noel Francisco, replied that the 5th Circuit decision simply preserved the status quo until a lower court could look more closely at which parts of the law should survive. He said it would be premature for the high court to intervene.
We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants, 5 million.
The ACA's dramatic impact in Cotton's home state — which leans conservative and voted heavily for Trump — has put the first-term senator in an awkward position. From 2013 to 2016, the uninsured rate in Arkansas dropped more than 12 percentage points — more dramatically than in any state except Kentucky, according to a Gallup survey.

He added: We pivoted from impeachment to 100 to nothing on this rescue package. This is about as flawless as you could possibly be.
The proposed plan announced in May would prohibit federal money from going to clinics that provide abortion services or referrals. The network of women's health and abortion clinics serves about 41 percent of Title X patients, receiving about $60 million from the program, Ariana writes.
Dismantle the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aims to prevent the excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis and was signed into law by Obama in 2010. (A 2018 law left the central structure of the post-financial-crisis rules in place, but it [made] the most significant changes to weaken the Dodd-Frank banking regulations since they were passed in 2010.)
The National Institutes of Health is scheduled to hold a meeting of the National Advisory Mental Health Council.
Northam and the House project hefty savings from expanding Medicaid. The governor predicts $421 million, while the House calculates $307 million, with different start dates accounting for the gap. They want that money sprinkled throughout the budget, to fund higher education, teacher raises and other needs.
Barr made clear earlier in the hearing that he, not ethics officials, would decide whether he will step aside from supervision of the Mueller probe. He repeated that assertion more forcefully under questioning from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.).
I don't think leadership wants to, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told Burgess. Cassidy had worked with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on last fall's Graham/Cassidy bill which, like a health-care before it, failed to gain enough support. In the sense of Graham-Cassidy, a partisan exercise? Doesn't look like it.
It would be a fitting end to this saga if the incompetent malevolence driving the ban — its hasty rollout for transparent political reasons; its obvious discriminatory intent — helped sink it.
Outside groups helped close that gap: $5 million was spent on behalf of Edwards, compared with $1.6 million on behalf of Van Hollen. But an anti-Van Hollen ad run by the group Working for Us that used video of President Obama may have done Edwards more harm than good by provoking the ire of the White House.
Some lucky people are getting early access to vaccine doses that would otherwise go to waste.
The list of potential executive orders, which the senator is still reviewing, include unilaterally allowing the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, directing the Justice Department to legalize marijuana, and reversing rules blocking federal funding to groups that provide abortion counseling, our Post colleagues Jeff Stein and Sean Sullivan write.
-- Inslee has significantly more experience than most of his better-known rivals for the nomination. He got elected to the state House in 1988, won a U.S. House seat in 1992, lost reelection in 1994 because he voted for the assault weapons ban, battled his way back to Congress in 1998 and stayed there until he won the governorship in 2012. His second term wraps up at the end of 2020. Inslee also recently wrapped up a successful stint as the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.
There are many uncertainties about this path. The health insurance market has a lot of churn, so many people may experience a gap in coverage of just a few months. One estimate, by the Commonwealth Fund, indicated that 30 million adults would have had such a gap in 2016, potentially exposing them to a surcharge or being placed in a high-risk pool. On top of that, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 percent of the people in the individual market have existing conditions that would have been uninsured before the ACA.
This package is pretty weak tea for climate change activists. But for the Club, these measures are anathema. Club for Growth PAC will not endorse any candidate that supports the liberal environmental agenda being pushed by Leader McCarthy, the Club's president, former Indiana congressman David McIntosh, said. He characterized McCarthy's measures as trying to get the political support of green socialists.
Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.

In the letter, the Democrats also worried people might lose coverage entirely at the end of January if they didn't pay their monthly premium due to uncertainty about getting subsidies. And they noted the IRS call center is closed, making it harder for marketplace customers to get their questions answered.
In a Fox News interview Sunday, Priebus said the tweet and Pirro's call were coincidental and that Trump was helping out a friend by promoting Pirro's show.
It's not possible to take Trump's aversion to war for granted, however, because seemingly everything is subsidiary to the erase-Obama imperative. Clearly, it's not about policy. It must be about something else.
-- After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced that he had enough votes to proceed with Trump's impeachment trial without reaching an agreement on witnesses with Democrats, Nancy Pelosi said the impeachment articles still won't go to the Senate until she learns more about how the trial would be conducted. Felicia Sonmez, Colby Itkowitz, John Wagner and Seung Min Kim report: In a letter to Democratic lawmakers Tuesday night, Pelosi hinted that she would not submit the articles nor tap House impeachment managers — who will effectively serve as the prosecution in the Senate — until McConnell publicly releases the legislation that would detail the parameters and procedures for the trial. 'Sadly, Leader McConnell has made clear that his loyalty is to the President and not the Constitution,' Pelosi wrote in the letter to colleagues. 'Leader McConnell has insisted that the approach under consideration is identical to those of the Clinton trial and that 'fair is fair.' This is simply not true. This process is not only unfair but designed to deprive Senators and the American people of crucial documents and testimony. Under the Clinton trial, witnesses were deposed.'
Taken together, all these arguments with zombies reveal much about the electorate and the Republican Party of today. Krugman writes: I see Trump not as a departure from the past so much as the culmination of where movement conservatism — an elitist dogma wrapped in populist rhetoric — has been taking us for decades.
The legislative challenge ahead – designing a broader stimulus bill to stop or dampen the effects of an economic recession – will be more arduous. Lawmakers have suggested a broad range of policy solutions; neither party's leaders have coalesced around a plan; and the president will surely continue to champion a payroll tax cut, even though Mnuchin and many Republicans have acknowledged that approach wouldn't help workers who lose their jobs. Reaching a bigger deal will also take more time, which could allow partisan messaging to infect the process.
TRUMP: So we need people — I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
There is a Supreme Court clerkship; Gorsuch was hired by Justice Byron White, a fellow Colorado native, who shared him with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
This year I owed $3,565 in federal taxes, apparently $1,300 of which is from the health-care exchange 'overpayment' because my unemployment was more than my projected income in November of 2019, said McCreary. This was a complete surprise to me.

Mercy launched its virtual hospital back in 2015, which staff proudly tout as the first hospital in the United States without beds. It now offers virtual programs including vStroke, vICU, vSepsis, vMentalWellness and vEngagement, a program where patients are given a box of medical equipment such as blood pressure cuffs and glucose monitors so they can be monitored within their homes.

The answer lies partly in the way the program was designed.
Trump announces his candidacy, immediately focusing on immigration and disparaging migrants from Mexico.
On the issues of abortion, immigration, and gun control, Hogan's appeal to conservatives who have rallied behind Trump would certainly be tested if he jumped into the race.
Paxton's case began after the Republican-led Congress in 2017, unable to secure the votes to abolish the law, reduced the penalty for a person not buying health insurance to zero. Paxton argued that in doing that, Congress had removed the essential tax element that the Supreme Court had found made the program constitutional.

Putting aside the question of whether Ryan really needs to fear the threat of his ouster, all of this is terrible news for those who hope for a more functional opposition party that might be able to work with Hillary Clinton on matters such as immigration reform and fixing the problems with Obamacare.
The standoff lasted 10 days. Then, on Bill's order, FBI agents stormed the prison, Hatch said. Within three minutes the hostages were freed and the federal agents did not even have to fire a single shot. Bill's decision-making and judgment saved lives.
[Klobuchar's] stances appear to be rooted in acknowledging a Democratic electorate interested in big ideas but recognizing that some proposals might be too radical to win over independents who backed Trump in 2016, Eugene writes.

The Capital Weather Gang reports: High winds rip across the region today, but then we have three straight days of calm, unremarkable weather.

Some potential 2020 contenders, however, are treading carefully, particularly after aides to Ocasio-Cortez, the plan's most prominent advocate, published and distributed a list of frequently asked questions that included details not included in the resolution itself, such as ensuring economic security for those unwilling to work. Her office later said it had inadvertently published an early version.
On Wednesday, the state's Senate passed a bill undoing requirements for women to undergo a 24-hour waiting period, an ultrasound and counseling before getting an abortion. The bill would also roll back a requirement for an abortion to be performed by a physician, opening the door to nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them. The legislation is backed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.
But the reach of the HIV initiative would be affected negatively under the administration's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and oppose Medicaid expansion, because reducing access to health insurance and medical care reduces access to HIV treatment and prevention. The Trump administration is proposing a sharp slowdown in Medicaid spending in the budget.
President Trump has tried to focus on hope — much of what he says not grounded in reality — rather than acknowledging the magnitude of the dual health and economic crisis playing out before him. But on Wednesday night, even he engaged in a rare moment of bipartisan outreach while reflecting on how Congress came together so quickly to help stop the economic bleeding.

The last line in particular raised eyebrows. Even before the latest controversies, there were signs of serious Republican challenges in some 2018 races.
More polarization will almost certainly lead to ever more bitter fights on Capitol Hill. If Democrats keep backing away from the Hyde language — they proposed in their 2016 platform for it to be abandoned — it could result in huge fights over virtually any health-care-related spending bill (this is the issue that derailed the marketplace stabilization measure championed last year by Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray).

The independent from Vermont who allied with the Democratic Party but always kept his distance has a lot to brag about. Across a broad front of issues, he has decisively moved the party leftward.
At Jackson's upcoming Senate confirmation hearing — which Capitol Hill staffers told me will be scheduled as soon as the White House submits the necessary paperwork — expect Democrats to probe the longtime White House physician on whether he supports a bipartisan bill the Veterans' Affairs Committee passed 14 to 1 late last year.
Arkansas is one of at least 14 states where conservative legislators have proposed outright abortion bans, in an effort to force to the Supreme Court to revisit its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide.
Biden should cancel all student debt and make quality education accessible to everyone, regardless of their income. While thinking of how to illustrate this topic, I noticed how similar the words loan and lawn are, so the idea of Biden mowing millions of dollar bills instantly came to my mind. It's a representation of a brighter and fairer future where people don't have to spend the majority of their adult life in debt as a result of student loans.
-- A growing number of civilians were killed last year in Afghanistan. Sayed Salahuddin and Pamela Constable report: The report from the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan said that 3,804 civilians died in 2018, including 930 children. That reflected an 11 percent overall increase from 2017, a year that also saw near-record levels of civilian war-related deaths. In the past decade, it said, more than 32,000 noncombatants have been killed and almost 60,000 injured.
Political parties and their leaders have two options: Engage in the competition of ideas and solve problems while moving the country forward, or continue to promote disinformation and false narratives designed to undermine our democracy. The choice should be obvious.

Right now, when someone loses their job and stays on their plan through COBRA, they must start paying the full cost of premiums. That's typically a huge added expense because employers often cover much of these premiums. But under the relief package, the federal government would kick in 85 percent of the costs.

— If Democrats win back control of the House this year, top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) says the Medicare for All proposals that many candidates are backing should be evaluated. These proposals represents a range of approaches, but they all involve more government backing of health insurance options for Americans. The statement is a shift for Pelosi, who suggested last year that these ideas have insufficient support from a majority of the public.
Republicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the Senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. That means the narrow Democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 Republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. And with the slimmest possible majority, Democrats will have to stick together. A single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.

Andrew Yang: So the pay-for, right now, if you have the Amazons and Netflixes of the world paying literally zero in taxes, and then the other big winners like Apple, Google, Microsoft, parking tens, hundreds of billions of dollars in profits overseas because they want to avoid paying taxes here in the U.S., then you have a consistent revenue problem that is just going to rise over time. And one of the examples I use, let's say a company comes up with artificial intelligence software that displaces most of the 2½ million Americans who work in call centers right now, making between $10 and $14 an hour. How much tax revenue will we see from the AI company? And the answer is probably nothing or next to nothing, because the AI company will have been bought by Amazon or Google, who will then park the revenue someplace else or not pay anything in taxes. Meanwhile, all of those 2½ million call center workers right now do pay taxes. And so we're going to have this growing revenue problem over time as software and technology do more of the work.
Russia still occupies territory of a sovereign Ukraine, to whom we gave pledges of defense when it gave up its nuclear weapons. Post-Trump, how should we approach a country that has occupied its neighbors, has committed war crimes in the Middle East, has interfered with our election (and those of other Western democracies), and has repressed its own people?
OUCH: Poor countries aren't getting the coronavirus vaccines.
As Ways and Means began considering its relief legislation Wednesday, chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) noted that the increased ACA subsidies would be accompanied by an increase in federal help in affording COBRA benefits, a type of insurance that laid-off employees from certain companies can purchase. They and other aspects of the committee's relief package will give Americans a sense of security in a time of overwhelming uncertainty, he said.
Funnily enough, one of Ernst's best friends happens to be running for president: her colleague on the Hill, Sen.

If I asked you to explain the Republican case against the covid relief bill, what would you say? Well, they think it's too expensive, and they'd rather not give too much help to states and localities. But their arguments against it seem halfhearted, anemic, almost resigned. In fact, that's how you could describe much of the Republican opposition to the Biden presidency as a whole.
The word I would preach here is patience, said J. Kevin Appleby, a board member at the Hope Border Institute, an immigrant aid organization in El Paso. Everyone expects automatic results and automatic change. But it's going to take time to reverse what Trump did.
There were 71 new cases of the vaccine-preventable disease in the third week of April, with 22 states now reporting cases.
-- One in five women doubt that a woman can win the presidency, according to a new CNN poll. What's telling about this news is that just 9 percent of men said the same. (Eugene Scott)
But Express Script's move comes while under a harsh spotlight, as one of several leading pharmacy middlemen often accused of failing to pass on to patients discounts provided by drugmakers. It, along with CVS Health and Optum — the country's leading pharmacy benefit manager (PBMs) — will appear at the latest Senate Finance Committee hearing on drug prices next week.
I think the short-term theme is getting as close as possible to universal coverage under the Affordable Care Act, said Eliot Fishman, a health policy expert at Families USA who was part of Biden's transition team.
They're at the table, the aide said of Cruz and Lee. They've had meetings all year. They're working with us to get a bill done.
The Biden administration is so worried about running out of shelter space for teenagers and children who cross the border without their parents that shelters have been authorized to purchase airplane tickets and cover other transportation costs for minors whose relatives are already living in the United States, according to an email from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement — which runs the shelters — that was obtained by The Post.
— Johnson & Johnson must pay $186.5 million in punitive damages to four plaintiffs who said the company's talcum powders caused mesothelioma, the Wall Street Journal reports.
I certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause.
Basically, America put the same people who shut the government down back in office.
On the other hand, those with access to health care are likely to fare better.
It seemed a year ago that Trump, with the leadership of the GOP in Congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace Obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at Guttmacher. That also included the defunding of Planned Parenthood. This was a very real item and real concern for us. I think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.
He writes that the FDA should accelerate its process for reviewing manufacturers' e-cigarette applications. He also argues that the agency should implement and enforce the newly passed minimum-age increase for tobacco product purchases and that it should update regulations governing the sale of tobacco products to account for the higher age restriction.
Symmetric reductions in price variation would lead to a decrease in our sample's medical spending, the researchers wrote.
Congress probably recognizes what economists say: This is going to get worse. We're at 5.5 percent unemployment after the first full week of this crisis. We could hit 30 percent, predicted James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
As part of a tweet storm condemning the House Republican bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used a talking point that a number of Democrats have used when attacking the changes that proposed legislation would make concerning the handling of preexisting medical conditions in the individual market.
I say it with a smile on my face: He's a different kind of president, McConnell said.
Officials at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have called off two college basketball games after administrators announced two students who had recently traveled to China were being tested for coronavirus. Reis Thebault reports:. One of the students visited the campus health center on Monday and exhibited flulike symptoms, prompting staff to test him and his travel companion, a university statement said. The two students are now isolated in their off-campus residences while they await their test results from the CDC.
At stake is Biden's top legislative priority, one that requires all 50 Senate Democrats to stick together if there is no Republican support to be had. National polls show a clear majority of Americans support passage, but success could turn on a handful of lawmakers.
After the dinner, Romney says that the conversation was enlightening and interesting and engaging and that Trump's picks for his administration gave him increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.
To help those suffering from opioid use disorder, the FDA is prioritizing new efforts to advance the development and use of safe and effective MAT, the agency said.
Horn, who was accused of anti-Trump bias during her tenure as chairwoman, said she has noticed a significant increase in the level of anxiety about the president and his behavior from party leaders around the country over the past two weeks.
— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.
BETO: Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke is heading to the early presidential voting state of Iowa this weekend, fueling speculation that the Democrat is poised to enter the White House race, per Reuters's Tim Reid. In an announcement posted on Twitter, Eric Giddens, an Iowa Democrat who is running in a special election for a state senate seat, said his campaign workers and O'Rourke will be urging students this Saturday at the University of Northern Iowa to vote in his election race.
WALLACE: Well, then, we want to focus now on the economy, which is one of the top issues on Facebook, with 6.6 million people discussing it online. A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit, where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent. That's more than double the national average.

THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
He's looking at how to bridge a gap that seems to be insurmountable and try to find a way to get this, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), a defender of the bill, said in a Friday interview.
-- As the bill's contents remain unclear, some reports suggest that the Senate may vote to cut Medicaid by even more than the $800 billion that the House approved last month. The Hill reports: The proposal would start out the growth rate for a new cap on Medicaid spending at the same levels as the House bill, but then drop to a lower growth rate that would cut spending more, known as CPI-U, starting in 2025.… That proposal has been sent to the Congressional Budget Office for analysis, a Senate GOP aide said. The aide said that plan has been described as a 'consensus option that has been sent to CBO,' though no final decision has been made yet. Another aide said there are still other options in the mix. Democrats and some more moderate Republicans were already warning about Medicaid cuts in the House-passed bill.
Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
Stephen Colbert introduced us to the political consultant the Democrats hired to look over the New Hampshire vote:
Some experts warn potential administrative headaches may dilute the popularity of the program. The child benefit in Biden's plan would only last one year, but senior Democrats have said they will seek to make it permanent.
Partisan differences still abound: 8 in 10 Democrats viewed the ACA favorably in March, while almost as many Republicans (75 percent) viewed it unfavorably. Independents were split, 45 percent favorable, 41 percent unfavorable.
The key, he says, is to tell voters that Trump is just playing politics with the issue, even as Democrats offer a more compassionate approach to those immigrants now living in the country.
These are among the indications that Jackson's confirmation process could be an unusually controversial one for the Veterans' Affairs committee, which has historically confirmed nominees by wide margins and in a biparrisan manner. Democrats feel the White House wants to go too far in privatizing VA, and they'll be suspicious of Jackson if he's a strong proponent of that view.
Warren said that she believes women should have the full range of reproductive services. She said that it's not enough to rely on the courts to protect abortions rights and Congress must act.
And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.
The campaign's ire was raised further by Matthews's commentary as Sanders swept to an early lead in Nevada on Saturday. Matthews compared Sanders's performance to Nazi Germany's shattering military victory over France in the early months of World War II, suggesting Sanders's path to the Democratic nomination was unstoppable. 'It's over,' said Matthews, referring to a French prime minister's assessment of the battle and possibly the war. The comparison was flawed in several respects (France was eventually liberated and Germany was crushed by allied forces), but Sanders's representatives expressed outrage that Matthews had compared Sanders to Hitler's soldiers, given that Sanders, a Jew, lost family members during the Holocaust. … Matthews apologized to Sanders on his program, 'Hardball,' on Monday night. 'As I watched the one-sided results of Saturday's Democratic caucus in Nevada, I reached for an historical analogy and used a bad one…,' he said.
It's important to remember that an estimate made from a baseline is simply a snapshot in time — what the analysts believe will happen at the moment, based on the information available. Lawmakers must rely on those numbers for months — until new data is received and another estimate is made.
Wolff reports that in early August 2016, Trump asked former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes to take over management of the campaign. Ailes turned him down, Wolff writes, because he knew of Trump's disinclination to take advice or even listen to it.
Anthem's withdrawal from Ohio's exchange — markets created by the law where people who buy individual insurance plans can take advantage of federal subsidies — will leave 10,500 people from Ohio in 18 counties with no choices, according to Ohio's Department of Insurance.
Google is helping to develop a website, Trump told the country. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past — a dig at the Obamacare website — to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.
I just signed two executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars.
I want to protect consumers from price gouging by establishing a prescription drug accountability division within the State Corporation Commission, a state agency with real teeth that already regulates the insurance industry. It would intervene and set limits for drug prices, make manufacturers defend attempted price increases and keep high-cost drugs affordable. I will also further regulate pharmacy benefit managers — the mysterious industry middlemen that live and profit between insurers and pharmacies — and revoke their licenses to operate in Virginia if we catch them engaging in predatory practices.
'Let me put it very plainly, he says. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.
Things look brighter in the states running their own marketplaces. Enrollment in state-based exchanges actually increased by 1 percent this year, even as enrollments on Healthcare.gov declined by 4 percent. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced last week his state will revert to its own marketplace as a way to protect residents from federal efforts to undermine the ACA.
It's a striking admission from the senator, who poured energy into advancing a bipartisan measure he co-wrote in late 2017 with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to infuse more funding into the Obamacare marketplaces. The effort showed a rare GOP openness to improving the health-care law, but it all collapsed under fights over federal funding for abortion (as I detailed at the time).
For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --
The numbers help explain Trump's strategy of fanning fear about immigration while creating controversy around the issue that tends to enrage Democratic voters. In a typical provocation, Trump said Friday that he was considering releasing detained immigrants in liberal cities as punishment for the Democrats' refusal to change immigration laws. A few weeks earlier, he labeled Democrats the party of open borders, drugs and crime.
When Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) asked why an anti-kickback rule essentially barring rebates exists under the Social Security Act but not for prescription drugs, there was laugher in the room when Holtz-Eakin said he can't explain that and won't pretend to.
While Americans are curious about what a Medicare-for-all-type approach might look like, they're a lot more concerned with improving the coverage they already have, Protect Our Care leaders Leslie Dach and Brad Woodhouse wrote in a memo provided to Health 202.
-- Tensions escalated between the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the U.S.-backed opposition trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the country. Anthony Faiola and Rachelle Krygier report: Maduro has defiantly vowed to block more than $60 million worth of assistance organized by the opposition and provisioned by the United States, Colombia, Canada and other countries. Even as seven truckloads of aid from the United States began arriving at warehouses in the key border crossing of Cucuta, Colombia, Maduro loyalists pledged to use force if necessary to keep it out. Elliott Abrams, the State Department special envoy to Venezuela, said ... while determined to deliver the aid to the Venezuelan people, the United States and other opposition supporters would not do so by 'force.'
The plan is an alternative expansion option for Democrats who don't want to get rid of private insurance. Under the plan, people could buy a plan on an ACA individual or small business exchange, acquiring access to the network of Medicare providers and physicians in addition to the benefits of other plans under the ACA such as maternity and newborn care, Politico's Marianne Levine reports.
As hosts of the retreat, the chairs of the respective House and Senate conferences were most uncomfortable dealing with Trump's call for a major probe into his assertion that upward of 5 million votes were illegally counted in November.
The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.
Federal district court appointments Despite President Trump's record pace of appeals court appointments, at the federal district court level he lags behind some recent presidents at the same point in their administrations.

Political control D Clinton R Senate R House Why it happened President Bill Clinton and the GOP disagreed on how to balance the budget within seven years, with Clinton using more optimistic Office of Management and Budget projections, and Republicans using Congressional Budget Office estimates. How it was resolved Senate Republicans gave in to pressure to reopen the government, and the party temporarily abandoned their goal of enacting a seven-year balanced budget plan. Read more
In those remarks, Trump seemed to be showing a decision-making bias known as the sunk cost fallacy. This occurs when people pursue a questionable course of action not because it's the prudent thing to do, but simply because they've already invested time, resources or energy into it. It's like sitting through a terrible two-hour movie just because you paid for the ticket.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
Just when the president seemed to be benefitting from squabbling inside the Democratic Party, he is taking a step that will unite it again: declaring an emergency as a way of moving money toward the construction of a border wall. This is, and always has been, a less popular idea than the border wall itself. Look for every Democrat running for president to denounce it.
Who's that? Trump reportedly asked, unaware that Boehner had been the speaker of the House until he was forced out in a tea party putsch in 2015.
Letters from BIO and PhRMA, which represent some of the largest drug companies in the world, appear to be an attempt to influence the Biden administration's Special 301 report, an annual report that determines the countries targeted by the United States. for World Trade Organization settlement dispute.
In a Sunday interview with ABC's This Week, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he still considered the bill to be in the negotiation process and that conservatives and moderates would come together, hopefully in the coming days, to find consensus.
Trump's 2020 campaign manager praised Kim Kardashian:
Four times Trump got history a little wrong:
Yet Trump reverted to his old attacks on the ACA this week, turning up pressure on Republicans to try once again to repeal it, just hours after CMS released final 2019 enrollment totals on Monday. There was a clear disconnect between his rhetoric and that of Verma, who stressed that the signup season went smoothly.
Speaking to the donors Monday, Ryan gave an explanation similar to the one he offered reporters on Friday — where he said that moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains.
We got it from the president.
In one camp were a pair of blunt-speaking Midwesterners, Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — both beloved by many liberals, yet both dismissive of fellow Democrats' promises to create a vast new apparatus of government-backed health care, Alexander writes. They endorsed incremental policy changes, like lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare.
Monsanto's headquarters will remain in St. Louis. With the acquisition effort already public, this new domestic expansion has not been broadcasted anywhere previously, and is not something -- and it is something that has been in the works with Bayer and Monsanto previously. The reason for this commitment and expansion is because of the president-elect's focus on creating better business climate here in the United States, which is already increased consumer and small business confidence since the election.
The proposal is similar to Biden's own — so similar, in fact, that he has accused Buttigieg of stealing his idea.

Del. James W. Will Morefield (R-Tazewell) said the welcome mat is out for expansion in his coal-country district, where a local board of supervisors and chamber of commerce passed resolutions in support. He said he was unfazed by AFP, which has targeted him with Facebook ads, phone banks and a Stop Obamacare meeting planned in his back yard April 7. Even with a free lunch tossed in as an enticement, only four people have signed up so far.
The rebrand also comes as a former Valeant executive is on trial in federal court in New York on charges that he defrauded the company.
The FDA must set standards and regulate this industry much more closely, starting now. It's shocking that parents are basically being completely left in the lurch by their government, subcommittee Chair Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told The Washington Post.
Among the many inequities covid-19 has revealed is how the burden of child care has fallen squarely on the shoulders of working women — and the deep imbalances by race, social class and even marital status when it comes to child care in the United States. Reporting has shown how some low-income and single mothers have had to choose between their jobs or taking care of their children. Those women are also less likely to have backup child-care options. And low-income women of color are more likely to be essential workers putting their own health at risk. Since the pandemic began, hundreds of thousands of women have left the workforce — that's bad news. Our economic recovery depends on having women participate in the economy.
That approach — backed by House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) but rejected by the rest of the House GOP leadership — would not only tap federal funds to provide health care to as many as 400,000 uninsured Virginians, but also would allow the state to take more than $420 million currently devoted to health care and spend it on other priorities.
I don't see how after the American public sees the whole story laid out here … this whole scenario laid out before us, I don't see how Donald Trump could be reelected to the presidency again, Murkowski told reporters.
The day after his inaugural I photographed probably one of the best protests I've ever seen, which was the Women's March, he said. Was so much love at that protest.
As for the trade deficit with Mexico before the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States ran trade deficits in goods (Trump's preferred metric) with Mexico five out of the 10 years before the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, according to the Census Bureau. In the years when the United States ran a goods surplus, it was never more than $5 billion and usually about $1 billion to $2 billion. But what matters is not the deficit or surplus but rather the level of trade between the two countries. Cross-border trade in goods was about $100 billion in 1994, compared with more than $500 billion in 2018. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015 (the latest data available).
The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission holds its January meeting starting.

But there's no guarantee Jackson will provide a comprehensive report, because undergoing a physical is voluntary for a president and Trump can pick and choose what the public hears.
These proposals would make insurance options more affordable, both for Americans who recently lost their jobs — and subsequently their health plans — and people who didn't have employer-sponsored coverage to begin with.
Rep. Ron Wright (R-Tex.) died at 67, weeks after testing positive for coronavirus. Wright, who represented Texas's 6th Congressional District since 2019, had been battling cancer since 2018. He is survived by his wife, Susan, three children and nine grandchildren. In a statement, his campaign said Wright will be remembered as a constitutional conservative. He was a statesman, not an ideologue.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a hard-line conservative from a ruby red state, was optimistic about the progress Tuesday but stopped short of endorsing any of the options presented in the meeting. Failure is not an option, he warned afterward.
Times are changing: Sanders, who now leads in pledged delegates, says he thinks the candidate with the most pledged delegates – even if they fall short of the majority – should win the nomination this summer. In 2016, he encouraged superdelegates to flout primary voters and embrace him instead of Hillary Clinton.
Members of Congress qualified for priority access to the coronavirus vaccine, and many — but not all — have received at least the first shot of a two-dose regimen. Some congressional staffers have received the coronavirus vaccine as well, our colleagues write.
How you get this payment is a bit more complicated. Though the federal government pushed the tax-filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, the IRS still recommends filing your taxes soon. If the agency doesn't have your 2019 return, it will use your 2018 return to calculate your relief payment.
Owens, though, is breathing new life into the idea. Earlier this month, she tweeted:
So to your question, first you have measurements for these things, and I would suggest that just having these be a primary element of how we pay attention to our own health and progress would be game changing, because right now the messages that Americans get are that things are great. You can tell because the stock market's setting new highs and these numbers look very positive and rosy. But then Americans sense that those numbers don't correspond to how their communities are doing. They're seeing that eight Americans are dying of drug overdoses every hour, that their kids are addicted to either smartphones or drugs. And so that disconnect is causing massive, massive problems.
Murray also cautioned that we don't know how long people's natural immunity lasts and that it could vary from person to person. This uncertainty may be an added reason to encourage people to get the vaccine.
But so far, Democrats have spent the bulk of their time lambasting Republicans over various ways they've undermined protections for patients with preexisting conditions or pushed what Democrats term junk insurance plans — topics that helped Democrats win the House majority last year. Over the past two months, Democratse have held a half-dozen hearings framed along these lines.

The Department of Labor reported on Thursday that 4,760 federal workers applied for unemployment in the final week of December, they add. That's a more than 500 percent increase from the previous week, when there were only 929 claims. The number is expected to climb in January, and food banks are reporting a growing need by federal workers who aren't getting paid.
Sounds a lot like President Trump's attacks on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, but as Paul Krugman reminds us in his new book, Arguing With Zombies: Economics, Politics, and the Fight for a Better Future, conservatives' use of misleading or inaccurate information to justify cuts to assistance and entitlement programs dates back years, most notably to George W. Bush's failed 2004 effort to privatize Social Security.
-- John Kasich, one of more than a dozen Republican governors leading states that have accepted the Medicaid expansion, warned in ominous terms against the House bill. When you jam something through, just one party over another, it's not sustainable, the Ohioan said. We're talking about lives. ... We better be careful we're not losing the soul of our country because we're playing politics.
A person familiar with the White House-Congress relationship said that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Trump used to speak nearly daily on the phone when the House was mired in debating its health bill but that the calls have scaled back since it passed. Pence keeps in closer touch and was in Ryan's office Tuesday, talking through upcoming legislation.
About 40 members of Congress, including Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, have stated they will not attend the swearing in and my understanding is that in the wake of president- elect's criticism of Representative John Lewis, there are other lawmakers still deciding whether to attend.
In a statement, Jacqueline Ayers, vice president for government relations and public policy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the filing yet another out of touch attack on women's health and rights – based on dangerous lies. Republican leadership is shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn't exist in reality.
House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the newly minted GOP chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed to crack down on the shenanigans played by major drugmakers to limit lower-priced alternative medicines.
Already, the version of the bill the House passed last month included drastic reductions in Medicaid outlays of about $834 billion over 10 years. GOP senators' own version of the bill, which they made public Thursday, could go even further over the long term.
One small step toward clarity would be a national education strategy that elevates a curriculum focused on the human condition, critical thinking and the responsibilities we have not only for ourselves but for those around us. We would be a better nation if we committed more brain power to the study of theology, philosophy and poetry. Each of those disciplines has the capacity to weave ethics, morality and sensitivity into our public dialogue in a way that is thoughtful rather than bombastic. They could teach us to engage each other with rigor, but also mercy. If only there were a national mandate and budget for bringing instructors in those specific fields into elementary and high schools — settings where we begin to get a tenuous grasp on our place in the world. This isn't an argument for bringing religious doctrine, prayer or articles of faith into public schools. Far from it. But there's a benefit to a secular study of world religions if only to better understand racism, war, gender inequities, economics and the breadth of human history. Religion has undergirded so many cultures and brought about the destruction and desecration of others. To study it as an intellectual discipline, not as an act of faith, might finally free this nation from its divisive God fever. Philosophy could give us the tools to consider our individual lives in the context of the moral universe. We can ask ourselves the big questions: What is happiness? What is justice? How do we define equality?
So if you already have wealth or power, You're on your own will be terrific. You'll be able to keep more money without being burdened by taxes to pay for a bunch of stuff that doesn't benefit you and you only (Republicans haven't even started cutting taxes for the wealthy, but have no fear: There's a windfall coming your way). You will no longer have to worry so much about laws that might keep you from exploiting or even defrauding other people. Did you expect anything different from the head of Trump University, who scammed so many people out of their life savings?
The blueprint is the beginning of our conversation with the American people, and we look forward to hearing their ideas, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.). This is not our tax code — this is the American people's tax code, and we need their input.
Trump criticizes Romney's reaction to the loss.
-- The Atlantic, The Fertility Doctor's Secret, by Sarah Zhang: The first Facebook message arrived when Heather Woock was packing for vacation, in August 2017. It was from a stranger claiming to be her half sibling. She assumed the message was some kind of scam; her parents had never told her she might have siblings. But the message contained one detail that spooked her. The sender mentioned a doctor, Donald Cline. Woock knew that name; her mother had gone to Cline for fertility treatments before she was born. ... They had found her on Facebook, she realized, after searching for the username linked to her Ancestry.com account. ... Apparently she did have relatives on Ancestry.com ... They said their parents had also been treated by Cline. They said that decades ago, without ever telling his patients, Cline had used his own sperm to impregnate women who came to him for artificial insemination. According to her DNA, Woock, too, was one of his children.
To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.
But when Chauvin's trial for his alleged role in Floyd's death begins, much of the argument will center instead on the autopsy details, most specifically whether fentanyl and underlying health conditions — not the police officer's actions — stopped Floyd's heart and lungs, The Post's Lenny Bernstein and Holly Bailey report.

As FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb can't tell drug makers how much to charge for their products, unlike the top officials regulating the drug industry in many other developed countries. But when he was confirmed back in May, Gottlieb identified generics as the space where the agency could potentially have the most impact in the quickest way – both by making it easier for companies to develop generic drugs and nudging generics into markets with no existing competition.
A senior administration official said it seems Trump is convinced that family separation has been the most effective policy at deterring large numbers of asylum seekers, NBC's Julia Ainsley and Geoff Bennett report. It is in keeping with other reporting, including from The Washington Post, suggesting Trump wanted to take a harder line on the increase in migrants arriving at the border in recent months. After Nielsen was rumored to be a target of Trump's ire last year, he reportedly took a more positive view of her leadership after Border Patrol used tear gas to repel a crowd, including families, trying to enter through a gap in a border fence.
OOF: New research reveals the Food and Drug Administration, doctors and drugmakers mishandled the dispersal of the powerful opioid fentanyl, which led to thousands of ineligible patients gaining access to the painkiller.
The scam may end up running even deeper than this. One might argue that Trump promised his voters something better than safety-net protections: good jobs with benefits. Indeed, as Catherine Rampell reports, the White House is defending its cuts by arguing that the true measure of success is the number of people we get off of those programs. This is compatible with Trumpism's promise to restore an old economic order via a revival of manufacturing and coal — jobs are better than government help, and surely many of his voters made this calculation. But what if those jobs don't ever materialize? Trump's renegotiated trade deals and his infrastructure plan are a long way off. If this promise of Trumpism never comes to pass, all that would be left behind is the massive downsizing of the safety net, justified by conventional GOP rhetoric about freeing people from Ryan's version of the safety net, the dreaded hammock of dependency. This isn't what Trumpism was supposed to be about, on many levels.
Wagner is sponsoring the House version of the bill, with Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) as a co-sponsor. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) will be a co-sponsor in the Senate.
Trump has been on the cover of Time magazine a total of 11 times. Richard Nixon holds the record — 55. Depending on whether you count small photographs or not, Hillary Clinton has been on the cover between 22 and 31 times.
-- New York magazine, It's a Theyby! Is it possible to raise your child entirely without gender from birth? Some parents are trying, by Alex Morris: For a small but growing cohort of parents — ones who see gender as a spectrum rather than a binary — the unisex movement of the '60s and the 'gender neutral' parenting trends that have followed have come up woefully short. For them, society's gender troubles cannot be solved by giving all children dolls and trucks to play with or dressing them all in the color beige; the gender binary must not simply be smudged but wholly eradicated from the moment that socialization begins, clearing the way both for their child's future gender exploration and for wholesale cultural change.
You can't get rid of Medicare. It'd be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works, Trump said in November. In a campaign where Trump has constantly changed his mind about what he believes, this is a subject where he's remained constant. Trump agrees with Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders: No cuts to Medicare.
I've employed — I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.
After Trump told people to go get your shot during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday, the New York Times asked a former adviser whether the president had been vaccinated. The adviser told the Times that he had.
* GIULIANI EXPLAINS TRUMP'S EXEC ORDER: Some argue that the new executive order isn't a Muslim ban. Rudy Giuliani gave away the game on Saturday night, saying this:
Utah, Idaho and Nebraska excited advocates for the ACA when they followed suit a year later. Yet the ballot questions don't appear to have swayed many conservative Republicans, who have cited concerns about the burden of Medicaid on state budgets and generally dislike the idea of expansive government insurance programs.
Been laid off? Out of work? Then be grateful for this perk,
As the pandemic has caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and upended services like publicly funded day care, demand for diapers has surged. Diaper banks are struggling to keep up.
And one of the things I say on the trail is that corporate profits are at record highs, but also at record highs in the U.S.: stress, anxiety, financial insecurity, student loan indebtedness, mental illness, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, and that life expectancy has declined for the last three years. So if your corporate profits are going up and your life expectancy is going down, which do you listen to as a society? So step one is to get the measurements right. Instead of trying to use these crude economic measurements as proxies for our well-being, we should just measure our well-being. So what is our well-being? Health and life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, childhood success rates, proportion of Americans who can retire in quality circumstances, environmental sustainability. You could even have variables like civic engagement and artistic and cultural dynamism.
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
Still, Barr stressed: I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interfere with the election, and I think we have to get to the bottom of it. He also said under questioning that for a president to pardon someone in exchange for that person not incriminating him would be wrong: That would be a crime.
Ryan said Thursday that he and Trump are completely in sync on health care and suggested that more details would be on offer at the yearly congressional Republican retreat, which will be held in Philadelphia the week after Trump's inauguration. Trump is scheduled to address lawmakers there.
The former is undermined by his well more than 30,000 falsehoods as president. The latter is undermined by his record.
-- Testing the waters in Iowa, de Blasio criticized Hillary Clinton. The New York Post's Julia Marsh reports: 'We're not going to win by talking about Donald Trump,' the mayor said … 'I have deep respect for our previous nominee — I know her very well — but I think a lot of us would say that was one of the mistakes, the focus on Trump,' he said. … He also faulted Clinton for failing to unify her party after winning the nomination. 'There was not a true effort to say, 'Okay everyone come in together.' … The mayor defended his progressive bona fides during a question and answer session with reporters by saying that Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren are 'kindred' spirits. He also gave an unexpected compliment to the president saying, 'Don't go to sleep on Donald Trump when it comes to strategy. He should not be underestimated.'
* NO REFUGEES HAVE CARRIED OUT RECENT FATAL TERRORIST ATTACKS: CNN delivers another dose of reality:
But, Trump said, Flynn had erred by misleading government officials, including Vice President Pence, about his conversations, which is why the president ultimately demanded his resignation.
-- Here are some steps that may follow once Mueller's report comes out. (Dan Keating and Aaron Steckelberg)
I don't want any deaths, right? But over the last long period of time, when people have the flu, you have an average of 36,000 people dying. I've never heard those numbers. I would — I would've been shocked. I would've said, 'Does anybody die from the flu?' I didn't know people died from the flu — 36,000 people died.
But Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the one Republican who opposed a Senate test vote on repeal in January — arguing that it did not go far enough — warned that even the new version of the AHCA fell short of his standard.
Sinema's office responded to the backlash Friday night by suggesting to HuffPost that it was sexist. Commentary about a female senator's body language, clothing or physical demeanor does not belong in a serious media outlet, said spokeswoman Hannah Hurley.
Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the campaign, criticized the constant moving of the goal posts by Democrats in areas where the president has made progress that exceeds what his predecessors accomplished.
Calling the president 'mentally ill' in order to insult or undermine him causes actual harm to people with mental health disabilities, the group said in a statement.
Ironically, because the cost of premiums is capped depending on household income, this ended up making health insurance more affordable for many families in the exchanges, as the increased cost was simply passed onto taxpayers.
On June 15, the Cleveland Clinic announced it would jump into the Ohio individual market through a joint venture with New York-based Oscar Insurance Corp., a health insurance tech startup, despite what officials called the turmoil and the uncertainty around the public exchange and the public marketplace.
Get an assessment of each candidate on last night's stage from The Trailer. Here's what happened Wednesday, from Washington Post reporters Sean Sullivan, Annie Linskey and David A. Fahrenthold:
Mental health advocates cautioned against making conclusions as the details surrounding the second student's death remain unclear, our colleagues write, even as many in the community placed the deaths in context of the other lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas last year.
Two recent studies have identified Gorsuch as the federal judge on Trump's list of potential nominees most in tune with Scalia. And liberal Justice Elena Kagan is among many who have praised Gorsuch's lucid and occasionally lyrical writing style.
Well, that's okay. I've been here before, and I never resist arrest. Just, be careful if you cuff me because I have a bad shoulder.
-- Citing the press of other work, special counsel Bob Mueller's team requested a delay in responding to The Post's request to unseal documents in Paul Manafort's case. Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report: In a two-page filing, Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben and prosecutor Adam C. Jed wrote, 'Counsel responsible for preparing the response face the press of other work and require additional time to consult within the government.' A response had been due March 21. … The Post has objected to the abundance of sealed and redacted records in Manafort's Washington case and petitioned the judge in his case, Amy Berman Jackson, to open them to public view.
At least one of them is now stepping forward.
It's the second week of February and we are at more than 95 co-sponsors, he said. Coalition building is a process, but we are on track to introduce this historic legislation with resounding support at the end of the month.
Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.
* States could further cut reimbursement to doctors and hospitals and drug companies, resulting in yet even more cost shifting.
Republicans can't undo the harm they've done to patients and families, but they can avoid doing further harm—which is why if they're serious, Republicans will work with us on changes so that Alexander-Murray helps to lower families' health care costs and stabilize markets as it was intended to do, Murray said.
Working with community providers to adequately ensure that veterans' needs are met is a good practice, Shulkin wrote. But privatization leading to the dismantling of the department's extensive health care system is a terrible idea.
Republicans and fiscal conservatives offered tepid praise for the president's proposal, which would not balance the federal budget until 2034. Republicans have long called for more significant changes to Medicare and other mandatory spending programs that are the biggest drivers of the national debt.
10. The guy at the bar who sends your girlfriend a drink
At the Agriculture Department, the crisis has allowed officials to move ahead with a program to deliver of food boxes for rural communities. The administration's earlier efforts to save money by substituting traditional food stamps with government harvest boxes have repeatedly been rejected by Congress.
Update: We initially rated this claim as Three Pinocchios. Considering the totality of Harris's statement, claiming that as many as 129 million could be denied coverage, we are changing the rating on this fact check to Four Pinocchios.
It didn't save a dime, Mr. Hanna told the Syracuse paper of the tea party maneuver. It was sold as something that would save money, but it absolutely did not. The conversation revolved more around people not liking what they thought NPR represented. And I looked at that as a type of censorship through the power of the purse.
The Trump administration says its proposed ban on the rebates that drug manufacturers pay to these firms that manage pharmacy insurance would help lower drug costs. But it could also mean seniors pay somewhat more. Individual premiums for Medicare prescription drug insurance could jump 19 percent next year under the move, while the monthly cost to individual seniors could rise by about $6, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland writes.
Duterte has been criticized by human rights observers for killing thousands in his war on drugs, and this praise fits into a broader pattern of Trumpian affection for authoritarian strongmen.
It certainly doesn't make it any easier for Republican candidates in highly educated districts, Ayres said. The atmosphere in Washington and attitudes toward the president create a far more energized Democratic base than you'd otherwise have.
— The Trump administration announced an expansion of a ban on U.S. aid groups that provide or promote abortions overseas to now include groups that financially support other groups that provide or promote abortion.
The New York Times revealed the counterintelligence probe late last week. Barr said he had never heard of such a thing and, when asked by Graham whether there were any checks and balances to such investigations, Barr responded: Not outside the FBI.
Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), in a tweet to the president, went even further, saying that Trump needs to purge Leftists from executive branch before disloyal, illegal and treasonist [sic] acts sink us.
Open with black-and-white video of a nurse, a carpenter and a machine operator hard at work as 7.65% flashes on the screen and the announcer declares, For these hard-working Americans, this is what goes from every paycheck to pay their fair share of Medicare and Social Security … Then cut to a slick and cocky hedge fund manager getting his shoes shined at the office while doing a derivatives trade on his cellphone, and with 0% flashing on the screen as the announcer picks up, … while this Wall Street hedge fund manager doesn't pay a dime.
But in the four months since, Trump has done relatively little to make it happen. The president has treated health care and a host of other legislative agenda items, from taxes to infrastructure, as issues to be hammered out by lawmakers with often-scant direction from the executive branch — and with decidedly mixed signals from Trump himself.
-- The press coverage continues to be overwhelmingly unfavorable to the House bill:
De Blasio: Records matter, he said, pointing out that he has seen the face of poverty and has tried to improve health care in the city.
• Require more FBI criminal background checks. Biden would stop exempting private sales unless the transaction is between close family members. He also wants to allow the government 10 days, up from three, for the checks to be carried out.
A panel of three federal appeals judges, all notably appointed by Republicans, struck down both the abortion discrimination law and a measure requiring that fetal remains not taken home by the woman must be buried or cremated similar to dead bodies (although Judge Daniel Manion wrote in a dissent that he would have upheld the latter law.)
Thank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.
One of the dirty little secrets of the shutdown is that it's not even a fight Republicans particularly desired. In fact, the GOP-controlled Senate passed a regular government funding bill via unanimous voice vote last month, before President Trump changed his mind and insisted on money for a border wall. Republicans largely have stood behind Trump, but they seem to be tolerating him more than cheering his strategy.
Biden and Senate Democrats agreed to tighten income limits for $1,400 stimulus checks. Under the changes agreed to by Biden and Senate Democratic leadership, individuals earning under $75,000 per year and couples earning under $150,000 would still receive the full $1,400 per person benefit. However, the benefit would disappear altogether for individuals earning more than $80,000 annually and couples earning more than $160,000, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. The deal is meant to pacify moderate Democrats who demanded more targeted spending.
So when I wrote that day, I resisted the temptation to assail McCain, using the mild word disappointing to describe his vote. Then I added: But McCain could yet advance the vision of the Senate he outlined in his floor speech and rebuke 'the bombastic loudmouths' he condemned by casting a 'No' vote at the crucial moment. Here's hoping this war hero will ultimately choose to strike a blow against everything he said is wrong with Congress.
There is major backing for the legislation. All the major veterans services organizations are behind it, including the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Shulkin had indicated he was a fan if you read between the lines of his outgoing New York Times op-ed last week.
The lifesaving drug has become unbearably expensive, and it can sometimes lead patients who struggle with the costs to ration their supply. Did Alec die because he was rationing? Tiffany writes. The answer may never be absolutely clear, but his family is convinced that he was skimping on his doses. Several people she interviewed described insulin as being like oxygen. Scavenging for it invokes a primal fear, like the gasp you make just before you run out of air, she writes.
KELLY: ... And this is what -- standby, this is what the Court of Appeals found. They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims...
Trump slammed Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), whose description of how the law might apply to a live birth prompted accusations from Republicans that he was implying infanticide.
The measure, which is the first of its kind in the nation, is backed by at least five other Democratic lawmakers, the Maryland NAACP, Baltimore City Health Commissioner Leana Wen and the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition, which helped draft the plan.
I would have certainly -- I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.
Biden's nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget faced tough confirmation hearings as lawmakers scrutinize her past tweets.
KELLY: With respect, you've made that point.
The good news for Azar is that his reception inside his new department has been decidedly positive, both within HHS and from outside observers. The warm welcome is a sharp contrast from to the feelings surrounding the new secretary's predecessor, former congressman Tom Price (R-Ga.), who resigned in disgrace last fall over his use of private jets.

Seven of them are clustered together in the nation's southeast. There's also Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Kansas and South Dakota.
The Health 202 wrote last week about the many varied Medicare-for-All-style plans Democrats have proposed so far.
And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out. (APPLAUSE)
— It's too hard for cheaper drugs known as biosimilars to get covered by insurance plans, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said yesterday at an event hosted by the Atlantic. Gottlieb warned the situation could discourage drugmakers from developing these less-expensive versions of high-cost specialty drugs, noting that few biosimilars have made it to market in recent years.
It is not simply that Trump is an ignorant narcissist; rather, the concern is that his ignorant narcissism poses a risk to the country — one that brings us to the brink of war with Iran, emboldens Russia and leaves the United States vulnerable to a pandemic, which in turn may bring on a recession.
In a June 2017 poll, Kaiser found that protection for people with preexisting conditions was an issue with bipartisan support.
We have many, many people that will be witnesses. Again, I don't settle cases. I don't do it because that's why I don't get sued very often, because I don't settle, unlike a lot of other people.
The president is a dealmaker, and he realizes that 30 members of the House shouldn't control the process, Ruddy said. He is looking for a way to develop a majority that doesn't include them.
The bill has three Democratic co-sponsors, but just one — Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois — has added his name to the petition, Melanie writes. Freshman Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah), who is not a co-sponsor, also signed on to the petition. By the end of the day, the effort had secured 191 signatures.
— Not all agencies have halted work. While many federal scientists across the country have been affected by stalled funding and the inability to continue research, the New York Times's Alan Blinder points out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation.
10:50 a.m.: Barr details his discussions about possibly being Trump's lawyer
Six House and Senate Democrats leading health-care-related committees raised these issues yesterday, asking HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to ensure marketplace enrollees don't face unexpected premium costs even as the shutdown continues.
Perry took over USA Gymnastics after CEO Steve Penny resigned in March 2017, months after the initial reports of Nassar's crimes. In the days after Nassar's January sentencing hearing, the entire board of USA Gymnastics resigned after threats from the USOC to decertify the organization, Liz notes. A week later, after two U.S. senators called for his job, Scott Blackmun resigned after eight years as CEO of the USOC.
-- Bernie Sanders warned Republican lawmakers against invoking the nuclear option to confirm Gorsuch, calling on his GOP colleagues to keep existing rules in place that allow for a filibuster. I certainly hope that the Republicans do not change the rules in order to push Gorsuch through, the Vermont senator said on CNN's State of the Union. His remarks come just one day after Mike Pence warned Democrats about blocking Trump's nominee during a speech in West Virginia, saying he and Trump are confident that the Senate will confirm Judge Gorsuch one way or the other.
Many Democratic incumbents in states Trump carried who were once thought to be vulnerable are now doing quite well. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is up 11 points while Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) led by double digits in a May poll in a Wisconsin landscape that looks increasingly hostile toward Gov. Scott Walker and Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has a solid in lead in the two most recent polls. It is too early to say these Democrats are safe, but they are surely less of a concern than Democrats had feared six months or a year ago.
Trump earned Four Pinocchios for this claim. Trump was looking for scapegoats to excuse his administration's slow efforts to expand testing. But he cannot blame Obama.
He's not only committed to repealing Obamacare, but making sure we do replace it with a plan that does exactly what Obamacare was supposed to actually do, and that is, as I mentioned, lowering the cost for all Americans and doing so in a way that doesn't limit their access to either their plan or -- or their doctor.
Bill Clinton tried to paint a picture of Hillary as Mom this week, describing his wife as the best mother in the whole world.
We'd love to get, you know, 52 votes on whatever it is that ultimately emerges from the Senate, said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the third-ranking Republican senator. But we know we have to get 50 plus Vice President Pence.
-- The Saudi crown prince told a top aide he would use a bullet on Jamal Khashoggi a year before the Post contributing columnist was killed in Istanbul. The New York Times's Mark Mazzetti reports: The conversation, intercepted by American intelligence agencies, is the most detailed evidence to date that the crown prince considered killing Mr. Khashoggi long before a team of Saudi operatives strangled him inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and dismembered his body using a bone saw. … The conversation appears to have been recently transcribed and analyzed as part of an effort by intelligence agencies to find proof of who was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's death. The [NSA] and other American spy agencies are now sifting through years of the crown prince's voice and text communications that the N.S.A. routinely intercepted and stored, much as the agency has long done for other top foreign officials, including close allies of the United States.
Then there are allegations of Bloomberg's mistreatment of women, which would follow him into the general election and neutralize any advantage Democrats might have had over Trump with suburban Republican women. Bloomberg's alleged history of making lewd and sexist comments to women, as well as lawsuits accusing him of presiding over a culture of sexual harassment and degradation at his company, Bloomberg LP, will not go away, nor will his refusal to release women who made allegations from the nondisclosure agreements that were put in place as part of legal settlements. As we saw on Wednesday, he was paralyzed when challenged with specific comments attributed to him or demands that he release women to tell their side of the story.
Jeff Mason, the WHCA's president, said his group would review the criteria for selecting members of the supplemental pool — the group of reporters who can supplement the regular pool when needed — but he declined to say whether the Daily Signal's recent participation prompted the move.

Ryan also presided over a dysfunctional House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. Ryan has frequently provided political cover for Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), seemingly giving Nunes wide latitude to steer the panel through more controversial areas of an investigation that ultimately splintered the once-bipartisan panel.
-- Harvey Weinstein was threatened with jail for repeatedly using his cellphone while in court during the second day of his New York trial on sexual assault charges. From CNN: At the beginning of court proceedings in New York, Judge James Burke raised his voice and reprimanded Weinstein and his defense team, specifically Arthur Aidala, for Weinstein's use of his cell phones. 'He was calling and texting a minute ago,' Burke said to the defense team. Weinstein said, 'I'm sorry' and hung his head at one point. Donna Rotunno, another defense attorney, said she was not aware. 'He was aware,' the judge replied. Burke said this was an 'ongoing issue' and referenced warnings at previous hearings. He said he warned Aidala explicitly in 'somewhat unrefined terms' about Weinstein's cell phone. Finally, he said that if Weinstein uses his cell phone in court one more time he will be taken into custody. 'Mr. Aidala, this is on you if he blows it,' Burke said.
We have better use for 10K every year than to blow it on premiums, he wrote to The Post.
In total, companies have raised costs on 445 drugs at the start of the new year.
--Yesterday, recreational marijuana became legal for adults over 21 in California -- but resident still aren't able to buy pot everywhere as businesses struggle through red tape to be allowed to sell it, The Post's Katie Zezima reports. Along the way, an edgy, sexy industry has become beholden to reams of regulations and compliance issues — in other words, marijuana has become just another business in California, Katie writes. The change has not been easy, and some feel in limbo as the cannabis industry, which has been valued at between $5 billion and $7 billion, starts to take form.
Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly, Trump said. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages.
But NBC's Benjy Sarlin breaks down why critics say the policy shift is a bad idea: Opponents of the decision have argued that work requirements go beyond Medicaid's stated goal to provide aid to low-income households and that only Congress can expand its objectives to also include pushing people toward employment. This is likely to be a primary contention in lawsuits challenging the administration.
Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election have been vocal in calling out President Trump's actions in Iran that have heightened tensions. (The Washington Post)
Mind you, the commentary wasn't uniformly positive. But you can see for yourself. The tool above includes every actual caption including the words Trump is — unless they were difficult to decipher or mentioned another Trump. This is what Trump hears when he turns on his TV in the morning.
What we're proving today is if we have a Republican president next year, we will repeal Obamacare, Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters, using a nickname for a law that GOP lawmakers have despised since it was pushed through Congress six years ago.
The White House warned airline executives the U.S. government may suspend all flights to and from China if the coronavirus outbreak become a bigger public health threat. Luz Lazo reports: White House officials said they are not banning flights just yet, but said the U.S. government will assess the situation daily, leaving open the possibility of a ban on all flights from China … Airlines in recent days have already canceled hundreds of flights scheduled from China's Wuhan International Airport, giving U.S. health officials a brief respite as they focused on the logistics of rerouting U.S.-bound travelers from the region to one of five airports for special screening. Travelers are being funneled to airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, where they are being screened for the virus. If cleared, they are allowed to continue to their final destination. British Airways also indefinitely suspended direct flights today to Beijing and Shanghai.
Republican senators in other states that expanded Medicaid have openly worried about the impact the language in the House bill would have on people who obtained coverage through the initiative.
Here's an overview of the HHS regulations most likely to get scrapped or changed first, according to multiple people who have advised the new administration.
Trump's presidency was surreal, he said. The American people get lost in all this stuff, you know? It's just all about the industrial-military complex and big banks.
With Fortune 500 drug firms raking in $67.7 billion in profits in 2016, more revenue is the last thing the industry deserves. But a failure to contain drug costs isn't the only shortcoming of Trump's proposal. The whole pharmaceutical system — from the way medicines are developed to how they are tested, regulated, promoted, priced and provided — is broken, bent to the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. It cries out for reform.
The House Budget Committee holds a hearing on the HHS budget.
In 2015, California state Rep. Scott Wilk became the first Republican in years to vote yes on a state budget — all because he was distractedly slamming the very same budget proposal on Facebook as he voted.
The answer is the same in both cases: an unwillingness to speak truth to power. In businesses, employees speak truth to power when they deliver unwelcome facts to their bosses. In government, appointed officials do that when they tell elected leaders something they don't want to hear. But in a democracy, the people are the ultimate source of power. Our elected officials work for us, and they fail us when they decline to tell us truths that we, the people, don't want to hear. Even worse, they fail us when they set up false expectations we desperately want to believe.
income enrollees with out-of-pocket costs — a move that ironically resulted in making the premium subsidies more generous.
I have no idea what he was talking about, Thomas says in the sympathetic film Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words.
The Democrat went on for nearly 25 minutes, pacing, his voice resuming its normal tone and then just as quickly going back to yelling about President Trump, the border wall, immigration policy, the Freedom Caucus.
As McCain's turn to vote arrived, the Senate clerk nodded at him. The Arizona Republican paused, then gave a dramatic thumbs down, eliciting gasps from the Democratic side of the chamber and grim looks of resignation from the GOP leadership that had spent the past few hours trying to get him to change his mind.
None of this should come as a surprise to anyone watching the Republicans' relationship with Trump over the past 2½ years. It's true that there are growing signs of a rift between Trump and Republicans, especially over foreign policy, Trump's increasingly aggressive immigration policy and his attempt to revive the health-care debate. The nearing 2020 presidential election means many congressional Republicans, McConnell included, are up for reelection, too, and they need to do what's best for them. (So, not re-litigate Obamacare.)
Republicans have been more amenable to expanding the safety net under Trump's presidency than they were during the Obama-era recession, she said, noting that only three Senate Republicans — and none in the House — supported the 2009 stimulus package.
Cornyn rose to express his gratitude.
Medical treatment can be exorbitant in rural areas, in part because hospitals are few and doctors do not have much competition. Trump's strongholds have been in many of those same rural places across the country.
As a Member of Congress who is deeply concerned about declining vaccination rates, I am requesting additional information on the steps that you currently take to provide medically accurate information on vaccinations to your users, and to encourage you to consider additional steps you can take to address this growing problem, Schiff wrote to Facebook and Google chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai.
What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?
TRUMP: By the way, that's the other thing...
Here in Philadelphia, the murder rate has been steady — I mean just terribly increasing.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.
Then along came President Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic. The government's initial response to the crisis was again muddled, with limited testing capacity making it impossible to either measure the spread of the virus or even approximate containing it.
The previous administration looked very closely at the hardship exemption to make sure it was serving the people who needed the exemption, Peck said.
Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.
Officials should promise to enforce the individual mandate to ensure healthy people buy coverage, Kreidler wrote in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services. He also urged HHS to assure insurers it will keep paying extra cost-sharing subsidies and to consider setting up a new, federal reinsurance program to spread risk among insurers.
In a year when outsiders have captured the national imagination, Maryland Democrats chose the insiders: the deal-making Van Hollen and presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) -- who had forged an agreement with her Republican counterpart Lamar Alexander on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to pay insurers for extra Obamacare discounts -- says that agreement is no longer valid because Republicans changed the playing field by dismantling the mandate. A Murray spokeswoman said the senator has made clear that the bipartisan bill she originally agreed on with Chairman Alexander simply is not designed to fix any of the problems Democrats say Republicans are causing for Obamacare by repealing the mandate and working through executive action to pull back on its regulations.
Even without state action, involuntary commitment for drug addiction is being used more often, the AP found. In Florida, there were more than 10,000 requests for commitment in 2016 and 2015, up from 4,000 in 2000. In Massachusetts, there were more than 6,000 forced commitments in 2016 and 2017, up from less than 3,000 in 2006. In Kentucky, there were 200 involuntary commitment orders last year, up from just five orders in 2004.
Gottlieb is scheduled to leave his post at the FDA tomorrow, a decision he announced several weeks ago saying he wanted to spend more time with his Connecticut-based family. Laurie reports this morning that he'll return to the American Enterprise Institute to work on drug prices.
Republicans are loath to step on their tax bill success by shutting down the government.
— When asked by Grassley to name one way to lower drug costs, former CBO Director Doug Holtz-Eakin suggested changing the 340B drug program, which has grown far beyond its original scope. The first thing to do is stop having policies that push up drug prices and one that comes to mind is the 340 B program, he said. It was a well-intentioned program that was intended to provide drugs at lower costs to needy patients. But it's not well-targeted on those patients right now, it's leading to higher drug costs, and I would encourage the committee to take a close look at reforming the 340B program.
On several occasions, Price suggested he may define how much insurers would have to cover under the category of essential benefits, which includes maternity and newborn care as well as substance abuse and mental-health treatment.
Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.
I have a responsibility to use my judgment and discretion … I'm not going to go around saying this U.S. attorney or that U.S. attorney I'll defer to, he added.
Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who is considering a 2020 presidential bid from a state that has been shifting to the right, said Tuesday that elected officials ought to address climate change aggressively but stopped short of endorsing the specific resolution backed by Ocasio-Cortez and others.
I thought that was very informative, Charles Herring said, and people could decide what they believe.
Basically, House Republicans handed Democrats a political club — and Democrats gleefully beat them over the head with it in the 2018 midterms, said Michael Steel, a longtime House GOP strategist who advised the independent advertising unit for the National Republican Congressional Committee last year.
Kaiser estimated that cumulative premium increases were 63 percent for 2001-2006, 31 percent for 2006-2011 and 20 percent for 2011-2016.
The price hikes have frustrated patient advocates and lawmakers, who have stressed there's no logical reason for why drug makers would so dramatically raise prices for a medication whose chemical makeup hasn't significantly changed.
When you're talking about a 40 percent cut, you're talking well below the cost of doing business, said Waldman, a single-payer opponent. The money has got to come from somewhere – and if it doesn't, the public will simply not have doctors.
If I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I'm really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop-and-frisk. When I got into office, there were 650 murders a year in New York City. And I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That's the basic right of everything. And we started — we adopted a policy, which had been in place, the policy that all big police departments use, of stop-and-frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. And when we discovered — I discovered — that we were doing many, many, too many stop-and-frisks, we cut 95 percent of it out.

And a maintenance worker at the Capitol, already looking ahead to the inauguration, leaned against an elevator wall, holding a vacuum cleaner in one hand. As the quiet elevator arrived at a floor bustling with congressional staffers, the man turned to tell his co-worker, wearily: You might as well enjoy it. Next week, it's going to be hard to get in this building at all.
2. Prescription drug monitoring programs. Petty was receiving multiple medications that heightened his risk of overdosing. This dangerous concoction probably didn't come from a single doctor but from multiple providers, Lipi writes. A statewide — ideally nationwide — prescription drug monitoring program could have alerted clinicians about Petty's list of medications.
-- Quinta Jurecic and Ben Wittes argued on the Lawfare blog two weeks ago that most observers do not appreciate the many reasons that Mueller's biggest findings might remain under wraps: So far, Mueller has behaved like a traditional prosecutor. He has not made public statements beyond what he has argued in court. What the public has learned about his findings — at least what it has learned from Mueller's shop — it has learned when he indicted people or reached plea agreements and facts emerged in the context of their prosecutions. This is the orthodox approach to federal prosecution. Prosecutors, after all, are not reporters. And federal investigations are not truth commissions. Remember the anger among many current and former federal prosecutors directed at then-FBI Director James Comey for announcing and discussing the evidence following his decision not to pursue charges in the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Normally, when prosecutors finish an investigation and don't bring charges, they say nothing, and the evidence they have collected stays secret.

But these charges from Democrats and progressives are not only overstated — they're also aimed at some policies originally proposed by President Obama. Consider this:
Delaney: The country is on a mission to find the America that's been lost.
Because the provision wasn't included in the bill itself, the House Ways and Means Committee is now trying to get the current IRS regulation to become law. A key Republican on the committee, Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.), introduced a separate bill to add a belts and suspenders level of protection for premium tax credits for veterans.
Here we had this 'strong economy,' and all of a sudden the bubble has burst, and policymakers are scrambling to put into place basic protections other societies have, said Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.
In other words, the policy details do not matter to Trump in the least — he only wants the win of repealing former president Barack Obama's signature achievement, and it is irrelevant that the replacement would not honor his promise of insurance for everybody. But the bill's Republican critics are objecting on substantive grounds. House and Senate conservatives claim it would not lower costs and still leaves too much of the ACA in place. Moderate Senate Republicans, meanwhile, oppose the bill on the grounds that it would roll back too much of the ACA's coverage expansion, and the American public appears to agree.

He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
Far from backing Trump, Manhattan was one of the most heavily pro-Hillary Clinton counties in the country in 2016, supporting her by a 77-point margin. (In his home county, Trump won only 9.7 percent of the vote; for every 2.6 votes he got, a third-party candidate got one.) We don't hear much about how Manhattanites have responded to the first year of Trump's presidency, though, despite how much we've heard about how regions central to Trump's candidacy are still home to people who stand by their choice. There are a lot of reasons for not focusing on the views of people in Manhattan, including that the city is not without a voice in the media and that how it voted was not particularly surprising (compared to the fervent support Trump enjoyed in the Rust Belt).
But Kavanaugh has so far leaned away from the topic. Last month, he joined the court's four liberal justices, plus Chief Justice John Roberts, in declining to take up cases that could have opened the door for states to withhold Medicaid dollars from providers who also offer abortions. Four of the nine justices must consent in order for the Supreme Court to hear a case.
Cancel visas to countries that won't take back criminal immigrants in the United States illegally. Trump was slow to act on this pledge. In September 2017, the Trump administration announced visa restrictions against four relatively small countries — Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone, followed by Myanmar and Laos in 2018 and Ghana and Pakistan in 2019. He has not targeted China, one of the biggest offenders, but eight of the 10 countries that have faced such sanctions have been named during the Trump administration. Given that Trump suggested during the campaign that he would target all countries, this will be considered a compromise.
Others said no to abolishing private health insurance, including Klobuchar and O'Rourke. That led to the first real candidate-to-candidate exchange of the night, as de Blasio — one of the lowest-polling candidates on the stage — jumped in to ask O'Rourke, Why are you defending private health insurance?
The racial disparity in mortality rate has disappeared for men under 50 and women 70 and older, she reports.
The Heartland Institute embraces views that have long been considered outlier positions by the scientific community. In 2012, the group paid for a Chicago billboard that read, I still believe in Global Warming. Do you? alongside a picture of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. The Mercers have given this group more than $5 million in recent years.
For instance, we asked, when a [your party] politician votes against the party on a key issue, have you ever wished they would get sick and die? Five percent of partisans said yes; 95 percent said no. While that number is low, it isn't zero. Keep in mind this is not just dislike or disfavor; it is wishing death on fellow partisans.
-- Climate change will disrupt the global economy, but central banks aren't ready. From the Times: A report issued this week by an umbrella organization for the world's central banks argued that ... central bankers lack tools to deal with what it says could be one of the biggest economic dislocations of all time. The book-length report, published by the Bank for International Settlements, in Basel, Switzerland, signals what could be the overriding theme for central banks in the decade to come.

Republicans have a June 13 primary battle of their own among former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, Prince William County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart and Virginia Beach state Sen. Frank Wagner. The winners will square off in November.
But Denmark's concrete industry isn't exactly a perfect comparison to the U.S. health-care system. Economists still don't have a great sense of how hospitals might change their behavior once they start posting prices online.
Buttigieg also showed once more his understanding and real emotion on issues such as drug addiction and mental health. But he was thrown on the defense when asked about his record on race and drug arrests, trying to sidestep the avalanche of statistics the moderator dropped on him. It is on race, of course, where his campaign is most vulnerable. Attacked for taking money from billionaires, he defended taking money from whomever he can. Mayor of South Bend, Ind. is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse, he retorted. He sounded like a grown-up ready to fight.
Over the next few days, he reiterates this idea in tweets. Trump, on the same platform, mocks him.
What's next for Luxturna? The treatment's success rides on whether insurers will agree to pay for the costly drug. And Spark has a plan to sweeten the deal: the company announced it will offer a partial refund for health insurers if the drug doesn't work in the first three months after treatment and may consider a refund again after two and a half years. The company also emphasizes commercially insured patients should pay nothing for the treatment, despite its $850,000 price tag.
Lawmakers will likely interrogate Barr about the memo and press for specific guarantees that he will leave Mueller's probe alone and make Mueller's ultimate findings public. For his part, Barr said in written testimony released in advance of the hearing that on his watch, Mueller would be allowed to complete his work, and that it was very important Congress and the public be informed of the results.

Bloomberg, who unlike Trump is a self-made man, built his business empire, which employs about 20,000 people, around terminals that provide immense financial data. He also takes credit for creating half a million jobs in New York City during 12 years as mayor. While he may be freely spending his own money for this campaign, Bloomberg emphasized that he's trying to identify policies that won't drown the country deeper in red ink.
Calling it the dumbest thing I ever heard and an embarrassment, he voted against delays in implementing the health-care law because of a GOP provision allowing insurers or others to claim religious or moral objections to providing birth control coverage.

At a town hall April 7 in Oskaloosa, Iowa, Sanders also pushed back on a voter's question that suggested he supported open borders.
An MSNBC anchor took over the network's Instagram:
Planned Parenthood estimated that roughly 40 percent of its funding would be at risk should defunding legislation become law. Democrats are gearing up to defend against GOP attempts to attack the group. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other lawmakers rallied Thursday afternoon on Capitol Hill with executives from Planned Parenthood and other women's health organizations.
In a statement after voting for the bill, Kustoff said: We promised the American people we would repeal and replace Obamacare, and today, the House voted to keep our word and provide relief. … This bill would protect and ensure access to care for those with preexisting conditions, and moreover, it will make health care more attainable with lower premiums.
-- The favorite talking point for most Senate Republicans continues to be that they're learning nothing new because House managers are repeating themselves. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told reporters during last night's dinner break that it felt like Groundhog Day in the Senate. Ironically, he had repeated throughout the day that it felt like Groundhog Day. He said the same thing to CNN in the morning.
The campaign is not lackadaisical. Yang has staff in early states, takes meetings with local Democratic leaders and gets a seat at the table at Democratic events. He reminisced about his speaking slot at last year's Iowa Wing Ding, where national media descended to cover the first — and given recent news, probably the last — major campaign speech by attorney Michael Avenatti.
-- The CIA, in partnership with West German intelligence, secretly owned a Swiss company that sold rigged encryption devices to more than 120 countries, which allowed it to read the coded messages of allies and adversaries for decades. Greg Miller reports: The Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican. But what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. … The decades-long arrangement, among the most closely guarded secrets of the Cold War, is laid bare in a classified, comprehensive CIA history of the operation obtained by The Washington Post and ZDF, a German public broadcaster, in a joint reporting project.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.

Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.
-- To be sure, just because something is hard and hasn't been done before doesn't mean it's not worth doing….
But in states that didn't expand Medicaid — and therefore cover only people at much lower income levels — women can lose their coverage 60 days after giving birth, even though their infants remain covered for a full year. That forces them to move between insurance plans even as they're recovering from childbirth and caring for an infant. It's a particularly vulnerable and exhausting time for women, who may face pregnancy-related health complications or need help with breastfeeding or postpartum depression.
In his last stint as attorney general, Barr espoused a hard-line view on criminal justice issues that might be out of line with current reforms. But Barr argued that it was unfair to compare the Justice Department's approach to criminal justice in the early 1990s to the situation today.
In the United States, the HIV initiative will focus on the parts of the country that account for more than 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses.

Conley's language about Trump — 'very good health overall'— was less effusive than the language used last year by Trump's former doctor, Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, who referred to him as in excellent health, noting he was very healthy and had good genes, Toluse and Carolyn write.
-- The Department of Transportation's discretionary spending would also be cut by 13 percent, including deep reductions in spending on Amtrak and airport grants, as well as cuts of more than $2 billion in highway infrastructure funds. At the same time, the administration introduced what it called a historic, 10-year, $810 billion reauthorization of surface transportation programs, which would cover highways, transit rail and other programs and would replace a five-year transportation bill, known as the FAST Act, which will expire later this year.

President Trump's impeachment defense could create a dangerous precedent, says constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley. (The Washington Post)
The briefing's significance was largely in the tone it set, adhering to Biden's pledge to shape federal pandemic-fighting policy through data and scientific expertise. It contrasted with briefings by the previous White House's coronavirus task force, which typically were led early on by President Donald Trump, then by Vice President Mike Pence before fading in frequency as last year progressed, Amy and Lena write.
Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation:
— Yesterday, some prominent Capitol Hill Republicans expressed support for preserving the ACA's insurance protections for people with preexisting health conditions, something that could become a casualty of the Trump administration's request last week for a court to reconsider all of Obamacare now that the mandate is going away (we explained this in Tuesday's Health 202).
Provide veterans with the ability to receive public Department of Veterans Affairs treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. In 2018, Trump signed the bipartisan VA Mission Act, which expanded access for veterans to VA-funded care in the private sector. (This built on a law passed under Obama.) Rules established under the law took effect in 2019, with VA paying veterans to see non-VA doctors if they have to wait longer than 20 days or drive more than 30 minutes for primary or mental health care at a VA facility. For specialty care, they can see private doctors at VA expense if they have to wait longer than 28 days or drive more than an hour to see a VA provider.

In a vacuum, Rosenstein's leaving is not necessarily worrisome. It is normal for an attorney general to want his own deputy. Barr has said publicly that the last time he served as attorney general, during the George H.W. Bush administration, he made clear he wanted to pick his own No. 2.
In other ways, McConnell believes he has made an impact, notably with the Gorsuch nomination.

Asked what she'd do about the border crisis on Day 1 as president, Harris focused on other aspects of immigration, saying she would reinstate protections for undocumented students who've been in the country for years. She also said she'd reinstate and extend deferred deportations for parents, and would provide protection for veterans. (All of those proposals are popular with voters.)
Last month, a group of 50 top executives publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. Although many were longtime Democrats, from finance and high tech, the list also included a few die-hard Republicans, such as Hewlett-Packard chief executive Meg Whitman, former General Motors chief Dan Akerson and Jim Cicconi, who served in both the Reagan and Bush White Houses before becoming head of AT&T's Washington office.
Given Hanger's stance, Wagner told a Republican group last week that he believes Medicaid expansion will happen, so he wants to get engaged to make the plan as conservative as possible.
The Bipartisan Policy Center holds an event on federal science funding.
In general, the individuals most likely to endorse harm against political opponents (whether in their own or the other party) hold strong partisan loyalties; see the other party as an existential national threat; or have aggressive personality traits.
It's language like that that makes me kind of concerned and worried, Booker said of Barr arguing stiff drug charges were an effective way of combating violent crime.
Under Buttigieg's plan, which he detailed in September, anyone would be allowed to buy a government-backed public option plan on the individual marketplaces with benefits at least as generous as the private plans sold there. This public option would probably be cheaper than private plans because the government would have more leverage to pay doctors and hospitals lower rates.
The adults face civil penalties of $1,000 if an officer upholds the summons at a hearing, Lena writes. Health officials identified three children who were exposed to the severe respiratory virus but were not yet vaccinated by April 12, in violation of the order. Failing to appear at the hearing or respond to the summons will result in a $2,000 fine but city authorities have said they will not face criminal prosecution.
-- A strange Russian spacecraft is shadowing a U.S. spy satellite, a U.S. military commander told Time. This underscores a growing threat to America's dominance in space-based espionage and a potentially costly new chapter in Washington's decades-long competition with Moscow. Gen. John 'Jay' Raymond, commander of the newly minted U.S. Space Force, says the Russian spacecraft began maneuvering toward the American satellite shortly after being launched into orbit in November, at times creeping within 100 miles of it. 'We view this behavior as unusual and disturbing,' Raymond says. 'It has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space.' Raymond says the U.S. government has expressed concern to Moscow through diplomatic channels.
Without getting into the political blame game here, where are the national Republicans' plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this? If you talk to people in this state, they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle. So why haven't GOP candidates done more or talked more about this?
I think he's going to be a viable leader of the Republican Party, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. He's very popular. And he's going to get acquitted.

Republicans say the new formula now takes into account population and unemployment, whereas before it was based only on population. As a result, California will get $5 billion more and New York will get $2 billion more than under the old formula, Republicans say.
In tweets posted after 10 p.m. Tuesday, Trump expounded on the virtues of the system. Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College, he wrote. It's like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to just the large States — the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power — & we can't let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.

The Yemen vote, which tees up another Senate vote to end the Yemen intervention, could have long-term political implications. But as Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris report, the GOP's anti-Semitism language got a lot of the buzz; it's part of a mostly successful strategy to introduce motions to recommit, getting a vote on Republican priorities even while Democrats run the House. Each of those motions have attracted a rump of Democratic support.

-- OMB chief Mick Mulvaney claimed falsely that the Obama administration was manipulating jobs data to make the unemployment rate look smaller than it actually was. What you should really look at is the number of jobs created, Mulvaney told CNN's Jake Tapper. We've thought for a long time, I did, that the Obama administration was manipulating the numbers, in terms of the number of people in the workforce, to make the unemployment rate -- that percentage rate -- look smaller than it actually was.
With Trump nearing the end of his third year as president, it's time for an update — and a reality check. Contrary to what he tells his fans, Trump has broken more key promises than he has kept. With our latest update, Trump has broken about 43 percent of 60 key promises — and kept about 35 percent. He settled for a compromise on 12 percent.
That's not a question at which the HCCI researchers looked. But their study did find there's a lot of potential for savings if the most expensive hospitals can be induced to bring prices closer to the median.

Yet here's an important piece of context to keep in mind, one that PBMs are likely to share with senators tomorrow: It's the pharmaceutical makers who pocket by far the largest share of gross revenue from drug sales.

Republican leaders are trying to preempt that by diminishing the CBO's credibility, even though the office is led by an economist who was hand-picked by Republicans. I love the folks at the CBO, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday on This Week. But sometimes we ask them to do things they're not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isn't the best use of their time.
This talking point is based on a budgetary quirk — the Congressional Budget Office originally said that in the fiscal year that ends this September, only about $6.4 billion in outlays would be spent out of the total budget authority of nearly $129 billion. (The CBO estimates the impact of bills over 10 years.) This new money would be on top of $71 billion already allocated to schools in two previous bills, much of which is unspent, according to the CRFB. Many schools already had sufficient money for this year and next, Goldwein said.
Over the past decade in particular, Democrats have further embraced abortion rights as a central part of the party's platform — a shift that can be credited in large part to Planned Parenthood's increased prominence under Richards, Ruby and Ema write.

But comparisons between this emergency measure and the New Deal or Great Society are strained to the point of silliness. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson established new federal roles in retirement security and health care, which were fulfilled by vast new federal bureaucracies.

Colby Itkowitz reports: Trump, alongside [Netanyahu] for an event on the [Middle East peace proposal] acknowledged Pompeo in the audience. Pompeo received a round of applause. 'Very impressive, Mike,' Trump said, jovially. 'That reporter couldn't have done too good a job on you yesterday. I think you did a good job on her, actually.' Trump was referencing a confrontation Pompeo had with [Kelly] after an interview in which she asked him why he did not do more to defend Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine … [Pompeo] proceeded to curse and yell at Kelly for asking about Ukraine … [He] did not apologize for his treatment of Kelly.
Measles outbreaks have sprung up in nine other states this winter, but officials are particularly alarmed about the one in Clark County because of its potential to go very big, very quickly, Lena writes in this extensive look at the dangers of this outbreak.
Mueller through September 2018 had reported $25.2 million in costs. Presumably, this figure will rise when the final costs are released. But Mueller also made money for the government, namely by seizing properties owned by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Independent journalist Marcy Wheeler has estimated the value of Manafort's seized assets at $46 million.
By the way, it was a sign of the respect around Washington for Tanden's policy chops that even though she had been passionately committed to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign during the bitter Democratic primary in 2008, she was one of the very first Clinton campaign staff members that Barack Obama asked to join his general election effort. Obama saw in her what I hope some Republicans will see: a gifted and practical thinker about policy and how to make government work.
On an afternoon call with donors to his Team Ryan political organization, he continued: We're not going to just all of a sudden abandon health care and move on to the rest. We are going to move on with rest of our agenda, keep that on track, while we work the health-care problem. . . . It's just that valuable, that important.
Van Hollen ultimately won a third of the black electorate, which, combined with his strength among white, wealthier, older and more-educated voters catapulted him to the lead.
It's an important date, because several dozen insurance counties are in danger of having no insurer at all next year unless more enter. Washington state announced earlier this week that an insurer is entering the market in one of its two endangered counties, but large portions of Iowa, Ohio and Missouri may lack marketplace options.
I like what he's doing more than what he's saying frequently, McConnell told The Washington Post in an interview Thursday. So I kind of draw a distinction between his desire to comment on a lot of things, seemingly on a daily basis, and what we're actually trying to accomplish here.
Warren and Klobuchar are the last two women standing in the top tier of presidential contenders. Four years after many voters were disappointed that Hillary Clinton didn't become the first female president, the two senators are still in the hunt. They're fighting for a bronze ticket out of this pivotal early state and the chance to take on President Trump in November. But they're taking divergent approaches that go beyond their ideological differences in an attempt to gain the upper hand.
• Lower the eligibility age for Medicare, government health insurance for the elderly, to 60 from 65.
At first, Barr declined to adopt the president's preferred term.
While polypharmacy is growing, it's not always promoting good health and longevity in patients, said study author Dima Qato. As a pharmacist, when a patient comes in and reports depressive symptoms, I just think it's really important to think about what other medications they are on.
There are other estimates, as well, such as a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said 27 percent of adult Americans younger than 65 have health conditions that would likely leave them uninsurable if they applied for individual market coverage under pre-ACA underwriting practices that existed in nearly all states. This number is more conservative in part because the survey did not have enough detail on some illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS) that before Obamacare would have left someone without insurance.
The Biden administration has also reopened sign-ups for health insurance. Americans can enroll in the Affordable Care Act marketplace from Feb. 15 through May 15.
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
It's that very, very narrow path, Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel broadcast Friday. But I think we're going to get there.
Let's take a close look at three of Trump's claims.
Jan. 10. The House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity holds a hearing on Home Loan Churning Practices and How Veteran Homebuyers are Being Affected on
Republicans suggest it is somehow improper or unpatriotic for critics to point out the administration's failures in its handling of coronavirus. They say Democrats should stop trying to capitalize on Republican health-policy screw-ups. To that Democrats should simply reply, as Republicans have in the past: Well, then stop screwing up.
Pete Buttigieg launched his campaign one year ago yesterday. A senior adviser marveled at how far he's come:
CRUZ: ... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?
A similar refrain occurred throughout the 2016 campaign. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), beginning at last year's congressional GOP retreat, crafted a conservative agenda under the banner Better Way. Republican candidates regularly found themselves being asked to respond to Trump's comments, such as his promise to ban Muslims or his accusation that a federal judge from Indiana handling a lawsuit against him carried an unfair bias because he's a Mexican American.
With only one exception, they did.
If Owens prefers the GOP platform, then, certainly, she should support it. But as Rolling Stone's Jamil Smith points out, Contrarianism is a much lesser goal than iconoclasm, and much easier to achieve. Calling other people victims, or slaves, isn't an argument about the proper size and scope of government. It's not a defense of a foreign-policy doctrine. It's not an anti-choice argument. And it's not a coherent (or, for that matter, conservative) explanation for police brutality.
Candidates lower in polls can make the stage if they have 65,000 individual donors, at least 200 each from 20 states. That's the most radical new rule; in the past, it could have kept multiple candidates, such as 2008 also-ran Mike Gravel, off the stage entirely, as he never hit the old polling threshold or the new donor threshold.
Abortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done.
Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I've been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years. So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves. This is a radical Sunni movement. They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs. But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes. And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.
Powell, whom Trump nominated for the Fed chairmanship, is the kind of independent-minded person you expect to see named to a job like that. Trump has said frequently that he now regrets having nominated him.
The most obvious is to share vaccine doses with the rest of the world — both for humanitarian and diplomatic reasons.
There are two other more low-profile examples of this at the state level. One is former senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who was the only Republican to vote against Trump's tax cut package.
Cummings spotlights security clearances as one of several areas on which he cannot get answers: The White House argues that Congress is not entitled to any information about individual employees, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his communications with the Russians; current national security adviser John Bolton, who worked directly with the gun rights group founded by now-convicted Russian spy Maria Butina; or the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was reportedly given access to our nation's most sensitive secrets over the objections of then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and others. Instead, the White House offered to let us read — but not keep — a few pages of policy documents that have nothing to do with the officials we are investigating, along with a general briefing on those policies during which they will answer no questions about specific employees.
-- DHS has detected possible cellphone surveillance technology in the Washington area. Matt Zapotosky reports: [DHS] has not been able to pinpoint who or what is causing it, the department revealed in a letter released Tuesday. The technology, a cell-tower simulator commonly known as a StingRay, has been deployed for years by federal and local law enforcement to pinpoint suspects' locations, though its unauthorized use in the Washington area raises fears that foreign adversaries might also be taking advantage of it to spy on U.S. citizens.

* THE BIG COURT FIGHT IS STILL TO COME: Legal observer Benjamin Wittes has a good piece explaining that, while Thursday's court decision was probably right to keep a hold on Trump's travel ban, the bigger underlying dispute still lies ahead:
What we want to do is create a strong VA that offers veterans a good choice, but not be their only choice, Caldwell said. We want to give veterans the option to vote with their feet.
The Committee will continue its longstanding oversight of federal efforts to respond to emerging foreign infectious disease threats, the trio said in a joint statement. We have asked the CDC to provide us a full briefing on the scope of this Ebola outbreak, the challenges it faces in trying to contain it and how public health agencies are working to address it.
Even Republicans were against the policy. In Quinnipiac University and CNN polls, about two-thirds of Americans said they were opposed to the policy, including a third of Republicans.
Democrats were quick to criticize the apparent CMS decision. This appears to be yet another step by the Trump administration to undermine health care markets, which means higher premiums for families and those who need health care the most, said top Senate Finance Democrat Ron Wyden.
It's a variant of what I was talking about with the universities. But this is actually the big problem in American life. And I'm going to extend it to you all as journalists. Almost 2,000 local newspapers have gone out of business in the last number of years. Why? Because all of the advertising revenue went to the Internet. The local businesses that used to advertise in those papers disappeared. They got zeroed out. Did journalism become less valuable during this time? Well, yes, according to the marketplace, like the marketplace says, it's where zero then is where zero. And the theme of my campaign is, of course, journalism is not worth zero just because the market says it's worth zero. You need journalism to have a functioning democracy. How are you going to vote on things going on in your community if you don't have a local paper? So this is what's going on with politicians is that politicians have very, very clear institutional incentives and then they go to them. It's like the marketplace for politicians. What are their upside for seeming like a human being? Actually quite low because at some point they're going to say something that someone doesn't like, and then everyone will mock them and there'll be a negative press cycle, and their staff will be like, You can never do that again. Or then what are your incentives for like staying on the straight and narrow?
An Atlantic editor analyzed Glenn Beck for falling under the spell of Trumpism:
Currey Cook, an attorney with Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBTQ communities, said No one in this is saying faith-based providers don't have a place in the child welfare system. It's great they are a part of it. What we are saying is that if you are accepting government funds and performing a government service, you should not be able to discriminate against people with those dollars.
As for the nation's nonprogressive tax system, a significant portion of blame lies with the court's unraveling of campaign finance laws starting in the 1970s: These decisions rely on the dubious claim that money is speech and therefore deserves constitutional protection. The court's rulings gave more political power than ever to the rich, who used that influence to drive down their own tax rates.
The SPJ's Seaman acknowledged that many news organizations are owned by large corporations with other interests and businesses. So setting restrictions on press access by a parent company may open a proverbial can of worms, he said.
The friction led to a rift between Shulkin and White House officials. Selnick and Caldwell said Shulkin was speaking out of both sides of his mouth — telling the White House and CVA he supported their plan, while telling other senators and traditional veterans groups the opposite.
In terms of -- you know, Mitt Romney's a great guy, but he doesn't determine my strategy. The fact of the matter is I'm running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.
Dingell believed the new Democratic-led Congress should use its subpoena power and all the other tools in its toolbox to hold Trump administration officials accountable in 2019. If we really want to make America great again, we need to start by hauling their a--es up to Capitol Hill in front of truly bipartisan oversight committees and make them swear to tell the truth under penalty of perjury, he wrote. Believe me, it works. I've seen the wet spots on the chairs after they've finished testifying.
Sen. Ben Cardin (Md.) has said he'd be prepared to eliminate the filibuster, but I don't think you have the votes in the Senate to do it.
We have got to change the center of gravity for the Democratic Party, Ryan said.
Meanwhile, scientists are working at record pace to get a vaccine ready to work against the coronavirus. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are working with a Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna, and hope to have a vaccine ready for human testing by April, our Post colleague Carolyn Y.

Establish a Commission on Radical Islam that will include reformist voices in the Muslim community and will identify the warning signs of radicalization, educate the American public, and develop protocol for police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. (Fact check)
You have to do the waste, fraud and abuse. There is tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, Trump said on Fox Business, explaining what he would be able to cut. But Trump's understanding of the system's waste has seemed wildly off. In a March debate, Fox News's Chris Wallace caught Trump promising to save $300 billion from a Medicare program that only spends $78 billion in the first place.
Here's how Romney and Trump's relationship has evolved.
I've become friends with so many. But Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy, lost his son so violently. Say just a few words about your child.

CRUZ: ... abusing (ph) American workers...
-- Powerful earthquakes in Puerto Rico have left the already fragile territory in a blackout with reports of injuries and at least one death. Cristina Corujo, Arelis R. Hernández and Samantha Schmidt report: Powerful earthquakes this week, including a major 6.4-magnitude temblor early Tuesday morning, triggered widespread power outages and damage, leaving an already fragile Puerto Rico reeling once again. Schools, homes and churches along the southern coastline crumbled. Hospitals evacuated patients. A signature tourist attraction collapsed into the sea. At least one person died, crushed by a wall that toppled in his home. Tuesday's earthquake followed a 5.8-magnitude quake on Monday and was among numerous seismic events along an underwater fault line in recent days. All of them sent shock waves across the U.S. territory amid fears that further tremors could knock out key infrastructure. … Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced declared a state of emergency Tuesday and said authorities were evaluating the damage and inspecting Puerto Rico's power generation plants — all of which are located along the southern coast near the origin of the seismic activity. She also told government employees to stay home, as more aftershocks are expected. …
Democrats have been accused of being for open borders, and they must rebut that accusation, which is inaccurate, said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist who advised Clinton's 2016 campaign on immigration issues. Democratic candidates should be articulating what their reasoning is for smart and effective border enforcement.
Of course I'll commit to studying, Barr said, arguing that in the early 1990s, he had been trying to help black communities achieve a reduction in crime, but had recognized that the heavy drug penalties . . . have harmed the black community and the incarceration rates in the black community.
And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe.
I think health care's going to happen, Trump said. You're going to have a lot of exciting things over the next few months.
Just as Trump vowed to demolish Obamacare, as former president Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement is known, Biden, who was Obama's vice president, promised during the 2020 campaign to strengthen and build on the health-care law.
The violence at the Capitol appears to have companies scrambling to figure out how to react, as they increasingly realize that this is not an ordinary political dispute and the option of sitting on the sidelines grows increasingly unsatisfying, The Post's Todd C. Frankel and Jeff Stein report.
— And here are a few more good reads:
In 2015, Cruz called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a liar on the Senate floor over a debate on the Export-Import Bank . It was a shocking breach of decorum in the traditionally stuffy Senate.
As a sign of how quickly fortunes shift in Trumpworld, Sasse's victory is actually credited as an endorsement win by Ballotpedia. Why? Because in 2019, Trump said this about the senator.
And while public health officials say the initiative has raised awareness about mental health concerns, the city is still facing challenges in addressing mental illness. More New Yorkers dialed 911 to report a person in the midst of a mental health crisis last year — 179,000 calls — than at any point in more than a decade, J. David writes.
The Title X program is important to this administration, Valerie Huber, the HHS official currently in charge of the program, wrote in an email to clinics, per the AP. We are committed to the women and men who depend on Title X services and efforts are already underway to ensure that there will be no gaps in service while the funding announcement is finalized.
Behind the scenes, he was not being supportive, Selnick said.
The federal appeals court judge, whose Supreme Court nomination was blocked by Republicans in 2016, has a reputation for being a moderate and a unifying force on the appeals court, The Post's Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Ann E. Marimow report. As a judge, he frequently sided with the Food and Drug Administration and other public health agencies on health-related cases. In a 2013 case, he helped uphold the Drug Enforcement Administration's refusal to reclassify medical marijuana. Some court observers say that this ruling reflected his deference to agency decision making more than any particular agenda related to marijuana prohibition.
[House bill to undo Obamacare is more about shrinking Medicaid]
Some of the proposals in the presentation, which was the most specific health-care discussion yet among the 52-member Senate GOP Conference, would amount to a less aggressive assault on the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, than a bill that passed the House last month.
At some level, this disconnect between economics and politics reflects the underlying strength of the U.S. economy — the innovation, the efficient use of labor and capital, the quality of management — that existed long before Donald Trump became president. Business and economic fundamentals don't change overnight.
This is more important to me than the USMCA, Trump said Thursday, using an acronym for the updated trade deal.
Without further ado, and before we pick out interesting things to look for, here's what was said. Some benchmarks to keep in mind:
—A single pharmacy in the 1,779-person area of Mount Gay-Shamrock, W.Va. received more than 16.5 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills between 2006 and 2016. That averages out to 927 pills per person, per year.

Bloomberg said he discovered that stop-and-frisk had gotten out of control and then ramped it down, yet he continued to defend the policy for years after leaving office, disowning it only days before he joined the presidential race in November. His administration was buffeted by lawsuits challenging the practice, and a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way New York police officers were conducting the stops was unconstitutional. It was in the face of those legal challenges that New York reduced stop-and-frisk actions under Bloomberg.
In 2001, he married Kimberly Greenleaf. In addition to his wife, survivors include two children, Emerson Hanna and Grace Hanna, all of Barneveld, N.Y.; and three sisters.
Bruenig, of the People's Policy Project, notes one key selling point of a single-payer system is it spares physicians the reams of paperwork they have to do under the current system for private insurance companies. If America's physicians could reduce their administrative costs to Canadian levels, he said, health care spending would fall by well over 11 percent. (Canada has a single-payer health system.)
McConnell prefers to judge the second version — and does so favorably.
Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together! (April 1 tweet)
-- Preet took a shot across the bow at New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo yesterday, whom he could theoretically challenge next year. From the New York Times: Not all of Mr. Bharara's public corruption inquiries led to criminal charges, most notably his sweeping examination of Mr. Cuomo's abrupt shutdown in March 2014 of an anticorruption commission that the governor had formed with great fanfare just nine months earlier. A Times investigation published in July 2014 showed that before disbanding the panel, known as the Moreland Commission, Mr. Cuomo had hobbled its work, intervening when it focused on groups with ties to the governor or on issues that might reflect poorly on him. But after an investigation that spanned more than a year, Mr. Bharara said in January 2016 that his office had concluded that 'absent any additional proof that may develop, there is insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime.' Yet the Moreland Commission was clearly not far from Mr. Bharara's mind. He posted this on his recently opened Twitter account yesterday:
Why was there no real competition? In part because the Republican Party nationally took steps to make sure there wouldn't be.
And they needn't look far to see how a poorly received health-care bill can haunt a party for years. Democrats paid big for theirs in 2010 and, arguably, in 2014, too.
Most affected by the Republican health plan would be parts of Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska, Tennessee and Oklahoma, where Obamacare insurance subsidies have been crucial in making high-priced insurance affordable. All five states went for Trump. Also hit hard would be parts of key swing states that backed Trump, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan…

Bingo. This is exactly the point. People can take issue with McCain for his politics. They can forever begrudge his style and, as Trump does, his decisive vote against the GOP's Obamacare repeal bill. But when you take that a step further and say he'll never be worthy of your regard, you're implicitly opting out of the bargain I described at the top. And it does send a signal to everyone, as in the time of Vietnam, that military service isn't something that inherently defines you as a person worthy of respect. It also degrades the attractiveness of service for would-be recruits.
Six of the seven senators who are seeking the Democratic nomination or seriously considering bids have signed on to a Green New Deal resolution from Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).

In the House, Republican support for expansion was limited, with more than half of the 51-member Republican caucus voting against. Even so, what GOP support was there represented an abrupt about-face in a chamber that has vigorously opposed expansion for the past four years.
Still, the number of deaths is staggering. About 50,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus in the past two weeks alone. The country is also starting to see the spread of new, more transmissible variants that have been implicated in surges of infections in the United Kingdom and South Africa.
Beyond the unverifiable claim about his administration's efforts, there is no such thing as a foreign virus. Viruses can emerge anywhere on Earth. The Spanish flu that emerged in 1918, killing 20 million to 50 million people, is believed to have started in the United States — the first case was reported here — though no one knows for sure, except that it almost certainly did not start in Spain.

Mr. Hanna did not seek reelection in 2016, but he made news by backing Clinton — the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state under Obama — over Trump, a real estate businessman and reality television star.
The total $291 million is for the fiscal 2020 budget. Additional funding is expected as part of the multiyear initiative.
First of all, let's remind ourselves of the narrow scope of the provision in the GOP bill. Originally, in an effort to keep people buying health insurance, the legislation had a requirement that people not have a lapse in coverage or they risk a 30 percent increase in premiums for one year. The bill that passed included an amendment that would allow states to seek waivers from this continuous coverage provision.
This latest group of test trials will continue to demonstrate the strength of community claims against the opioid industry and culpability of each defendant in court, the co-lead plaintiff attorneys said in a statement emailed to The Health 202.

Second: The truly scary possibility is a run on the dollar. If huge budget deficits subvert global confidence in the dollar — causing investors to dump the currency — restoring that confidence might require deep cuts in federal spending and steep increases in taxes.
Before heading to Michigan for a campaign rally on Thursday, Trump said that a team of Republican senators were working with him on a bill. He named Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as the point people on crafting the legislation.
President Trump said nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump:
Both the party and the bulk of its voters have moved markedly to the left since 2016, on issues including health care and the minimum wage.
Yet the movement he built came in parts. Its left wing did not want Sanders to withdraw in favor of former vice president Joe Biden, whose campaign drew an enormous boost from Wednesday's news. This part of the Sanders coalition was always more of a third party than a Democratic constituency.
The new university is also uniquely set in the poorest area of a nation still working to rebuild after a genocide and civil war in 1994. The 100-day bloodbath killed about 1 million people and devastated the country's health infrastructure, leaving Rwanda with the lowest life expectancy in the world, Sarah writes. The university embodies the global community's renewed commitment to Rwanda, after it failed to intervene against the genocide.
Barr acknowledged his past writings taking aim at gay rights groups Tuesday but insisted that he was firmly opposed to discrimination.
The group also is seeking to fundamentally change whose costs the government will pay for by restricting the number of veterans eligible for VA health care.
It feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act.

I'd be the last person who would say I was going to run government like a business, because they're two completely different things with different leadership styles. And anyone who thinks otherwise is a moron. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)
TRUMP: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.
Trump administration officials stressed the overall risk remains low, but there's been a notable shift in the White House tone.
The left is in an endless argument about how far to go on Medicare-for-All. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), citing the polls that have shown the highest support for the idea, is all-in for Medicare-for-All; many Democrats, even those who have co-sponsored the bill, argue that the bill is akin to the Green New Deal, shifting debate in the right direction but not a realistic goal in 2021.
The National Health Commission reported Friday that there are now more than 830 confirmed cases of infection, and reports of new cases continued to roll in from around the country: from Xinjiang in the west to Shandong in the east, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. A total of 8,420 were reported to be under observation. South Korean authorities confirmed Friday that a second person tested positive for the new coronavirus. … Japan also confirmed a second case, a man in his 40s from Wuhan who arrived in Japan on Sunday on a flight through Hong Kong. Other countries to have reported infections including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to a confirmed case in Washington state, Texas has reported a potential case of coronavirus in Brazos County, about 100 miles northwest of Houston. The patient contracted a respiratory illness within two weeks of traveling in Wuhan and is being isolated at home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Price, who served in the House until his confirmation last week and penned an ACA alternative plan, told members that Trump is all in on repealing the Obama-era law and replacing it concurrently. But he indicated that the House would take the lead in that process and did not endorse specific ­overhaul elements. He also gave only a broad overview of regulatory steps he would be taking as secretary to address turmoil in the insurance markets.
The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency on Jan. 30. (Reuters)
The pharmaceutical giant submitted its vaccine to U.S. regulators after a global trial showed it to be effective at preventing serious illness and death from the coronavirus. FDA officials said that outside experts will discuss the vaccine in a meeting on Feb. 26, Carolyn Y. Johnson and Laurie McGinley reports.

Sanders defended his Castro comments during last night's CNN town hall. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing, he said. I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world — including Cuba, including Nicaragua, including Saudi Arabia, including China, including Russia. I happen to believe in democracy, not authoritarianism. … But can anyone deny — I mean, the facts are clear — that [China has] taken more people out of extreme poverty than any country in history? When pressed on Castro's legacy, he responded, Truth is truth. All right?
The president also endorsed Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.), who called on Trump to drop out of the 2016 presidential race after the Access Hollywood tape emerged, in her primary runoff:
TRUMP: So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into LaGuardia Airport, it's like we're in a Third World country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Democrats would subpoena Bob Mueller if the special counsel's report isn't made public. Felicia Sonmez reports: Schiff said on ABC News's 'This Week' that Democrats will also subpoena Mueller's report and are prepared to go to court against the Trump administration. With Mueller's nearly two-year investigation believed to be coming to an end, Democrats are seeking to ramp up pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr to release the full findings of the report — and setting down a marker for what course they will take if he doesn't. … Rumors swirled last week that the report could be delivered before the end of the month. But a senior Justice Department official said Friday that the report will not be coming this week.

The White House official pointed to an article in Politico that said an analysis indicated that insurers in 2017 started making money on the exchanges. The article looked at the filings of 29 regional Blue Cross Blue Shields plan with a simple formula of gross premium receipts minus medical claims. This it is not same as the medical loss ratio, in which 80 cents of every premium in has to be spent on medical care with the other 20 percent spent on administrative expenses (including cost of processing claims), federal, state and local taxes, all salaries, marketing, and so forth.

-- The Los Angeles Police Department suspended more than a dozen officers after a boy was wrongly labeled a gang member. From the New York Times: The Los Angeles Police Department opened an investigation early last year, when a mother in the San Fernando Valley approached a local police station to tell officers about a letter she had received saying that her son, a minor, had been identified as a gang member. She told a supervisor that he had been mislabeled, the Police Department said in a statement on Tuesday. … When the supervisor reviewed body camera footage and car recordings, they did not match the documentation completed by an officer, according to the department. Over the following months, the investigation grew to encompass more than a dozen officers in the elite metro division who were suspected of misrepresenting information in field interview cards, the Police Department said. … But the issues with incorrectly labeling people gang members extend far beyond falsifying field notes, according to Sean Garcia-Leys, a lawyer at the Urban Peace Institute. He said he had had dozens of clients over the past two years who had been wrongly added to CalGang.

The Supreme Court's decision essentially short-circuits the decision about the need for further lower court review, and the justices will make such decisions on their own.
A local advocacy group, DC Area Transmasculine Society, or DCATS, wants to fix this issue.
QUESTION: So, it's in the paper today that the president-elect finds the border adjustment provision in the House plan too complicated. Does that mean he's completely against it, that the bill can't go forward without it, or is there room for discussion? Because Paul Ryan's team is already on the record saying that they are very much committed to the border adjustment tax.
What would O'Reilly get in return for his money? First off, a tax system that is not all that different from the U.S. tax system for top earners, and arguably a little less favorable. The effective top Irish income tax rate is a little over half of income.
Unfortunately, Democrats turned their backs. The bill found only Republican sponsors. Democrats preferred a one-sided alternative, passed in the House in May 2019, that would expand LGBT protections while narrowing existing religious-liberty protections. That option appeals to progressive purists, but it has zero chance of Senate passage, and the conservative Supreme Court majority might gut it anyway. By endorsing the Fairness for All Act, Biden would swing Democratic firepower behind it. He would demonstrate that he is committed to advancing nondiscrimination while also addressing the concerns of the faithful. He would signal that he is serious about uniting the country. He would show that the vital center is back in business. Last and not least, he would make millions of Americans — gay and straight, secular and religious — better off. Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Moderate Democrats, however, welcomed what they considered a politically pragmatic response, especially with no bipartisan support for impeachment and Republicans controlling the Senate, which would have to convict Trump to remove him from office, per DeBonis and Bade.
Despite this scene in the book, Trump's Twitter feed and past news reports show that he knew Boehner.

Unemployment insurance is a federal program, but each state administers it for its residents. Many states were unprepared for the rush, which caused websites to crash repeatedly and forced people to call dozens of times a day to try to get through.
If this package was not a progressive wish list, why does it spend hundreds of millions of dollars on pet projects in New York City and in San Francisco like bridges and trailways?
On the transition website, the first two lines in a set of bullet points say that the Trump administration will protect health-care workers from being required to perform services that violate their religious or moral beliefs and that it will protect innocent human life from conception to natural death. Neither had figured among the campaign's health-care positions.
Federal appeals court appointments President Trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.
Ten years to the day before Trump's impeachment trial began, the Supreme Court released its Citizens United decision, plunging the country into the era of super PACs and unlimited, unregulated, secret campaign money from billionaires and foreign interests. Citizens United, and the resulting rise of the super PAC, led directly to this impeachment. The two Rudy Giuliani associates engaged in key abuses — the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the attempts to force Ukraine's president to announce investigations into Trump's political opponents — by allegedly contributing funds, some of disguised origins, to the president's super PAC and other U.S. campaign entities. Their ties to foreign sources of funds have been under investigation by federal prosecutors.
-- Tomorrow's timing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) tells reporters that Saturday's session will likely start and end earlier than the past few days. Party leaders are still trying to negotiate a deal to start the day as early as 8 a.m. so they can wrap up by noon. This would allow Democratic presidential candidates to fly to Iowa for campaign events. The trial has started at 1 p.m. during the week so that Chief Justice John Roberts can participate in pre-scheduled Supreme Court oral arguments before crossing the street to preside over the trial in the Capitol.
-- Trump does not appear ready to fire his embattled EPA administrator. From Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey: Trump appeared to stand by his EPA chief, voicing support for a man who has also proven adept at delivering on the president's campaign promise to aggressively roll back environmental regulations. 'I hope he's going to be great,' Trump replied, when asked by reporters whether he still supports Pruitt. Monday night, according to senior administration officials, Trump had called and told him, 'Keep your head up, keep fighting. We have your back.' Other Cabinet members have lost their jobs over controversies like Pruitt now faces, and history suggests that Trump's support for him could change any day. Some close to the president say Pruitt is unpopular among senior White House aides and many of Trump's friends.

Even after accounting for that growth, the deficit in the federal budget would increase by $1.9 trillion over the same 10-year period, CBO estimated. In a nutshell: While Trump's tax cuts would generate net economic activity, the government would not reap as much revenue as it did under the previous, higher tax rates, the CBO analysis found.
On Wednesday January 6, many members of the House community were in protective isolation in room located in a large committee hearing space, Brian Monahan, the attending physician to Congress, wrote in an email that was sent to members of Congress on Sunday morning. The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others. During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection.

Trump was asked several times about whether his campaign had contact with Russia and grew testy as reporters pushed him for a yes-or-no answer.
We think this package should have been negotiated on a bipartisan basis, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Instead, the new administration made a conscious decision to jam us.
One change would provide substantial ACA subsidies to anyone who is receiving unemployment insurance. The other would raise federal subsidies for COBRA, which tends to be expensive. The proposal would provide subsidies amounting to 85 percent of premiums through that program.

They signed up. They paid $15,000 for this course. They were asked for additional money for this course. If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.
On Saturday night, Trump encouraged his millions of Twitter followers to watch Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro, who said during her program that Ryan should resign as speaker. Ryan presided over a failed effort that allowed our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that, she said.
Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.
Unable to resolve the conflict, the legislature adjourned March 10 without passing a two-year budget. The state needs a spending plan in place by July 1 to avoid a government shutdown.

Get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations such as churches from formally endorsing or opposing political candidates. (Despite Trump's claims to he contrary, the Johnson Amendment is still on the books.)
2. Democrats set the agenda by moving first and staying united
Road to nowhere: The Florida Republican with presidential ambitions wouldn't comment on whether he'd support a Trump comeback bid in four years, saying it was a hypothetical. But after conceding Trump shares some of the responsibility for Jan. 6 siege, he believes it's up to voters — and not the Senate — to decide whether Trump deserves another chance.
Instead of corporations pushing and prodding politicians, politicians were pushing and prodding corporations, a kind of reverse lobbying that sometimes gets pretty rough. In 2009, Republicans were furious when Tauzin, as head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, struck a deal with the White House to support President Obama's health reform bill in exchange for a promise not to set controls on drug prices. Tauzin recalls getting a letter from Speaker John A. Boehner telling me that we were selling out. Obamacare passed without a single Republican vote -- but not before Tauzin had been pressured by some of his members to resign.

6. Can any bills make it around the filibuster?
In December, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Mr. Bogachev and five others in response to intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia had meddled in the presidential election. Publicly, law enforcement officials said it was his criminal exploits that landed Mr. Bogachev on the sanctions list.… But it is clear that for Russia, he is more than just a criminal. At one point, Mr. Bogachev had control over as many as a million computers in multiple countries.… While Mr. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, searching the same computers for files and emails. In effect, they were grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme, sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves.
AHH: Many Democrats see Tuesday's special election for the seat of former Rep. Tom Price (R) -- now secretary of Health and Human Services -- as intertwined with their health-care moves, my colleague Bob Costa writes. If Democrat Jon Ossoff wins the Georgia 6th Congressional District, the likely wave of enthusiasm could rattle Trump and Republicans. If he loses to Republican Karen Handel, it could be demoralizing and reveal the challenges facing Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections, despite the GOP health-care proposal's unpopularity.
The Trump administration is litigating in the Supreme Court to wipe Obamacare off the books, which is probably why the president opposes special enrollment; it would increase the ACA's coverage numbers, making it even harder politically for the court to get rid of it. Instead, Trump has suggested that the $100 billion hospital rescue fund recently enacted by Congress be used to cover covid-19 treatment for uninsured people, which could cost up to $40 billion. That's a substantial chunk of a fund that hospitals need for other priorities. It also would seem to unfairly divert that rescue money from states that have expanded Medicaid and insurance marketplace enrollment to states that have been less generous.
Incoming coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients will oversee the team running vaccine distribution from the White House, which will include Bechara Choucair, the chief health officer for Kaiser Permanente, as the vaccine coordinator in charge of speeding up distribution.
YouGov administered the online survey to a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. adults in November 2017. The data was collected through the 2017 Cooperative Congressional Election Study led by Liz Salazar and Brian Schaffner, funded in part by the National Science Foundation. About three-quarters of respondents identified with (or felt close to) Democrats or Republicans. In this analysis, we exclude those who did not express any kind of party leaning.

I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
Bring back the nervous breakdown , by the Atlantic's Jerry Useem: The nervous breakdown was not a medical condition, but a sociological one. It implicated a physical problem — your 'nerves' — not a mental one. And it was a onetime event, not a permanent condition. It provided sanction for a pause and reset that could put you back on track. But as psychology eclipsed sociology in the late 20th century, it turned us inward to our personal moods and thoughts — and away from the shared economic and social circumstances that produced them.
Pelosi's guests to the address included Mattie Scott, a California chapter president at the Brady Campaign and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in last year's Parkland, Fla. shooting. They were just so saddened by the fact that he made no pass at it, no acknowledgment of it, while representing that he was talking about keeping American people safe, Pelosi said.

Top Trump administration officials insisted Sunday that the odds of passing health-care legislation when the Senate returns to Washington next week remain high, but others in the GOP charged that the bill's problems require more than a quick fix.
Eliminate the Clean Water Rule that defines the waters of the United States and gives added protection to tributaries that impact the health of downstream waters. (Trump rolled back large portions of the rule but didn't eliminate it entirely.)
Trump lauded two executive actions regarding immigration and border security, including building a wall along the border of Mexico. Again, the numbers appear to have little basis in reality. Just building the wall is estimated to cost as much as $25 billion — before annual maintenance costs.
Q. What did Henry VIII say as he tackled the rest of the spit-roasted boar? (Beverley Sharp)
In coming days, I'm told, the American Civil Liberties Union is likely to file a lawsuit that is designed to overturn the entire executive order. This lawsuit will be separate and distinct from the one that the ACLU filed over the weekend, which successfully blocked the deportation of people detained upon trying to enter the United States. The new lawsuit will try to get the entire executive order declared unconstitutional, on behalf of all of the people impacted by it.
These key themes from Trump's 2016 victory are emerging again as the pillars of his 2020 campaign, centered on a foreboding, populist message about the perils of lax immigration policies, socialist health-care plans and foreign economic threats. He has returned to similar subjects repeatedly throughout his presidency, helping him hold onto a strong base of Republican support.
Mark my words, they are rigging this thing, Eric Trump wrote on Twitter. Campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wrote something similar: Dems rigging it at the Iowa Caucuses!

OOF: Months after Trump said he ordered the Veterans Affairs Department to purchase a drug called esketamine, a novel antidepressant meant to treat those with the hardest cases of depression, the department had treated just over a dozen veterans nationwide with the drug, Stat's Megan Thielking reports.
And these days, regular rules is synonymous with a 60-vote filibuster in the Senate by the minority party (especially on a bill as controversial as health care). In 2017, that means 52 Senate Republicans would need at least eight Democrats to join them — which, under this bill, is about as remote a possibility as President Trump giving up Twitter.
In 2017, Underwood, now 32, had never run for office but had served as a policy adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services during the implementation of the law commonly known as Obamacare. Back home in the exurbs of Chicago, Underwood contemplated running for office and, once her Republican congressman voted to repeal the ACA, she knew her next move.
It's been nearly 13 months since Azar was confirmed as the Trump administration's second Health and Human Services secretary, after his predecessor Tom Price resigned following misuse of government funds. In that time, the former Eli Lilly executive has taken surprisingly aggressive action against the pharmaceutical industry, even as he's pursued a more predictable route for a GOP appointee in trying to roll back Affordable Care Act rules and advance restrictions on abortion.
I was on the phone a lot with Tanden during that battle because she was as invested as anyone in getting health insurance to as many Americans as possible. She had worked on the issue as a young staffer in the Clinton administration and again in the Obama administration.
But only one of the elements — the proposal to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour — resulted in a CBO estimate that jobs would be lost. The CBO said it would mean 1.4 million workers, just under 1 percent, would lose their jobs. (The CBO also found 17 million workers, or 10 percent of the projected labor force, would get higher pay.)
A mystery, just like a cat sealed in a box!
We're going to get rid of Obamacare, Trump said at Thursday night's campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. And I said the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
Hoping to avoid harsh crackdowns from lawmakers and policymakers, the drug industry is saying that insurers should kick in more to lower seniors' costs by passing along Medicare drug rebates. Alarmed by that idea, insurers are pointing the finger at pharmaceutical companies for hiking the base price of medications.
I'll wait . . . until I see more of what he's proposing before I comment, McMorris Rogers said.
The earliest-term baby known to survive was born at 21 weeks and 4 days of gestation, Ariana writes. The girl, born in San Antonio to Courtney Stensrud, weighed a mere 0.9 pounds. Her skin was see-through, her lungs underdeveloped, and her eyes unable to focus. Obstetric guidelines do not recommend doctors resuscitate in this situation, but Stensrud asked them to try. Writing in the journal Pediatrics in December 2017, her doctors reported she had grown in to a healthy 2-year-old toddler but cautioned that this doesn't mean all babies born at this stage of development could be saved.
The issue of toxic donors is even more complicated in the case of the Sackler family, which is worth an estimated $13 billion, Peggy writes. Its three branches and multiple generations are often — and, according to some descendants, unfairly — lumped together as a single entity.
We're putting together a package, I hope, that helps as many Virginians as we can, Wagner said in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday.
The next year, a freshman Democrat in the Montana House made a similarly grievous error. As Democrats pushed a bill to expand Medicaid coverage, Republicans tried a last-ditch tactical maneuver to keep it off the floor, where it was likely to pass. That's when Rep. Tom Jacobson cast the wrong vote, giving the GOP a surprise win — and keeping roughly 70,000 Montanans from gaining insurance coverage.
We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.
The Senate, envisioned by the founders to be a highly deliberative body, was created with no mechanism to end debate on a given topic. Senators quickly realized that long speeches could delay action on legislation they didn't like. In the 1850s, the practice of talking a bill to death got a name -- filibuster, from the Dutch word for pirate. In 1917, senators adopted a rule establishing that debate could be ended upon a so-called cloture vote supported by a two-thirds supermajority. That bar was lowered in 1975, when the Senate reduced to 60 the number of votes required for cloture.
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NATIONAL HEALTH-CARE DEBATE:
TRUMP: No, I'm a big defender of the Second Amendment. And if you look at what's happened, whether it's in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it's in Paris -- which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured. They will be dying. Many people will be dying in addition.
Increasingly, suicide is being viewed not only as a mental health problem but a public health one, Amy writes. Nearly 45,000 suicides occurred in the United States in 2016 — more than twice the number of homicides — making it the 10th-leading cause of death. Among people ages 15 to 34, suicide is the second-leading cause of death. Overall, the most common method used was firearms.
Sen. Scott is focused on what can get passed Congress this year, which is why his focus has been on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, Hartline said.
Castro talked about Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; the Fact Checker explains that here.
In many ways, the results are the opposite of the vision Ryan advanced during his tenure as speaker and as Romney's running mate. And the problems may be as big or bigger than they were when Ryan won the speaker's gavel in the fall of 2015, declaring, The House is broken. We are not solving problems. We are adding to them.
As Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) notes, under NAFTA there were zero tariffs on 100 percent of manufactured goods and 97.5 percent of agricultural products that crossed the three nations' borders. U.S. exports to Mexico increased 500 percent. The USMCA's constructive modernizations of NAFTA — the enormous digital economy did not exist in 1994 — are, Toomey says, mostly taken from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, and for that reason was anathema to Trump. His scrapping of the TPP was a gift to China.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said allegations of unwanted touching against former vice president Joe Biden don't disqualify him from the presidential race:
They're likely hoping to repeat that experience: Use big government now to cushion the worst of this recession even if it contradicts their ideology, then snatch those benefits away once a Democrat is in the White House and might benefit from them.
The nation's leading insurers, health providers and employer groups have laid out how they want universal coverage achieved.
Now, they could pay a political and procedural price for that. When the CBO estimated the impact of a different version of Republicans' bill in March, the bill lost so much support among House Republicans that leaders canceled a high-profile vote.
Looking toward the 2020 elections, McCarthy (R-Calif.) noted that several Freedom Caucus members lost and said that he was focused on recruiting candidates who would find a solution at the end of the day — noting that he was already wooing doctors, Navy SEALs and a former CIA agent to run.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) dropped his 2020 presidential bid on April 8, but many of his progressive policies remain a part of the Democratic conversation. (The Washington Post)
Some Trump boosters offer a more measured take on what has transpired, suggesting the drama in Washington will not be foremost on the minds of voters.
I don't really know what the value-add would be to have Social Security doing it, and I'm not sure it would be faster or more efficient, Gleckman said.
The White House's statement on the House GOP notably didn't include a statement of support, but rather paints the introduction of the bills as a step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare.
A December poll from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found 69 percent of all Americans are at least somewhat worried about climate change, up seven points from last March.
-- Trump continued his recent anti-immigrant tweets this morning:
In an interview on Fox News, Romney suggests that Trump is trying to hide something by not releasing his taxes.
Republicans have run up against all sorts of difficulties in building support for various plans to repeal and replace the ACA, but their opposition to the law's mandate has been a political winner for them, especially among the GOP base. A November Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 55 percent of the public supported getting rid of the mandate, while 73 percent of Republicans held that position.
After an impromptu reenactment of Billy Crystal's mostly dead scene in November, Cruz would occasionally do an encore performance when asked.
The IRS raced to stand up the stimulus program with a depleted staff. Overall, the agency had 76,000 employees last June, down from 99,500 in 2010. Dozens of experts in the agency's legacy computer systems have left or retired, current and former officials said. Starting in 2011, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought cuts to the IRS budget.
I would disagree with the premise of your question, that if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, that that's going to happen, Cotton said, drawing loud boos.
Certainly, the Supreme Court didn't create all these problems, but its rulings have worsened the pathologies — uncompromising views, mindless partisanship and vitriol — visible in this impeachment trial. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), no doubt recognizing that the Supreme Court's conservative majority is helping to preserve his party's Senate majority, has devoted much of his career to extending conservatives' advantage in the judiciary.
Although fiscally conservative, he was among the few Republicans who resisted pressure to sign a pledge, circulated by conservative activist Grover Norquist, to oppose any tax increase. I don't give out my vote to some guy named Grover, he said.
Northam has lots of friends in Virginia's GOP-controlled General Assembly, where the former senator and lieutenant governor worked so well across the aisle that Republicans once wooed him to join their party. Particularly in the Senate, where the mild-mannered pediatrician pulled practical jokes, played on the chamber's hapless basketball team and treated legislators stricken with flu, he enjoys goodwill that's sorely missing from politics just across the Potomac.
Also in attendance was Justice Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama, and all three of Trump's selections for the court: Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
Of course, there will be an epic legal battle to try to stop Trump from reversing the Clean Power Plan, and it could take years. Obviously a great deal is at stake.
A federal lawsuit last year highlighted how quickly the border situation can shift.
-- Inslee notes that he has made tangible, if incremental, progress as governor. Indeed, the Seattle Times Editorial Board praised him last month for trying to elevate the national conversation surrounding global warming and for his work to reduce emissions during six years as governor: Inslee has a compelling story to tell about the state's ability to grow its economy, increase education spending and host the nation's two most valuable companies — all while reducing emissions, increasing use of renewable energy and enforcing strong regulations to protect the health of forests, waterways and air quality. …
As we've seen time and again, when there's only one option on the market consumers can face exorbitant prices, Grassley said in a statement. Getting more options on the market, as this bill will do, can give consumers an option other than a single high-priced drug.
So, we're going to have details as we go further, but part of the, as I say, I mean, I guess the best way to suggest it is that he was impressed with the work and plans that Dr. Price had put out early-on, and I think that that's going to be something that he -- that's, I don't know whether you want to call that a starting point, but it's definitely a lot of ideas we found helpful.
Fred Hiatt: So, just to follow up on step two, essentially you're using tax expenditures to reward companies that improve education or health …
Allergic reactions to coronavirus vaccinations are rare and outweighed by the benefit of protection.
In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.
TRUMP: The -- the -- the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing. They take in a lot of people, because you can't get them. They take in a lot of people. Long-term employees, we don't do that, but short-term employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area. It is a very hot area.
KELLY: It has been going for five years.
In a sharp exchange with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) late in the afternoon, Barr seemed to sympathize with the president's characterization of Mueller's probe as a witch hunt, saying it was understandable someone who felt falsely accused might lash out at the investigation into their conduct.
Trump received a vaccination before leaving the White House but did not do so publicly, which leading infectious-disease doctor Anthony S. Fauci has said would have gone a long way in convincing vaccine-hesitant Trump supporters.
-- The Trump administration is moving ahead with its most deliberate effort yet to challenge accepted science on climate change and has chosen to do so in a way that will minimize transparency. The White House plans to create an ad hoc group of select federal scientists to reassess the government's analysis of climate science and counter conclusions that the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming the planet, Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Brady Dennis report. The National Security Council initiative would include scientists who question the severity of climate impacts and the extent to which humans contribute to the problem …
KELLY: ... Hold on, hold on, hold on...
Trump has wanted to attack George before, but he's been talked out of it by staff, who convinced him it would elevate Conway and cause drama in Kellyanne's home life, according to several current and former White House aides.
The most-discussed bill in the District would prohibit the sale of any flavored e-cigarette product, a policy adopted in other major urban hubs including New York City, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Advocates say banning flavors such as cotton candy and strawberry milk can dissuade young people from forming a nicotine habit, he adds.
Castro: Me llamo Julián Castro . . . On January 20, 2021, we'll say adios to Donald Trump.
For now, though, the odds still seem stacked against Warren or Klobuchar becoming their party's standard-bearer. Indeed, no modern Democrat has won the nomination without finishing first or second in New Hampshire.
But Biden could pose a possible obstacle to hospitals. While he supports policies, such as expanding Medicaid, popular with hospitals, he also left them completely out of his coronavirus relief proposal. And Xavier Becerra, Biden's nominee for health secretary, built a reputation as an enemy of hospital consolidation, after winning a half-billion-dollar antitrust settlement from a health system in California.
Expect Pelosi – along with Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone and Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott – to draw a sharp contrast today between the administration's approach to the marketplaces and their own. The measure they're introducing will propose rolling back the administration's expansion of short-term and association health plans and restore funding it had slashed to navigators who provide enrollment assistance for hard-to-reach groups.
12:40 p.m.: Barr cautiously sides with Trump in shutdown showdown, says 'it's imperative to have border security'
Rodriguez and Milliken entrenched inequality deeply in American education. The quality of the education that children receive today depends to a great extent on how much money their district has, and the gaps in funding among districts in a single state can be enormous. At the end of the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Education concluded that 6.6 million students in the highest poverty districts in 23 states were being fundamentally shortchanged by funding inequities. Those districts, the department found, spent 15.6 percent less than the lowest poverty districts – making an enormous difference in the quality of teachers, equipment, textbooks and other educational inputs a school can afford.
In 2008, a 9-year-old in Iowa asked her, Do you think your dad would be a good 'first man' in the White House? The child was a kid reporter for Scholastic News.
Gabbard, who has made ending regime-change wars a central part of her platform, warned that if the United States attacked Iran, the result would be a far more costly and deadly conflict than the war in Iraq.
Andrew Yang: I do get that.
I seek to live in a way that honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King and the entire King family. Not just on this special occasion, but every day, Kelly Loeffler reportedly told a congregation last January when she appeared at Ebenezer in honor of King.
The updated numbers on Monday are for cases as of April 18, Lena writes, but health officials are expecting another spike in cases because of the chances of increased spread during holiday gatherings over the weekend because of Easter and Passover.
Public health experts say that the key takeaway from the report is that the fit of the mask is crucial, although wearing any type of mask is still better than wearing none at all.
Medical costs in Alaska are particularly high, in part because so many people there live in remote areas.
Yes. Just as at any given time, a simple majority of senators could vote to end it for good, it could be modified in the same way. In fact, senators have limited its use twice in the past decade, both times in regard to confirmations of presidential appointments. In 2013, Democrats established that a simple majority vote could advance nominees for lower-court judgeships and federal agencies. In 2017, the Republicans who then held the majority voted to allow a simple majority vote to confirm Supreme Court nominees. So far, most legislation can still be filibustered.
How much should health insurance be disrupted?: Moderators asked which candidates support moving to a national health care system that would eliminate private insurance, and only Sanders and Harris raised their hands.
A December poll by the Pew Research Center asked about demographic trends that will make the country majority nonwhite by 2050. Among white respondents, 46 percent believed the shift would weaken American customs and values, compared with 23 percent who said it would strengthen them.
But neither the White House nor Republicans in Congress have offered a new plan to replace the comprehensive Obama-era law, which was passed nearly a decade ago and has grown in popularity since Trump was elected.
But the Senate, which does not face voters until 2019, did not budge.
As part of the acquisition, which closed in November, CVS promised to transform its stores and make customers healthier and to lower health-care costs, Angelica writes. The new services in the stores are available to all customers, not just Aetna members. One feature unique to some Aetna members is the type of care they receive at the pharmacy counter. Aetna identified about 100 patients who regularly come to the CVS store in Houston that will get a special consultation every time they pick up a prescription.
The insurance lobby would probably urge state officials to ask for waivers, because screening out the sickest applicants would allow insurers to bring down their costs. Advocates for patients and public health would oppose waivers, and if those groups prove to be politically weaker in red states, then it would be more likely that consumers with preexisting conditions in those states would pay more.
In the end, critics noted that for all Ryan's talk over the years, his record of accomplishments on the issues he discussed most often ended up being thin.
Dr. Schuchat — thank goodness you're back. You're amazing, thank you. I echo — Dr. Schuchat for director, added another poster.
But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.
That problem won't get better unless we upgrade the FDA's standards for approving new drugs. Drugmakers should be required to prove that new medicines improve the length or quality of life over and above existing treatments. Industry funding of the FDA — which began in 1993 and appears to have led to an increase in the approval of unsafe drugs — should end, and the agency should be fully publicly funded.
None of those proposals became law, and Trump has taken Medicare cuts off the table.
For those who say these landslide races were ages ago, and that Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan, fair enough. How about December 2019? That is when Sanders clone Jeremy Corbyn got routed by Trump clone Boris Johnson in the British parliamentary elections, sending the Labour Party to what some said was its worst defeat in more than 80 years. Corbyn, who Sanders predicted would lead his party to a resounding victory and should be a lesson for the Democratic Party, tanked. He literally repelled voters, former Labour MP David Milliband wrote after the debacle.
As Congress investigates the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) believes two things: The attack was domestic terrorism, and it showed law enforcement needs broader powers to fight back, like those granted after 9/11.
Trump wishes Sanders 'well' in his 2020 run:
As if to rub salt in the GOP's wound, Priebus hinted that Trump may simply start looking past the Republican majority and try forging more consensus with moderate Democrats in future legislative battles. Priebus pointed to the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group for heavily resisting the health-care bill.
Remember when President Obama said, 'If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance,' Bennet said during an interview on NBC's Meet to Press. And then a few people in America actually lost their insurance because of the way that the plan worked. Now what Democrats are saying is, 'If you like your insurance, we're going to take it away from you,' from 180 million people that get their insurance from their employer and like it, where 20 million Americans who are on Medicare Advantage, and love it. That seems like a bad opening offer for me.
Unlike the more partisan House, the Senate … has taken a bipartisan approach this year. The Agriculture Committee passed a version of the legislation embraced by both parties, and without the controversial food stamp changes in the House version; it's expected on the Senate floor next week. The two competing versions would ultimately have to be merged.
Lifelong Democrat, Kevin Smith, 40, said when I asked him why he'd voted for Clinton. But more importantly she was a better choice for — oh I don't know, the good of the Republic? We've gone beyond the 'good of the people' and the 'good of politics' to kind of existential threats to the Republic right now. Given who won.
Foolish Pleasure x Apollo = Schwing and a Myth (Jonathan Paul, Garrett Park, Md.)
They did in Iowa, certainly, as McDaniel and Trump's campaign ensured they would by boxing them out.
If the lawsuit moves relatively quickly through the 5th Circuit, it would be appealed to the Supreme Court by the end of the year. (An appeal is likely to happen whether the state attorneys general prevail or lose.) That probably means a high-profile legal fight over the ACA in early 2020, culminating with a decision in the summer, shortly before the national party conventions. After the bruising 2017 fight, the ACA has consistently enjoyed majority support for the first time in its existence.
I said, I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.
Some of the outreach hasn't gone especially well for the White House.
And a federal judge is expected to rule soon on the validity of the work rules in Arkansas.
2. The guy who arrives at his high school reunion in a rented Ferrari
Taken in combination, these actions have led many health care providers to perceive a significant category of vulnerable patients as institutional and professional liabilities to be contained or eliminated, rather than as people needing care, the letter to the agency reads.
Conway acknowledged that she has no evidence of the wiretapping allegations during a hit on Good Morning America a few hours ago:
Republicans in Idaho said the legislation is an effort to control spending. We need to put some sideboards on the expansion, Idaho House majority caucus leader John Vander Woude said, adding voters didn't understand the cost associated with expansion when they voted for it at the ballot. He said the referendum voters approved had no financing to show what it would cost… the best way to implement this is do it in a cost-effective way to get the results we are looking for.
TRUMP: I have employed tens of thousands of people.
5:35 p.m.: Barr says he sees 'no reason' to revise long-standing DOJ precedent that presidents cannot be indicted while in office
And speaking of her own childhood, she said: Regardless of what was happening in her life, she was always, always there for me.
He pushed back, accusing Trump's VA appointees of trying to undermine him. Traditional veterans groups attempted to defend Shulkin, whom they saw as a bulwark against further outsourcing of VA care.
In my view, additional witnesses are not necessary, said fellow Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The president was entirely justified in asking for an investigation of corruption concerning Ukraine and potentially Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.
I don't believe most people appreciate that we could end the world this afternoon, he said. It's really terrifying to think of this apparently mindless guy with his, as he says, thumb on the trigger.
But Noam reports the Trump administration deemed all the state Medicaid applications 'complete,' CMS documents show.
Medicare for All is the solution our country needs, the letter said. Patients, nurses, doctors, working families, people with disabilities and others have been telling us this for years, and it's time that Congress listens.
The United States should have 1.3 billion vaccine doses – if all goes according to plan.
Under Obamacare, millions of Americans have lost their jobs. Millions of Americans have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. That is happening all across this country, he said, noting that President Obama said the average family's health insurance premium would drop by $2,500.
-- The president is functioning again as his own acting White House communications director since former Fox News executive Bill Shine abruptly resigned on March 8. He appears to have identified the electoral college as an opportunity to bolster a broader narrative. In a tweet just after midnight, Trump linked calls for abolishing the electoral college to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's endorsement last week of lowering the voting age to 16, along with Democratic calls to enlarge the Supreme Court to 15 justices. He said Democrats are getting very 'strange.'
I wouldn't even triple vote, he said. I would move to Ohio or Michigan, register to vote and vote there, if I had to do all over again. That's what I would do.
During Barack Obama's presidency, Keller said, many evangelical leaders talked nervously of the future, but for different reasons than the ones that concern them now. Some were fearful that religious academic institutions could lose accreditation or federal funding because many do not hire openly gay staff members. And several colleges and universities, including Wheaton, sued the government over an Obamacare mandate to cover certain forms of contraception.
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all plans are popular concepts among Democratic voters, but she said they are not well-defined among the broader public.
-- Meanwhile, thought leaders on the left have effusively praised Schiff's performance. Esquire's Charlie Pierce calls Schiff the Daniel Webster of our time. Walter Dellinger, who was acting U.S. solicitor general under Bill Clinton, said Schiff offered one of the most impressive performances by a lawyer I have ever seen. MSNBC legal commentator Jason Johnson called Schiff's opening statement on Wednesday a speech that kids will be giving in 2060 at university projects. Actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who has been attending the trial, said it felt like you were watching a one-man show on Broadway.
— And here are a few more good reads:
Many of Johnson's complaints about the draft bill have been about McConnell's secretive process rather than the substance of the policies. He complained about the speed of the process and the lack of information on Thursday.
There are other steps the administration could take: A major one would be to end cost-sharing subsidies the law provides to lower- and middle-income people with marketplace plans to help pay their deductibles and co-pays, Amy and Juliet note. Another question is how the administration will handle the next enrollment season for ACA health plans, which will begin in November. The end of the most recent season coincided with Trump's first days in office, and the new administration yanked some advertising meant to encourage sign-ups. … While a set of federal essential health benefits, required of health plans sold to individuals and small businesses, will now remain in law, federal health officials could narrow what they require, limiting prescription drugs, for instance, or the number of visits allowed for mental-health treatment or physical therapy. … The administration also could take advantage of a part of the ACA that, starting this year, lets health officials give states broad latitude to carry out the law's goals.
OUCH: The Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarette start-up Juul and Altria, the country's largest cigarette maker, are going back on their pledges to combat youth vaping, an issue that's become a critical focus for commissioner Gottlieb.
Trump takes a misleading GOP talking point and hypes it up even more – that premiums went up to levels that nobody thought possible.
Trump on Sunday reiterated his commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act when asked whether he would rethink his administration's backing of a lawsuit to invalidate the health-care law. What we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care, said Trump, without specifying how he would replace the health-care law.
-- Saudi Arabia appointed its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar. Kareem Fahim reports: Her appointment, which was announced in a royal decree late Saturday, was the latest sign of the kingdom's effort to rehabilitate its image in the United States after U.S. lawmakers censured the Saudi leadership for the killing of [Post contributing columnist] Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, and the arrests and alleged torture of Saudi women's rights activists.
Force other NATO countries to pay for more of their defense, and only come to the aid of other countries if those nations have fulfilled their obligations to us. In particular, Trump expects Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the security the United States provides. (NATO funding has increased, and Trump has rocked the boat. But as Defense News reported, Under NATO commitments forged 2014 — two years before Trump took office, and coinciding with Russia's annexation of Crimea — each ally has until 2024 to reach their goal to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defense.)
We cannot be deterred from the work we need to do on our gun laws in New Zealand. They need to change, Ardern said Sunday, according to The Post's Anna Fifield
Despite Trump's tactical retreat on family separations this week, he continues to believe that immigration should be a defining issue of the 2018 elections and that it will galvanize the GOP base. This puts him at odds with most veteran Republican strategists, campaign managers and pollsters who think the party would be much better off focusing on the strong economy and the GOP tax cuts. But Trump believes he has superior political instincts than these experts and that his unexpected victory in 2016 proves it.
The latest complaint comes nearly three months after Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.
Concerned Veterans for America was formed in 2011 as a nonprofit group named Vets for Economic Freedom Trust, and was seeded with nearly $2 million from Koch network donors, tax documents show.
Trump's approach to lowering U.S. drug spending has been perceived as relatively soft on the pharmaceutical industry, at least compared to what he suggested on the campaign trail: Allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower drug prices through Medicare plans.
Bill Littlejohn, chief executive officer of the San Diego-based Sharp HealthCare system's fundraising foundation, told Phil the practice of having doctors speak with select patients about their experience led to 20 percent of patient donations there.
In the association's 17th annual State of Tobacco Control report, the Food and Drug Administration received an F rating mainly for lack of action, the report's author and the association's national director of policy, Thomas Carr, told CNN's Susan Scutti. He added the lack of effort, especially related to youth vaping, is putting the lives and health of Americans at risk. They've made a lot of announcements this [past] year, but there hasn't been a lot of concrete action, Carr added. Yes, there has been an investigation of [e-cigarette giant] Juul, but that hasn't led to a lot of meaningful policy change.
-- The Justice Department conceded that it had insufficient cause to continue monitoring a former Trump campaign adviser during the Russia probe. Matt Zapotosky reports: The concession was revealed in an order posted on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's website. In December, according to the order, the department told the court it had come to believe that in at least two of the four applications to monitor the former adviser, Carter Page, 'there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause' to believe he was acting as a Russian agent.
Unless you get the president to sign this thing or there is a veto override, the vote is symbolic, Amar told Power Up.  And once you know that, that plays into what the vote really means. Mitch McConnell m ight w hip his caucus and react a whole lot d ifferently if this vote mattered except as a testing vote to get people on the record for the 2020 election.
Bowing to pressure from some in his own party, Trump recently backed off a new pledge to take another crack at eliminating the ACA and said a vote on a GOP health plan — still unformed — would be delayed until after the 2020 election.
The Democrat from California has repeatedly praised Vindman and others for sticking their necks out to answer questions about the president's alleged Ukraine coercion campaign when his former bosses, including ex-national security adviser John Bolton, refused to come before the House. I have such admiration for the fact they did, Schiff said on Wednesday. But what would really vindicate that leap of faith … is if we show the same courage. They risked everything—their careers—and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.
Support among independents dropped from 52 percent in 2010 to 34 percent now.
Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
At the same time, they say that the bill would set aside funds to help those with preexisting conditions cover their increased costs. But independent analysts say the amounts in the bill that passed the House on Thursday will probably not be enough.
Business chose to ride with the Republicans, and now they have nowhere to go. It's a very precarious position, said Thomas A. Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader whom Republicans defeated in 2004 with strong support from business. Among Democrats, Daschle reports, there is a lot of resentment that's built up — disgust even — with the way so much of business migrated so comfortably to the far right.
Mike Leavitt, who served as HHS secretary under President George W. Bush, was among the first to raise the idea of such payment reforms, and his successors under President Barack Obama – former HHS secretaries Kathleen Sebelius and Sylvia Burwell – started serious efforts through ACA's innovation center.
My policy of not taking a dime from anybody shows a non-corruptibility that a lot of voters should want, he said. Somebody said to me the other day, 'You're spending a lot of money.' And I said, 'Yes, I'm spending an enormous amount of money trying to get rid of Donald Trump. Now, do you want me to spend more or less?' And he laughed and said, 'Oh, I had just not thought about it that way. Go spend more!'

Stephen Colbert broke down Pompeo's attacks on NPR:
Despite denials from Johnson & Johnson, plaintiffs in multiple lawsuits against the company allege it knew its products could cause cancer, The Post previously reported.
[They say] 'the economy is great, it is doing great for everybody.' And then you ask them, well, how is that? Well, they'll point to the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. Then you'll ask them, what's your other measure? And they'll talk about well, the unemployment rate is down. That's fine. Yeah, well, I've been traveling our country. People are working. They're working two and three jobs to pay the bills. It's not working for working people.
A business-friendly pragmatist who has served 17 years in the Senate and nine years in the House before that, Wagner ran unsuccessfully for governor last year on a promise to raise taxes for transportation. He finished a distant third in the GOP gubernatorial primary.
If any of that sounds confusing, welcome back to the politics of the Green New Deal. The left says it intended to start a debate, which is really all it could do without control of the White House and Senate. Republicans, alternately baffled and amused at the scope of the GND, ask why Democrats would introduce something never intended to pass.
So if we follow this through, I surprise in Iowa, perform extraordinarily well in New Hampshire, I become president of the United States in 2021, everyone would know that I won on the Freedom Dividend because that's my signature proposal. Americans decided that $1,000 a month in cash is pretty great. And so then as president, I'm there celebrating with Democrats and progressives because they're just thrilled we've beaten Donald Trump. They realized it was a bit of a bet, but it worked. And here we are.
On Obamacare, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) made a Kinsley gaffe — meaning he told an impolitic truth. The Huffington Post reports, Asked when Republicans might get down to the business of crafting an Obamacare alternative, Corker said he wasn't sure. 'I have no idea,' he said. 'I'm not on a committee that deals with this … but I don't see any congealing around ideas yet. And I think it's fine that we take our time. . . . I mean, we're dealing with something that is very important, very complicated. It's explosive if not handled properly, and we should take our time and do it right. Every email House Speaker Paul D. Ryan issues bragging that everything is moving ahead on replacing Obamacare makes me think not much of anything is happening. Corker makes sense when he warns about the perils of reconciliation:
Very low debt, tremendous cash flow. My financials are all -- they're all in there with the federal elections. You've seen them. Everybody has seen them. I say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit. Believe me.
That is a way to provide a public alternative that's real … so that we can bring down the rates, Klobuchar said. And then we can look at other options, but we have to start somewhere. And I think we could do that much more immediately.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accuses the GOP of sabotaging the health-care system:
Ivanka sometimes made fun of her father's hair, in private
The woman, assigned to a U.S. Special Operations task force in Iraq, was charged with turning over the names of human informants and other classified data to a Lebanese man with ties to the militant group Hezbollah. The Justice Department said Mariam Taha Thompson, 61, formerly of Rochester, Minn., was charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of delivering defense information to aid a foreign government. Prosecutors alleged that she passed the information to a man in whom she had a romantic interest, Spencer Hsu reports. Thompson appeared in federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The FBI arrested her Feb. 27 at a U.S. military facility in Irbil, Iraq, where she worked.
May 29. The Brookings Institution holds an event on medical marijuana in the United States on
TRUMP: Tapes were not on the subject, but that's...
-- The president's son Donald Trump Jr. published an op-ed in the Telegraph saying Theresa May should've taken his father's advice on Brexit. Since 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise. But Mrs May ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo. Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost … With the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead.
Trump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on the opioid crisis on Jan. 9.
Many of the evangelical leaders who will attend the meeting are caught in a generational divide. Their institutions tend to be fueled by an older generation of primarily white donors, many of whom are conservative and friendly to Trump's policies. However, the future of their institutions is worrisome because many younger evangelicals and the growing numbers of evangelicals of color are distraught by the perception that the movement has become so tied to Trump.
Peter, among others, saw Bush v. Gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, Caroline Fredrickson, president of the ACS, told me. The left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the Warren Court and all of the sudden we were going to have the Roberts Court. And so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the Constitution.
A House Republican lawmaker called Trump out on his immigration tweet yesterday morning:
Back in 2013, the expectation was that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives could force the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass — and compel President Barack Obama to sign — a repeal of his signature health-care initiative. This false narrative started with a few outside groups like Heritage Action and Tea Party Express arguing that the barrier to repealing Obamacare wasn't the president; it was elected Republicans who were unwilling to fight hard enough. These groups purposely ramped up expectations, overpromising, even knowing that the end result would under-deliver.
CFPB short-lister stirs controversy. American Banker's Ian McKendry: National Credit Union Administration Chairman J. Mark McWatters has not even been announced as President Trump's pick to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but his potential nomination already is uniting several diverse groups in opposition. Since news of McWatters' potential pick first broke in American Banker in December, banking industry representatives have criticized the idea of appointing him to the CFPB post over concerns that his past backing of the credit union industry poses a problem. As NCUA chairman, McWatters has publicly stated support for credit unions getting preferential regulatory treatment over banks, due to what he suggests is a safer business model.
I agree the first House bill was not the best solution, Cruz said, referring to the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the original AHCA would increase the number of uninsured by 24 million. In the Senate, we can improve it further. The best way to expand access is to drive down premiums.
He addressed concerns about drug costs that have increased even as Washington ramps up pressure on drug manufacturers. He said the Grassley-Wyden bill would actually have financial penalties for increasing the list price of your drugs. It could really turn around this constant dynamic of every January 1 and every July 1, the drug companies jack up the list prices of their drugs ... We can start breaking that dynamic if we get this bipartisan legislation passed through Congress.
Kamala Harris. She won the endorsement of Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who represents her birthplace of Oakland and is the first member of the House leadership team to weigh in. Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) was the first member of Congress to back Harris, but Lee is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to weigh in — a big deal, as Cory Booker is also aggressively courting the CBC.
Still, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. Welch said he holds out hope Trump would sign such a measure (assuming Democrats could somehow get it through the Senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.
In fact, it's bigger than the Iowa Democratic Party; it's an institutional breakdown that spans the nation, and both parties, as insurgent candidacies test the old machinery of our democracy.
They are going to come up with something really spectacular, Trump told reporters.
You saw what happened the last time they rigged the election! he added.
WALLACE: But, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your numbers don't add up. Please put up full screen number four. The Education Department, you talk about cutting, the total budget for the education department is $78 billion.
What's more, the American officials who are currently responsible for managing the U.S.-China relationship have other challenging issues on their plates. For example, the senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council is ostensibly the president's quarterback on China issues but also must coordinate policymaking on our relationships with allies across the Indo-Pacific region (including countries as varied as Indonesia, Australia and Japan) — not to mention the problem of what to do about the rogue regime in North Korea. Joe Biden's presidency will be defined in no small measure by what transpires in our relationship with China. He'd be wise to ensure he has a single person whom he can depend on and hold accountable for helping him navigate the difficult terrain ahead. Lanhee J. Chen is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the Hoover Institution and served as the policy director for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.
Moderate House Democrats trying to counter the Medicare-for-all push from liberals say they're focusing on ACA fixes as a pragmatic, bipartisan way forward. But so far they've not advanced any such measures that have GOP buy-in, even as they prepare for another ACA-themed hearing tomorrow morning in the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health subcommittee.
George Conway, who is married to White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, analyzed Gallup's map further:
We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
I am most concerned about the increasing appeal to employers to silence the criticism of citizens made in their private capacity as citizens, she wrote in an email to The Washington Post. Because most of us need our jobs, as few of us are financially independent, this is the most pernicious form of bullying of critics.
This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.
Democrats signaled Thursday that they may seek to extract a commitment from the Trump administration to fund the cost-sharing reduction payments as part of negotiations over a government spending bill. Current federal appropriations expire on April 28, and a partial government shutdown would follow if Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on how to extend funding.
In the deposition reported by Stat and ProPublica, Sackler chalks up his actions to just part of doing business. He claims he was motivated by an interest in making the best possible medications for patients in pain, Andrew writes. He also dismisses as simply misunderstood or innocuous any evidence that might be perceived as damaging. The sales tactics deployed by Purdue, which included rewarding top representatives with trips to Bermuda or London, were just what drug companies did, Sackler told a questioner.
-- Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was dropped by his speakers' bureau after he dismissively said womp womp on Fox in response to a story about a migrant girl with Down syndrome who was separated from her mother. (CNN)
Although Trump targeted conservative opponents of the bill Sunday, he has also shown signs of frustration with its moderate critics. On NBC's Meet the Press, Dent acknowledged that Trump told him in a private meeting that he was destroying the Republican Party and that he was going to take down tax reform, as first reported by the New York Times magazine.
We can hardly sustain our own Medicaid program as it currently exists, Cline said.

Bar Syrian refugees from entering the country and kick out any who are already living here, as they might be the ultimate Trojan horse. (Trump pulled back on kicking out Syrian refugees.)
Put plainly, this would be a huge risk, and it's a risk that the American people overwhelmingly oppose. It may well be the best available option for passing something, but that doesn't make it the best move, either politically or for the country's health-care system.
While McFarland learned the issue was Candida albicans, a fungus common in women's reproductive tracts, what she didn't know was the transplanted uterus had come from a donor suffering from a Candida infection in her bladder — a fact made clear by routine tests conducted by the Miami organ group that provided the uterus, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.
Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.
As the rules stand now, the rules I think say the special counsel will prepare a summary report on any prosecutive or declination decisions, and that shall be confidential and be treated as any other declination or prosecutive material within the department, Barr said.
Going the amendment route gives Northam more muscle, thanks to procedural arcana related to when Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) is allowed to break ties. Northam would need to win over two Republicans to pass a spending plan with expansion because Fairfax, who presides over the Senate, is not allowed to vote on the budget. But the lieutenant governor is permitted to vote on amendments, so if the governor proposes expansion as an amendment, he would need only one Republican senator to join Democrats to pass the plan.
The mother, Kristy Jackson, explained that her son had been learning about gun safety from his police-officer grandfather over the weekend and must have picked up the casing on the floor and brought it to school without her knowing. 'I was handed a piece of paper,' Jackson wrote. 'No words, just eyebrows raised in disgust at my son, explaining that his behavior warranted a 7 school day suspension.' (Note: According to Jackson, the officials at the school … had initially told her that her son had brought a bullet to school …) According to Fox 2, the school's vice principal later e-mailed Jackson to inform her that he was planning to contact the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in the wake of the incident.
But he stressed that it was up to Congress to pass a law to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity on par with other categories subject to civil rights protections.
Trump repeatedly bashes Romney on Twitter and tells Fox News's Sean Hannity that Romney choked. He criticizes the Affordable Care Act by calling it Romneycare/Obamacare.
The company's decision to change its name recalled other companies' efforts to revamp their reputations in the wake of scandal, such as the tobacco maker Philip Morris Co. changing its name to Altria, or ValuJet Airlines's switch to AirTran, Katie writes. Since taking over as chief executive, [Joseph Papa] has sought to rebuild the company's reputation, replacing much of its top management and vowing to limit annual price increases to less than 10 percent a year. It still had about $25 billion in debt as of the end of 2017.
Supporters of the initiative say the funding structure is sufficient to pay for expansion, and that unforeseen costs in the future could be dealt with through budget prioritization, Benjamin writes. But Republican state lawmakers have long opposed full expansion, citing the increased cost to the state. And despite the majority vote in favor of Prop 3, Sen. Allen Christensen, R-North Ogden, is preparing legislation to impose enrollment caps and work requirements on beneficiaries, and to delay implementation of the expansion until those changes can be approved by federal Medicaid administrators.
-- Which is it? Some senior administration officials argue Soleimani was killed as retaliation for increasing Iranian aggression, while others insist without evidence the aim was to avert an imminent threat. Karoun Demirjian, Karen DeYoung and Shane Harris report: At one end of the spectrum, national security adviser Robert O'Brien argued on 'Fox & Friends' that [Trump] authorized eliminating Soleimani because the Iranian general and his allies 'were looking to kill American diplomats and soldiers in significant numbers in the coming days.' But in comments before reporters at the State Department, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed to Iran's past behavior as justification, arguing that 'the days that led up to the strike' were what made the response urgent — and that the 'continuing efforts on behalf of this terrorist to build out a network of campaign activities that were going to lead potentially to the death of many more Americans' were an additional concern. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper split the difference, noting that there was 'exquisite intelligence' — a term of significance in spy circles — indicating that Soleimani was 'conducting preparing, planning military operations' akin to the 'terrorist activities' he had been pursuing against the United States for more than two decades.
They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.
Blocking expansion of the law also known as Obamacare had long been a rallying cry for the legislature's conservatives, but Chafin said it would provide desperately needed health care in his coal country district, among the poorest in the state.
Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.
TRUMP: I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.
KELLY: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is. But time and time again in this campaign, you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days. We've teed up just three examples in a videotape, similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate. The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake. Watch.
In a statement to The Post, Jillian Sackler said it's a gross injustice to blame my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the public health crisis surrounding opioids…Arthur was never involved in Purdue Pharma, a company owned by his brothers Mortimer and Raymond and their families; he had nothing to do with OxyContin.
How the stage was determined: Debate organizers used a randomized drawing to determine which candidates will appear in which debates. By chance, four of the top five candidates in the polls were placed into the same debate. NBC News opted to conduct that debate on the second night.
Among the reasons for this, Solomon says are problems with paperwork and red tape that lead to eligible people losing coverage. She also writes the requirements are ineffective in promoting employment because they don't accurately identify those who can work but aren't working … nor do they assess their needs or provide them with supports.
It's difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion-dollar companies, paying zero in taxes, Yang said, suggesting he would seek to close loopholes used by companies. (Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)
Some PBMs have been taking steps lately to remake their public image, which has taken a beating in the past year as they've been blasted by Azar and President Trump. OptumRx announced it will pass along rebate savings to all new employer-sponsored plans, starting in January. Express Scripts, recently acquired by Cigna, announced last week it will ensure that patients in commercial plans will pay no more than $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin.
Christopher describes some of the warnings from some makers of costly and advanced drugs, that unbranded versions could put you in the emergency room or could carry additional risks. The FDA approves the unbranded biologic copies by analyzing their structure and reviewing data from limited human tests. Drugs that make it through this process, according to the FDA, contain 'no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency,' he writes.
In an interview, Kaine said many Americans report high levels of satisfaction with the insurance they receive through their employers and that the goal of the Medicare X proposal is to provide another, lower cost option to people through the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, she writes.
The vice president has his meeting with the Ukrainian president and then a speech at the National Association of Manufacturers' summit. He will also meet with Republican lawmakers on the Hill before his dinner with the president.
3) Fight hard in the Senate with all available procedural weapons. Congressional scholar Sarah Binder has a good piece Friday that details all the procedural tools that Senate Democrats can use to focus attention on controversial parts of the president's agenda and force Republicans to cast potentially unpopular votes. They can also offer unrelated amendments to bills under debate, affording Democrats the chance to create discord among Republicans and between Republican senators and the White House.
Trump also thanked his critics ahead of the North Korea summit:
Again, this obviously comes up well shy of establishing a socialist United States government. That would require the means of production, distribution and exchange of goods to all be controlled by the state. This just isn't that. It's also important to note that these are goals, not concrete spending proposals with specific outlays over specific periods of time.
Perhaps some voters who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016 did not realize how bad he would be once in office, or they had bet on the Republicans restraining him. Maybe they deeply loathed Hillary Clinton. Now there is no excuse to keep him in power. And Bloomberg's bottomless wallet should pay for ads to blanket the airwaves reminding them just how dangerous he is.
Nonetheless, Democrats got hammered by Republican speakers for not attending the conference. Vice President Mike Pence matter-of-factly said that eight 2020 Democrats were boycotting, while Florida Sen. Rick Scott said that some Democrats were refusing to come to this conference. By the end of the conference, most of the eight Democrats who had been cited as boycotters had either met with AIPAC members from their states or, in the case of Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), addressed a closed session.
TRUMP: That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family.
There is something about the issue of immigration that makes people lose sight of where the American public is, said Pete Brodnitz, a Democratic pollster who worked on the House races in 2018 and has done extensive research on white voters who aren't college-educated. It becomes a really difficult issue if we choose to talk about it in terms that are not in the way the American people are talking about it.
That debate, on Capitol Hill and on the presidential trail, has split Democrats apart. Then came the new assault on Obamacare, a law she likened to a friend battered and bruised after a bar fight. It's someone everyone knew wasn't perfect but was ready to defend.
Barr promised the Justice Department would maintain its historic independence from politics, and said, President Trump has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any, other than that I would run the Department with professionalism and integrity.
Handel's victory may embolden Republicans in Washington to press ahead on an ambitious policy agenda that has yielded few legislative victories since Trump's inauguration in January, they write. Most immediately, the election result could bring momentum to Senate Republicans' efforts this week to craft their version of a major revision to the Affordable Care Act. More about Handel's position on health care from STAT News and from my colleague James Hohmann over at The Daily 202.
In his 1971 memorandum, Powell warned that business interests were under broad attack and urged them to be more aggressive. Today, however, most Americans believe that it's ordinary people who need protection against big corporations and plutocrats. The public may not fully grasp the role the court has played in exacerbating inequality. But Democratic presidential candidates may find a receptive audience if they explain that connection — and promise voters a court that puts ordinary Americans ahead of the 1 percent.
There's not anything you can do, he said. If they say no, it's no. It's the government.
Kennedy is one of six members of Trump's opioid commission, led by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), which issued a report with 56 recommendations for combating opioid addiction in the United States. But Kennedy told CNN the administration's response so far is tantamount to reshuffling chairs on the Titanic.
And President Trump has privately said he won't approve additional aid for Puerto Rico beyond food-stamp benefits. At a February meeting at the Oval Office, he asked top advisers for ways to limit federal support from going to Puerto Rico, believing it is taking money that should be going to the mainland, our colleagues write.
The issued has gained traction with Republicans recently, with other lawmakers introducing paid family leave proposals. The Health 202 wrote last month about a bill from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) that draws on existing retirement benefits.

OOF: Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International is changing its name to Bausch Health Companies, effective in July. Valeant, which has been at the receiving end of negative public scrutiny over high drug prices, is looking to reshape its brand by using the name of its more respected subsidiary, eye care company Bausch + Lomb, the New York Times's Katie Thomas reports.
The report also found that Jackson made sexual remarks about a female subordinate during a presidential trip to the Philippines in 2014. Out of 60 people interviewed about Jackson's impact on the medical unit's climate, only 13 had positive comments, according to the report.
They snark. They troll. They correct in real time. The mouthiest of them all typically start with the same word. As in . . .
In Missouri, where the state's gun laws were relaxed, Metzl made a startling discovery. I just started to look at the data and it turned out that as guns flooded into Missouri. … The real drivers of the dramatic rise in gun death in Missouri were white male suicides, Metzl told me. Get a load of this stunning statistic in his book. In 2015, Metzl writes, white men comprised roughly 40 percent of the population of Missouri but were victims of nearly 80 percent of gun suicides.
Of course, no one really expected him to meet those timelines. But this list seemed so specific — and official — that we decided it represented the ideal platform to measure Trump's promises, even though it was perhaps a bit light on foreign policy.
Completely replacing air travel with rail: Build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.
And then he has a photo shoot with The Washington Post. The president-elect will then travel to Washington D.C. from LaGuardia for a dinner honoring the chairman of the presidential inaugural committee, Mr. Tom Barrack. The president-elect will return to New York this evening.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., for the fourth time, administered the oath of office to the president-elect. But he has yet to see a supporter on the other side of the Bible.
According to Perry's email, which was first reported by the Washington Times, Mayorkas wants to reduce pressure on the border by getting ICE to help transport migrants northward so they can be processed and released.
He also appeared willing to meet Trump in the middle on some things, such as some kind of tax break for child care, a top Trump priority.
The Times also reports that Defense Secretary James Mattis was not consulted. But Bannon thought the executive order was necessary to shore up Trump's base, which was obviously more important than briefing top national security officials.
Maureen Corcoran, director of Ohio's Medicaid program, said her state was particularly concerned about being one of the few Medicaid expansion states where the uninsured rate among younger children was higher than among older kids.
[M]ost organ transplants go to to younger patients. According to the transplant society, 72.3 percent of liver transplant patients, 65.3 percent of heart transplant patients, and 59.7 percent of lung transplant patients are insured outside of Medicare at the time they receive new organs, Gina writes. Patients who were not on Medicare at the time of their transplants are required to get their anti-rejection drugs through Medicare's drug program, Part D, which is handled through commercial insurers.
Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who once supported preserving the filibuster, told who once supported preserving the filibuster, told the New York Times in January his opinion on the issue could change. I feel pretty damn strongly, but I will also tell you this: I am here to get things done,  Tester said.  If all that happens is filibuster after filibuster, roadblock after roadblock, then my opinion may change. 
Even that goal, however, is proving elusive. By late Monday, House leaders had collected more votes than ever but still appeared to be shy of the 216 Republicans they need to pass the measure. They're stuck between conservatives and moderates, both keenly aware of how they can be attacked on the issue next year.
I said Bob was a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such, Barr said he responded.
On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.
Meth use decreased after 2005 when Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Act, limiting sales to 7.5 grams for every 30 days. Some states required a prescription for pseudoephedrine, the nasal decongestant used to make it. And as a result, the use of prescription drugs and opiates spiked to fill the void. But the stimulant has returned, in part because as the ingredients became more difficult to acquire in the United States, Mexican drug cartels took over to fill the market with pure, low-cost meth, Frances reports.
Virginia Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax (D) spoke out against a rush to judgment on Feb. 24. Fairfax has been accused of sexual assault. (Virginia Senate)
— For the first time, a federal panel of health experts said it's urging doctors to identify women who may be at risk for perinatal depression because counseling can help prevent it.
By the numbers, the transition in the court's position on business-related issues has been dramatic. One study, from 2009, found that businesses won 28 percent of their cases before the court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren (over the period 1953 to 1969) but 64 percent under the current court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Another found that Justice Samuel Alito and Roberts are the No. 1 and No. 2 most pro-business justices, respectively, to serve since 1946.
The use of the word could does not get Harris off the hook. As currently drafted, the provision affects a relatively small portion of the health insurance market — and even then several factors would need to play out before a person faced an issue. Moreover, the Republican plan specifically sets aside billions of dollars to help states create high-risk or invisible health pools to assist people if their health condition results in higher premiums or loss of coverage during the one-year transition period. It's a valid question about whether the funding is adequate, but that's different than assuming there is no funding at all.
Yes, a certain amount of confusion might be forgiven for a novel effort. But the Trump administration's bungling of so many aspects of the pandemic tells us to be deeply wary. And the difficulties states face in handling the unprecedented number of applications for unemployment insurance need to be addressed now.
The change can be as simple as slapping a second mask over the one you already wear, or better yet, donning a fabric mask on top of a surgical mask. Some experts say it is time to buy the highest-quality KN95 or N95 masks that officials hoping to reserve supplies for health-care workers have long discouraged Americans from purchasing, Fenit Nirappil reports.
-- A Florida man who attempted to set a convenience store on fire told authorities that he mistook the Indian store owner as a Muslim, and that his crime was an attempt to run the Arabs out of our country. It's the latest in a string of distressing events in which South Asian people have been targeted and mistaken for people of Arab descent. (Amy B Wang)
-- The New Zealand shooting has led to heightened scrutiny of European far-right parties from which the alleged perpetrator gleaned inspiration. James McAuley reports: To many French Muslims, the Christchurch massacre was a tragic extension of normalized hatred that has also inspired anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attacks — some of them foiled — in France and elsewhere in Europe. ... Muslim advocates and journalists across the continent have pointed to the massacre to increase pressure on right-wing leaders and pundits, insisting that openly Islamophobic rhetoric carries with it the potential for deadly violence.
3. And, some of the Trump administration's proposed changes to Medicare are taken from Obama's own playbook. According to estimates by CFRB, 85 percent of the $575 billion in Medicare savings comes from reductions to provider payments — many of which mirror proposals from Obama, who in turnborrowed some of the ideas from President George W. Bush.
Little did those same people know, though, how lucky they would be in their efforts to cast the opposition as the ones rigging the outcome. As soon as it became apparent the Democratic caucuses would be mired in uncertainty, Trump allies leaped at the opportunity to declare Democrats were trying to rig the outcome.
Some of Trump's defenders say the president is right to continue pushing his agenda during the pandemic.
That community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where Federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. The Georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. The Federalist Society is one of our most active student organizations, law school Dean of Students Mitch Bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in March. Of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.
The proceedings showcased the paradoxes of Trump. His inaugural speech, delivered in a light rain, presented a scathing indictment of the very lawmakers and former presidents who sat behind him on the dais. The president charged the ­entrenched powers in both political parties with exploiting the forgotten men and women of our country.
But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you're angry about.
As a teenager, he had a part-time job at a local meatpacking plant, according to a biography posted on his campaign website. He and his sister were the first members of their family to attend college.
So, with that, let me get to any questions that you might have.
Trump told the story of 10-year-old Grace Eline, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and was a guest of First Lady Melania Trump. He said the budget request he'll present to Congress will request additional funding for childhood cancer research.
Meanwhile, positive tests for cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana have increased. In Nevada for example, where marijuana was legalized last year, positive tests rose 43 percent. Quest data suggested a continuing surge in methamphetamine use in the Midwest, South and parts of the Northeast, Lauren writes. Some states, including Nebraska and Idaho, saw sharp increases in cocaine positives.
I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.
Over the years, including early in his candidacy, Trump's position on abortion has fluctuated. But in July, he chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a fervent abortion opponent, as his running mate. Two months later, Trump dispatched a letter to pro-life leaders in which he pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices who oppose abortion rights, remove funding from Planned Parenthood and permanently institute the Hyde Amendment, a controversial provision that limits federal funding of abortion.
Some legal scholars are still debating the ramifications of the Senate disapproving of the emergency resolution, even without a veto-proof majority. (The non-delegation doctrine has been thrown around which prevents Congress from delegating legislative authority to the president). But for the most part, constitutional scholars like Yale professor of law and political science, Akhil Reed Amar, have deemed the vote to be judicially insignificant.
Sanders does not pussyfoot around and simply draws on the BLS data — which as we noted shows that nearly 8 million people hold more than one job.
In other words, the Trump administration is encouraging states to find ways to make Obamacare marketplace plans cheaper by allowing insurers to sell leaner, less expensive coverage.
Doctors wouldn't be required to participate in the new Medicare experiment. But Adam Boehler, director of the innovation center, predicted wide interest in the program, saying doctors could spend less time on billing Medicare and more time with patients. But Boehler said doctors could also boost their payments if they show good outcomes like better management of patients with high blood pressure or diabetes.
There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life, Trump said in a statement. Otto's fate deepens my Administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.
RUBIO: Notice that's not an answer.
-- The Constitution has changed over time in important ways, of course. Warren, for example, came out for ending the electoral college while speaking to a primarily black audience at a historically black university in Jackson, Miss. Black Americans were counted as three-fifths of a person until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.
How could it be that when we spend so much more than what other countries are spending, we have millions of people who may be dealing with the virus but they cannot go to the doctor because they can't afford it? Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Friday. What this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.
Bianca Mirales, 28, said she had driven two hours to meet Yang and was disappointed that she couldn't hear him in person. She had supported Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, she explained — I promoted Bernie a lot on social media — but did not hear a candidate who spoke directly to her until Yang.
OOF: The 24-year-old former Trump campaign worker who is leading the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy will step down by the end of the month because of controversy surrounding his appointment, The Post's Robert O'Harrow, Jr. reports. Taylor Weyeneth rose quickly to head the ONDCP, which is responsible for coordinating anti-drug initiatives at 16 federal agencies and supporting President Trump's efforts to confront the opioid epidemic. Mr. Weyeneth has decided to depart ONDCP at the end of the month, the White House said yesterday in a statement.
I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this.
HHS is also offering states more flexibility in running their marketplaces by expanding the use of waivers already available under the Affordable Care Act, Pate wrote. Known as 1332 waivers, these allow states to construct their own ways of delivering insurance to people, as long as they don't result in fewer people covered or cost the federal government more.
The unions for ICE agents and Border Patrol officers did endorse Trump in 2016 campaign. But they did not do so unanimously. Hillary Clinton received 5 percent of the vote of the ICE membership, according to a statement by the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council. The National Border Patrol Council endorsement, meanwhile, was based just on the vote of 11 union leaders, which sparked controversy among union members. Agents in El Paso, in a 14-13 vote, narrowly failed to have the local union disavow the endorsement.
The State Department's remarks came hours after Sen. Ben Sasse released a statement questioning why U.S. leaders were not commenting on the matter: Americans expect our leaders to call out thugs who trample the basic human rights of speech, press, assembly, and protest, the Nebraska Republican said.
Bloomberg, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $55 billion, did not release his tax returns while he was mayor in the traditional sense of the word. He allowed reporters to view redacted versions in which numbers were replaced by letter categories going from A to G, which covered $500,000 or more. The last release, in 2013, showed Bloomberg paid taxes of at least $1.5 million at the federal, state and local levels and at least $1.5 million to foreign governments.
A Border Patrol officer described what it was like to separate migrant children from their parents in a Frontline documentary:
Experts warn the administration could struggle to reach two vulnerable groups likely to be among those who need help the most: households where incomes are so low families don't file federal income taxes and families experiencing changes in their living arrangements.
TRUMP: ... No, I'm not playing.
If approved, the dramatic policy change would recast government-subsidized health coverage as temporary assistance by placing a limit on the number of months adults have access to Medicaid benefits, Tony writes. At least five states — Arizona, Kansas, Utah, Maine and Wisconsin — are seeking waivers from the Trump administration to impose lifetime Medicaid coverage limits. The Department of Health and Human Services said it could not comment on the pending applications.
-- Trump once again called for the elimination of federal arts agencies. Previous proposals by the president along these lines have been soundly rejected by Congress, which has instead increased funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. (Peggy McGlone)
Schumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative Democrats such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.
From the president of the Council on Foreign Relations:
The recommendations the group sent to its 3,400 members have fueled a debate on how genetic testing should be used in disease prevention and treatment.
We already know that the tax plans offered by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would deliver large windfalls to top earners. Meanwhile, Ryan recently suggested in an interview with John Harwood that any tax reform the GOP embraces would likely cut top rates. Ryan has taken himself out of the running for president, but he functions as a useful generic unicorn savior candidate for now, a placeholder of sorts.
The practice of district judges issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump's policies began with the president's travel ban — which was blocked by lower courts but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court after multiple modifications. Barr stressed that when the president makes emergency decisions, he's politically accountable for that — and yet a judge with a lifetime appointment sitting somewhere in the country … can stop a national security measure, globally essentially.
Sanders briefly tried to inject himself into a debate over generational change, yelling, Who has the guts to take on Wall Street!
Kasich had harsh words for both Democrats and Republicans, excoriating them for being too consumed with politics to be anything but shortsighted and disingenuous when it comes to fixing the health-care system, and complaining that sometimes my party asks too much.
I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt, Barr said.
OOF: A grand jury is deliberating in the criminal investigation of at least 11 deaths being linked to improper insulin injections at a West Virginia Veterans Affairs hospital, our Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Matt Zapotosky report.
-- Mark Corallo, the spokesman for Trump's personal legal team, was highly critical of the president on Twitter before his hiring – disparaging some of his policy initiatives and, on one occasion, circulating an opinion piece saying Trump had eroded the credibility of the office he holds. The New York Times' Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman report: In April … [Corallo] used Twitter to suggest — twice — that [Pence], not Mr. Trump, should be the Republican nominee for president in 2020. In May, he posted several remarks disparaging the influence of [Ivanka Trump] and Jared Kushner … [and] later last month, Mr. Corallo lavishly praised Robert Mueller … His posts are a rare instance of a Trump ally publicly venting criticism of a president who prizes loyalty and is known to be averse to dissent. 'Hey Mr. President, where's all the 'winning?' Mr. Corallo wrote last month, appearing to compare Mr. Trump to Bill Clinton, who hailed from Arkansas, and his famous parsing of words. 'Or, like the guy from AR, are you going to tell me it depends on the definition of 'winning?' ... It would be simple to dismiss his comments on Twitter as the personal social media musings of a private citizen. But Mr. Trump, who makes little distinction between his own personal and official utterances, often bristles at mild slights, even in an informal setting.
This legislation, hammered out by Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and ranking Democrat Jon Tester (Mont.), tries to appease conservatives who want to ease restrictions on private care while reassuring liberals that private care won't replace 1,700 VA hospitals and clinics across the country.
The executives also stressed that their companies have taken steps to prevent the diversion of drugs and to help fight the opioid crisis, when pressed by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone (N.J.) to explain how things are different now.
Everybody has a podcast, she'd grumble when the subject would come up in the past. And I get it, says director Adam McKay (The Big Short, Anchorman), a longtime friend and one of those nudging her. You want to do a TV show. It certainly seems bigger and cooler, but that's changing. I honestly don't know anyone out there right now with the reach that Joe Rogan has.
-- Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace proposal was quickly criticized for granting Israel most of what it has sought over decades of conflict while establishing a disjointed Palestinian state. Anne Gearan, Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: Trump touted the plan as the potential solution to decades of bloody strife, but his administration did little to solicit the support of Palestinian leaders who had rejected it sight unseen and played no role in its drafting. The president presented the proposal as the best Palestinians could hope to get during a ceremony where he stood beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who eagerly embraced both the president and what he presented. … The plan would grant Israel vast license to incorporate Jewish settlements and maintain a yoke of security on land it now occupies — proposals that could have immediate consequences. Netanyahu plans to move forward with annexing the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley as soon as this weekend… The detailed proposal offers a four-year window for Palestinians to begin negotiations for what would amount to a smaller, weaker version of statehood than envisioned by past U.S. presidents. But the conditional sovereignty is still more than Palestinians have now, and more than many of Trump's critics thought he would offer.
— Who wants to keep trying to repeal the ACA? Big shocker: It's Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who yesterday told the Washington Examiner that Republicans needed to finish the job on repealing and replacing the health-care law in 2018. He said he's pushing his colleagues to use another budget reconciliation bill this year to accomplish their longstanding campaign promise before the midterm elections in November.
The bill would require women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound, at which time a physician would detect whether there is a heartbeat, Kristine writes. The bill also would prohibit someone from acquiring, providing, receiving, transferring or using a fetal body part in Iowa. A violator could be charged with a Class C felony.
And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.
During a meeting last week with insurance executives, Trump used his televised remarks to talk about his efforts to help the cruise industry and airline industry. He spoke only briefly about health care.
--We've already discussed how Democrats will intensify their attacks this week against Republicans for refusing to hold committee hearings on their health-care bill or otherwise invite any bipartisan participation. Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler contrasts exactly what McConnell is saying about the process now with his criticisms of Democrats as they were passing the ACA back in 2010.
I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know, Trump said, referring to McCain's vote against overhauling the Affordable Care Act in July 2017. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote, and he said thumbs down.
But that may be changing. Even as Trump addressed senators, the insurer Centene, which already covered 1.2 million people on the exchanges, announced that it would expand its offerings in Obamacare, pushing into Nevada, Missouri and Kansas for the first time and adding presence in six other states, including Ohio. The company said that while there is uncertainty of new health-care legislation, it also saw opportunity where other companies had left the market.
BAIER: Governor Kasich, today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention. Today also Mitt Romney proposed that Republicans should vote for Senator Rubio in Florida. They should vote for you in Ohio. They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination.
Expand use of Health Savings Accounts, which allow workers to save money for medical expenses without having to pay federal income tax on those funds. These payments will be allowed to accumulate and can be passed on to heirs. These funds can be used by any member of a family. (HSAs are very similar to when Trump took office.)
According to internal communication reported in this revealing story from ProPublica's David Armstrong, co-published with Stat, company leaders discussed the naturally linked nature of opioid sales and the sale of addiction treatment, suggesting Purdue Pharma should expand to the pain and addiction spectrum.
What's more, Trump's idea would cover only covid-19 treatment — it wouldn't offer the complete health coverage that all of those people need. Why raid the fund when the insurance markets and Medicaid stand ready to offer complete coverage? To be sure, there are some, including many immigrants, who won't find coverage elsewhere. The hospital fund is an important backstop but it is indefensible as the first-line policy response.
Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow on Jan. 28 said senators cannot impeachment a president based on an unsourced allegation reportedly in John Bolton's new book. (U.S. Senate)
Why are Republicans still trying to undo the ACA? We argue in a forthcoming article that the law's political vulnerabilities and Republican electoral dynamics drive conservative efforts to uproot it.
The first lady tweeted this yesterday:
The polling numbers suggest differences in policy emphasis based on which side of the party's strategic divide a candidate rests. Some, such as Ryan and Joe Biden, who is expected to join the race soon, see winning in the Midwest as central to victory in the electoral college and place a higher priority on the concerns of white working-class voters there.
The London patient, infected with HIV and suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma, received bone marrow cells from a donor who had a malfunctioning CCR5 gene as part of his cancer treatment, Carolyn writes. The gene is known to create a protein that is crucial for HIV to invade blood cells. Brown had also received a transplant without functioning CCR5 genes.
But the party suffered many losses, and the battle lasted many days. Finally, the climax:
Lamb blunted the impact of those attacks, most notably by saying in early January that he would not support Pelosi for speaker. His highest-profile surrogate, former vice president Joe Biden, has enjoyed high approval ratings from all voters since passing on a 2016 presidential bid.
Serrano, who arrived in the House after a 1990 special election, said in a Monday statement that he is living with Parkinson's disease and planned to serve out the rest of his term. He said nothing about the race to replace him, but speculation focused immediately on state Sen. José M. Serrano, the congressman's son, who didn't rule out a run.
But white evangelicals, who made up 26 percent of the electorate in the last election cycle, have been a powerful group to court politically since the 1980s. Exit polls showed that 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump, and the president's approval rating among those voters remains strong at 78 percent, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.
Trump said he would use his remarks to bypass the dishonest media and speak directly to the American people about the incredible progress his administration has made.
And then secondly, last night's meetings were I assume in part about Obamacare, but also about the tax path forward and if there was any concern about the tax package going in the second reconciliation and whether that would actually happen this year or would be pushed back to get Obamacare dealt with before the tax legislation is.
Romney's plan would be paid for, in part, by eliminating a welfare program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which could spark opposition among Democrats. But the plan has also gained praise from some unlikely quarters, with some on the left saying that it would be easier to navigate than existing programs.
Though the president began on a subdued, almost melancholy note, looking down repeatedly to read from prepared remarks on his lectern, he became more fiery and animated — joyful, even — when he began to banter and joust with the assembled reporters. At times, he seemed to reprise some of his favorite themes from the campaign trail, complaining about Clinton and criticizing President Barack Obama's policies, from his Affordable Care Act to his failed reset with Russia.
The White House on Friday defended its rollout, saying of the 80 million payments made this week, all but 1 percent reached their intended recipients. Trump on Friday called the initiative an incredible success.
But now The Post has some important new reporting that suggests a split has opened up among top Trump advisers around this very topic. Some of them appear to be balking at such a course of action — and it's telling that one of them is Stephen K. Bannon, because he is the keeper of the eternal flame of Trump populism.
Yesterday, the president-elect announced that Jared Kushner would be serving as a senior adviser to the president. He is going to work closely with Chief-of-Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon to execute the president-elect's agenda.
I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off. Trump said he will make time for golf but promised to always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us. (Trump played golf more often than Obama, whom he often regularly criticized for playing too much, and he rarely did so with people of such stature. He also spent lots of time at his properties away from the White House.)
The agency has made some tweaks to next year's open enrollment season, halving its duration and requiring more eligibility verification for those trying to sign up after the normal window closes, Randy Pate, deputy director of HHS' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted in his response back to Kriedler.
The lack of adequate testing kits, a problem acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflects the flawed response by the Trump administration, said Ben Sommers, a doctor who teaches at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Trump's attempts to weaken the ACA will make it harder for people to access the tests once they become widely available, he said.

TRUMP: The next day. But I had learned. I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question. This was brand new. But -- and I really mean it. You have to show a degree of flexibility. If you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change?
That's the way it has been for two centuries of our nation's history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.
Now that Trump's presidency has come to an end, I decided to look back at Johnson's list to see where Trump's promises landed. Many of them are tough to pin down because of a lack of specificity, but most are easier to evaluate. And the number of broken promises far outnumbers the 31 by our count that he kept.
The federal government would bring in $51.7 billion in sales tax in the same time frame.
Why in the world would we want Europe to be dependent on Russian energy, when they could have more energy coming from the United States?
5. Propping up subsidies for Obamacare: This is top priority for one Republican in particular, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine). She got an agreement from Senate Republican leaders that she would vote for the tax bill IF they voted on a bipartisan bill to continue payments that help lower-income people with health-care costs.
For too long the rules have been written in favor of people who have the most, and not the ones who work the most, Harris said.
Some of those people would willingly lose their insurance, the CBO said, because they would no longer be required by law to have health insurance. (A mandate to have health insurance or else pay taxes is the linchpin of Obamacare.) Others, though, would unwillingly lose their insurance because they wouldn't be able to afford it.
-- Saudi authorities are warning of a powerful and destructive cyberattack launched on Dec. 29 that experts have tied to Iran. From Yahoo News: Officials in Riyadh, who nicknamed the malware 'Dustman,' did not directly attribute the malicious attack to Iran, according to a Saudi technical report. … However, according to experts who reviewed the technical report and analyzed possible motivation and similarities to past attacks, Tehran is the most likely culprit. The 'wiper' attack, which was identified by the Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority, used malware to erase digital data belonging to unidentified targets in the Middle East.
Require that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. There are various ways one could try to count whether this promise has been achieved, not all of which would support the administration, but there is little doubt that the president has attacked regulations. To achieve this ratio, the administration does not tally only economically significant items but includes minor deregulatory actions, such as allowing the importation of fresh pomelo fruit from Thailand and deregulation of the pine shoot beetle.
He added one: unpresidential. He's not what you would expect a leader of this country to be.
Although immigration agents swiftly deport single adults from the border, the latest DHS statistics show that families and children who are allowed into the United States are virtually guaranteed to stay at least a few years.
* WHAT STEVE BANNON REALLY MEANS: Stephen Bannon has been vowing the deconstruction of the administrative state. E.J. Dionne has an apt description of what this really means:
OOF: Updated CDC guidances urges people to wear two masks or ensure a tighter fit to protect against the coronavirus.
­-- Mexicans seeking refuge in the United States to escape violence in their homeland fear even worse dangers if they are sent to Guatemala under a new Trump administration plan to crack down on asylum seekers. From Reuters: It was unclear when the United States would begin sending Mexicans to Guatemala. The Mexican government estimated that 900 Mexican asylum seekers could be affected from February, without giving a timeframe or explaining how it reached that number. Mexicans who say their homes are unsafe due to drug gang extortion said the policy leaves them few options. 'I can't go home, they've already kidnapped my brother and son,' said Carlos, a Mexican seeking to reach the United States via the border city of Tijuana. He said he had fled criminal gangs in the southwestern state of Guerrero. 'They're after me. If I go back they're sure to kill me. If I'm not safe in Mexico, I'll be even less safe in Guatemala,' he said, requesting his last name be withheld for security reasons. … Sitting in a chilly camp in Ciudad Juarez, one woman from the state of Zacatecas, who declined to give her name, said she was trying to reach the United States because she had family there, and would be safe.
But many more establishment Republicans, who backed the GOP health care bills despite political warning signs, lost their seats. One donor on the call, bringing up the health-care issue and the GOP's profound midterm reversal in states Trump won, urged McCarthy to get off that horse — it ain't gonna happen, adding, If Obamacare's that bad, it's going to fail on its own.
(5) Virginia will be the 33rd state (along with the District of Columbia) to approve Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion appears here to stay, and despite the best efforts of the GOP House and right-wing pundits, has widespread, bipartisan support in every geographic region, with the exception of the Southeast (which includes some of the poorest states) and the Great Plains (although Nebraska and Idaho could join Virginia). In a nutshell, Medicaid is the absolute star of the Trump presidency despite every effort on their part, said Andy Slavitt, the former head of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who served during the Obama administration. By the end of his term, you could see five more states expand. And there is a tipping point for the hold out states at that point. The irony of course is that this is a far more Democratic idea than exchanges, a Republican idea [originating at the Heritage Foundation].
Don't expect a swift reversal of Trump's America First policy. Biden pledged on his campaign website, There is no going back to business as usual on trade.
For income tiers in between, the subsidies at each tier would be larger than they are now.
Get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship. Trump would also look into lifting the sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea. (Trump got along great with Putin — often to the consternation of U.S. officials. But he did not lift Crimea-related sanctions.)
Sen. Time Kaine (D-Va.) celebrated state Sen. Jennifer Wexton's primary win and said Virginia will help take the House back, take the Senate back:

*President Obama: Clinton went out of her way, repeatedly, to praise what the current president has done in office — from Obamacare to Iran and back. Sanders sought to play down his differences with Obama by noting that he and I are friends. Had O'Malley had time to talk, I am certain he would have praised Obama, too.
But even the most fervent advocates for expansion say there is a long way to go, with Wednesday merely marking the start of what could be weeks of negotiations.
If anything, since the diagnosis, Trump and his allies have ramped up their criticism of McCain. The most outrageous instance of that was in May, when a White House aide went so far as to make light of the senator's health behind closed doors. The White House refused to publicly apologize when those comments leaked.
Under the settlement, Purdue will spend $102.5 million to help establish a new addiction center at the Oklahoma State University. Sackler family members, who were not defendants in the case, will pay $75 million in personal funds over five years. Purdue will also pay $20 million to provide additional treatment drugs and $12 million to cities and towns and cover about $60 million in litigation costs.
Her faith comforts her in what she sees as a perilous moment for the country. Hollis said she was just so tickled when heavy winds blew down a section of Trump's border wall a few weeks ago before the cement hardened. To her, it was a sign. God is good, Hollis said. To me, that was a warning. Those little things, those are warnings. You can't fight against the powers that be. That wall is going to come down one way or another. Just ask Joshua.
Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee: This decision rewards Republicans in their never-ending crusade to rip away pre-existing condition protections from families while leaving Americans with massive uncertainty about the future of their health care.
He said after starting with such a Medicare buy-in option, over time, people will see how well this works.

The House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the Trump administration's family separation policy on Tuesday.
She supported Clinton because she wanted her to be the first female president and because Bill Clinton was one of my favorite presidents, so she was confident that Hillary Clinton would have carried on similar policies.
— The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation held a hearing Wednesday regarding the outbreak and response, asking experts to weigh in. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security, argued the travel restrictions the U.S. government has implemented would do little to stop the spread of the virus given its speed.
The Trump administration dropped their budget for next year on May 23. Here are three of the biggest cuts it proposes. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
McElvain's departure highlights internal frustration generated by the decision. The Justice Department's decision last week reversed years of legal work McElvain and the Justice Department had performed on the issue, Devlin and Matt write. McElvain and his team were honored in 2013 with the Attorney General's Award for exceptional service defending the legislation in court. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed his resignation takes effect in early July. McElvain declined to comment.
This case involves two sections of the Affordable Care Act: 1401 and 1402. Section 1401 provides tax credits to make insurance premiums more affordable, while Section 1402 reduces deductibles, co-pays, and other means of cost sharing by insurers. Section 1401 was funded by adding it to a preexisting list of permanently-appropriated tax credits and refunds. Section 1402 was not added to that list. The question is whether Section 1402 can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation. It cannot.
Parents who have to stay home to care for their children amid widespread school closures would be eligible for up to 12 weeks of paid family leave.
Over the past four years, the Trump administration loosened rules for HealthCare.gov and the state-run individual marketplaces, cracking open the door to coverage that might cost less but also place more limits on benefits.
In a volatile TV news landscape where the longtime ratings leader, Fox News, is suffering through a period of internal turmoil, One America has tried to elbow itself into the big leagues, publicly wooing former Fox star Bill O'Reilly to join OAN. Although O'Reilly didn't take the bait and the channel is available in only about 30 million homes, a far cry from Fox News's 90 million, One America is growing — in viewer numbers, in influence in Republican circles, and as a potential alternative for conservatives and libertarians who believe Fox's commitment to a right-wing perspective is weakening.
During his campaign for the GOP nomination, Trump said that McCain, who spent more than five years as a POW in Vietnam, was not a war hero, and continued to snub the longtime senator throughout McCain's battle with brain cancer.
But I -- we'll try to get further updates as we move closer to those days.
Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the Mexican border.
-- Trump's recent criticisms of Fox News could mark a turning point in his relationship with the network, which has generally showered him with praise. Sarah Ellison and Paul Farhi report: The spat comes as Fox's parent company is undergoing a generational change — one that produced another, perhaps more subtle sign of independence from the president. On Tuesday, Fox Corp. began public trading as the new parent of Fox News, Fox Entertainment and Fox Sports; the company is the result of 21st Century Fox's sale of its film and television assets to Disney Corp. The new company is headed by Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert Murdoch, who co-founded Fox News with Roger Ailes and remains a controlling shareholder in Fox.
Progressive outside groups may come to regret not organizing more in opposition to Gorsuch. Betsy DeVos will have only a very small fraction of the impact that Gorsuch will on the trajectory of this country, yet the liberal grass roots mobilized against her nomination to be secretary of education by what felt like a factor of 10. There were literally empty seats at the back of the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing room last week.
He always said his proudest vote was for the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and Dingell introduced the bill that created the Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department.
Koppel didn't miss a beat: Yeah, he said, continuing despite multiple interruptions from Hannity. He added: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts.
TRUMP: ... Before they had the information it got -- it is right now an A, once they had the information...
Oh God. Horrible horrible horrible horrible, she said. He embarrasses me really. I try not to watch the news anymore. It's so embarrassing the way he behaves.

I think it is important that we have people in politics on the liberal side, on the progressive side, that represent faith, that take back the meaning behind faith, that it is not a conservative ideal, says Alex Moreschi, a White Episcopal minister. At its heart, Christianity is a progressive movement. It is a radical movement for the health and security and love of neighbor. And I see Rev. Warnock representing that.
The missive comes as business leaders are navigating a potentially tricky path in the wake of enactment of the GOP tax package. Republicans are eager to see them hand out bonuses, wage gains and other new benefits to workers as evidence that the deep cut to the corporate tax rate is proving its value to average Americans.
It's been one year since Trump promised prescription drugs would become less expensive. Last night, he tried to take a victory lap even though the policies his administration has proposed on the issue could take months or years to make a difference.
On average, immigration courts see several thousand cases per day. During the shutdown, they have been canceled. No future date has yet been set; many cases will need to be bumped to the end of the line.
The proposal should also serve as a warning to Democratic presidential candidates that following Sanders down the rabbit hole marked Medicare-for-all is foolish politically and unresponsive to voters' demands. They should feel comfortable either endorsing the House plan or coming up with their own add-ons to Obamacare. At a time Republicans still are trying to repeal Obamacare, these steps are hardly insignificant.
At the hearing, Washington state Health Secretary John Wiesman urged state lawmakers to pass the bill and debunked claims from some in attendance that vaccines are dangerous.
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told reporters that the pandemic has laid bare the need for more public health investment and that the United States must rebuild stronger and fairer in the wake of this crisis. The bill is co-sponsored by 19 Senate Democrats, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Republicans have warned in apocalyptic terms that the resolution could take away people's cars and even lead to killing cows. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is moving to hold a show vote to force Democrats to take a position on the resolution. Inslee said Republicans are using scare tactics that remind him of the debate over Obamacare.
The Hill, Faces & Voices of Recovery and Indivior hold an event on the opioid crisis and supporting recovery.
And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.
I'm much bigger than this man and have a much, much bigger net worth. I mean my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney, Trump adds.
TRUMP: I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.
I think we know enough now to know that Donald Trump is doing the same kinds of things that Jeb Bush would have done or Marco Rubio would have done or Mitt Romney would have done, he said.
Im still a no, said Sen. Charles W. Bill Carrico (R-Grayson), who had been targeted by some expansion advocates because they argued it would help his rural district. I don't have any faith that it will be there, he said of federal funding.
Did McConnell flip-flop? Yes, for which Glenn awards him an upside-down Pinocchio.
Senators including Mike Lee (R-Utah) believe these changes will help reduce health-care spending, prevent tax-credit dollars from paying for abortions and expand access to health insurance by lowering premiums — all arguments supported by conservative advocacy groups.
She called the policy proposals to shore up the country's health-care plans superficial fixes and railed against the current system as a sickness system rather than a health-care system.
As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.
In some places, including the District and Maryland, vaccine appointments are being snapped up by residents of majority-White areas, who often have more access to the Internet, transportation to vaccine clinics and flexibility about taking off work, Lola and Dan write.
Rubio's measure, which he first introduced in August, would allow new parents to finance at least two months of paid leave by drawing from their Social Security benefits, which would result in a three- to six-month delay in receiving those benefits when they retire. While the measure wouldn't cost anything because it draws on existing benefits, it hasn't yet received any co-sponsors.
On the ground, unions ran an aggressive turnout operation, winning back many members who had backed Trump for president. Lamb's campaign focused on preserving Medicare and Social Security, and warning that Republican policies would put them at risk. The United Mine Workers of America, which had sat out the 2016 election, endorsed Lamb when the Democrat promised to support legislation that would fully fund their pensions.
(The Health 202 maintains our official position that all this could be resolved if the two senators would just chill out together over a bottle of whiskey from Scottish whiskey bottler Alexander Murray & Company.)
Tariffs come up for the first time in two nights: International trade, which did not emerge as a focal point in Wednesday's debate, came up tonight. Trump's trade war with China has been a consistent target for many Democratic candidates.

And there is the matter of biography. Mr. Biden comes to the presidency not as an overconfident outsider but as someone who learned the meaning of stewardship over a complex body politic through decades in the Senate and eight years in the vice presidency. He has made his share of mistakes, but never that of suggesting that he alone could fix this country's problems. Rather, he has a record of bipartisan cooperation, and he has defended it even against rivals for the Democratic nomination. He converted one such critic, Vice President Harris, into a historic partner — the first woman and first Black person to hold the nation's second-highest office.
Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obama's law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge lawmakers on, Trump plans to attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia this month.
-- Democratic candidates, desperate to break through, continue to play footsie with extreme ideas that would make it harder to defeat Trump. The latest is retro: packing the Supreme Court. FDR is rolling his eyes somewhere. Michael Scherer reports: At an event last week in Philadelphia, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., said he was open to discussing a plan pushed by some liberal groups for the next Democratic president to appoint four new justices to the Supreme Court, bringing the total to 13. 'We need to set that as the level of intellectual and policy ambition that we have, which does not come naturally to our party lately,' Buttigieg said. 'So I haven't reached a considered opinion on that one yet, but I do think very bold, very ambitious ideas deserve a hearing right now.' Scherer likens this kind of boldness to when Alan Cranston embraced the nuclear freeze movement as a candidate in 1984.
In introducing legislation, Mr. Hanna at times sought consensus even when it seemed unlikely.
This is worse than a gimmick, he said. It does game the scoring process, and it disguises the damaging effects of the bill.
Kohler blamed the Trump administration's attacks on Obamacare, such as spending less money to help educate consumers and enroll them in health insurance, for a decline in coverage among both children and adults.

Several PBMs have also been purchased in recent years by health insurers, raising questions about whether they can play an independent role in negotiating between the two parties. And, their negotiations are secretive and opaque, making it nearly impossible for consumers to find out whether they're sharing in the rebate savings.
— Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will return to the jobs today after the president signed a bill to reopen the government for three weeks. It may take weeks or months for operations to return to normal after the 35-day partial shutdown, our Post colleagues Juliet Eilperin, Lisa Rein and Sarah Kaplan report.
TRUMP: ... if we went out to the proper bid. Of course you are.
On one level, it is true that Democrats cannot react to everything Trump says. But she made Trump the alpha dog in that fight by conducting the DNA test and releasing the video. She put him in control. Moreover, the notion that Warren is just going to let Trump's barbs slide off of her raises the question: Does she really know how to fight back? Could Trump put her back on her heels from day one of the general election?
When his 8-year-old daughter had an ear infection last week, the family paid cash — $90 for the appointment and $50 for the medications.
This is news, declared Pelosi (D-Calif.). I haven't said this to any press person before. But since you asked, and I've been thinking about this, impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country. And he's just not worth it.
But the state Senate, which like the House is under narrow GOP control, did not agree to a budget with expansion, concerned that Washington would not make good on its funding and stick the state with the cost.

We can't be chasing the perfect all the time, Priebus said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. I mean, sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win.
When a campaign appears to be on a downward spiral, it becomes easy to see signs of doom. … There was Biden's anemic cheering section at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner — a raucous fundraiser held in a Manchester hockey arena — that appeared smaller even than the group that came out to support nominal presidential candidate Deval Patrick. There's the ways in which Biden has begun acting like an underdog, attacking his opponents as too inexperienced … or too extreme … Even his supporters have begun talking about him like a long shot. 'No one ever expected Donald Trump to be elected president, either,' said Barry Nestor, standing outside the Rex Theatre in Manchester, wearing socks on his hands to keep warm before seeing Biden speak.
TRUMP: First of all I've had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are -- 98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country. I'm very proud of it. You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club, it's a very, very successful club. It has a very short season, it's called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.

Referring to the drone strike that killed Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, which prompted Iran's retaliation, Bloomberg added: Nobody should feel sorry for the guy that was killed. He was a bad guy who killed a lot of Americans. Two presidents before President Trump looked at the opportunity to kill the guy and decided not to. … We don't know what the intelligence is or was, and that will come out eventually. … The problem, to me, is that we have a president who tends to make decisions irrationally and impulsively and recklessly. I don't know that he isn't doing that this time.
Just weeks before President Biden took office, the Trump administration urged states in a Jan. 4 letter to sign agreements that would preserve work requirements in the program for nine months before they could be undone by the federal government, the Wall Street Journal's Stephanie Armour reports.
Those without college degrees were more likely to say the shift would weaken the country, and there were also clear regional differences: 37 percent of whites in Western states said the change would weaken customs and values, compared with 47 percent of whites in Midwestern states.
Ryan initially rebuffed Trump when the New Yorker was poised to grab the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. But with Trump in the White House, the two men forged a relationship that was friendly, if occasionally uneasy, and Ryan did little to check the president or encourage oversight of his administration.
Just before returning to Washington from his summer break, Reid sat down with the Reno Gazette-Journal, saying it was crazy of Patricia Smith, whose son was killed in Benghazi, to blame Hillary Clinton. He also described Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican candidate to succeed him in the Senate, as the most fraudulent person he's known in 50 years of politics.
As for Abrams, she told New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister of when she'll make a decision to jump in the race: I'll know when I know.
The most dramatic change, newly central in the coronavirus pandemic, is on health care. By popularizing Medicare-for-all, he has shifted the entire conversation. Now, the moderate position in his party is universal coverage with a public option, an approach that was out of the Democrats' reach when they passed Obamacare a decade ago.
One is that this vote wasn't strictly about whether to raise the minimum wage; it was whether the $15 hike belonged in the coronavirus relief package. Sinema has in the past supported a higher minimum wage, and her critics, including Tlaib's fellow House Democrat Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, highlighted that Friday night. Wow, Pocan wrote, while sharing a 2014 Sinema tweet that said raising the minimum wage was a no-brainer.
Things were good until the health-care debacle stepped in and made them bad, Riffle said.
I find the whole thing really interesting, Yang said, as a campaign aide looked on nervously. Yang asked if he should share the joke that he wanted to tweet when the story became viral — something that tied his warnings about job automation to his opinions about circumcision. The aide urged him not to, so Yang went ahead and did it anyway.
Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice - -
Except, that will almost certainly backfire on him, warn current and former Senate aides and congressional procedural experts. Here's why:
The campaign began privately deliberating whether to formally request Secret Service protection for the candidate after protesters rushed the stage at his Tuesday night event in Los Angeles in what experts called a major security breach. Both Biden and [Sanders] rely on private security firms to handle their public appearances, which is unusual this late in a presidential campaign cycle in comparison with 2016, 2012 and 2008, David Nakamura and Carol Leonnig report. Campaigns must request protection from the DHS, and a bipartisan congressional advisory committee — led by the Senate majority leader, currently Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — helps review the request before the DHS secretary makes a decision. Outsourcing security to the federal government can be a boon for cash-strapped campaigns and also bestow a heightened legitimacy on candidates. But some candidates in past presidential campaign cycles have tried to hold off over concerns that a large security entourage could hamper their ability to interact more directly with supporters. Sanders had protection for several months during the 2016 primaries, but his campaign did not immediately respond to questions on the subject.
When evaluating various telehealth bills, the Congressional Budget Office has generally taken the position that virtual health care would cost Medicare more, because it could drive greater use of services and can involve two separate payments — one to the provider and one to the facility where the patient is located.

At the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.

His attack — starting with a tweet that singled out the House Freedom Caucus as well as the influential Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America — marked a new turn in the increasingly troubled relationship between the White House and a divided GOP still adjusting to its unorthodox standard-bearer.
Pence will join Trump for the healthcare listening session, his Cabinet meeting and lunch with Chao. He'll also join the president as he signs his executive order later in the afternoon.
At least in structure, these agriculture plans seem eerily similar to two dozen cooperative plans created under the ACA that almost all collapsed over the past few years under heavy financial losses. The dramatic and undeniable failure of the co-op plans — which had been added to the ACA to spur competition in the marketplaces — were, for a while at least, a top GOP critique of the health-care law.
I really don't appreciate how he talks, but I like what he's doing now to help us out, the 18-year-old high school senior said of Trump.

10 a.m.: Feinstein says she is concerned about Barr's views on presidential power
Sean, I just wanted to know what the president-elect's opinion is or what he thinks about Tom Price's proposal for Obamacare replacement? What -- what does he view that as? Does he view that as a starting place for Obamacare replacement? And how does he view some of those -- all of those reforms?
Bringing down the price of brand-name drugs isn't brain surgery: High-income nations throughout the globe get prices roughly half of ours by relying on a central payer to use its leverage in negotiations with drug firms — an approach we estimate could save about $154 billion annually if implemented in the United States. Negotiations by Medicare, once supported by Trump, might produce a chunk of those savings.
That correction has been slow-coming when it comes to President Trump and John McCain, because Republicans are terrified of Trump and his sway with the GOP base. They almost uniformly denounced Trump back in 2015 when he first suggested the valorous former prisoner of war wasn't actually a hero. But today, seven months after McCain's death and with Trump re-upping his attacks, they're pained to uphold this very basic American ideal.
The House Health and Welfare Committee killed one proposed measure to outright repeal expansion and a second bill seeking to repeal expansion years down the road if the effort didn't result in expected savings, the Associated Press's Keith Ridler reports.
Here's a running list of countries Trump has insulted:
Take Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who may face a big name Democrat in his 2020 reelect like Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), who is still mulling a bid. Cornyn plans to support Trump in this battle, but building the wall in his Texas could attract all kinds of controversy, including eminent domain battles against the government to retain control over private property.
President Trump praised the move during a lunch with Senate Republicans, and suggested the GOP should embrace a new congressional battle over health-care policy ahead of the 2020 elections.

The phone conversation between Cruz and Trump was described by the White House officials and Trump ally as substantive and encouraging. It was about hearing each side out and getting a better sense of where things stand, they said. A Cruz spokeswoman declined to comment on the call.
There's a parallel effort on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Yesterday, the White House launched its first public service campaign against opioid addiction with a series of ads warning young people about its dangers. The four ads feature actors playing out the true stories of young people who crashed their car or broke their own arm to gain access to painkillers:
One can circulate right-wing memes and fall short of an electoral endorsement, Rizzo said. For me, the red line, and it's specified in the county and state party bylaws, is electoral advocacy of a candidate opposing the Democrat. And 'Trump Train 2020!' is that.
—All the while, older, middle-class people are struggling to afford coverage, particularly in rural areas. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation study released this morning, 60-year-olds with a $50,000 income must pay at least one-fifth of what they earn for the least expensive premiums for health plans in ACA marketplaces across a broad swath of the Midwest, my colleague Amy Goldstein reports. In much of the country, those premiums require at least one-sixth of such people's income.
Trump repeated a version of this claim on Feb. 26.
The Senate, envisioned by the founders to be a highly deliberative body, was created with no mechanism to end debate on a given topic. Senators quickly realized that long speeches could delay action on legislation they didn't like. In the 1850s, the practice of talking a bill to death got a name -- filibuster, from the Dutch word for pirate. In 1917, senators adopted a rule establishing that debate could be ended upon a so-called cloture vote supported by a two-thirds supermajority. That bar was lowered in 1975, when the Senate reduced to 60 the number of votes required for cloture.
The left is, of course, outraged. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called Trump's action despicable, and the New York Times editorial page complained that the rule could devastate groups like Planned Parenthood. That is, unfortunately, a gross overstatement, as Planned Parenthood gets three-quarters of its federal funds through Medicaid, which would not be impacted. But it is music to pro-life ears. And despite Democrats' anger, the new rule should have broad public support. A Marist poll released in January found that 60 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars for abortion, while only 36 percent approve.
He's trying to bully the party, and he's banking on people not being courageous, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday of McConnell's plans. I think people should call his bluff.

-- SCOTUS ruled that a federal law prohibiting the registration of trademarks that officials consider disparaging violates the First Amendment. Bob reports: Justices unanimously sided with the Asian American rock group the Slants, which in 2011 was prohibited from registering the band's name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. The decision is likely to affect the ongoing legal battle of the Washington Redskins, whose trademark registration was revoked in 2014 under the same clause.
And let's talk about this election. The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.
Amy Schulman, a managing partner at venture capital firm Polaris Partners explained that the barriers to women may stem from inadvertent bias, such as prerequisites that turn out to be a proxy for picking a man. For example, if experience as a chief executive and prior experience on a company board is a requirement for a new leadership position, many women would find themselves excluded. Overt sexism may also play a role, including concerns about how public markets or investors will react to first-time female chief executives.
Republicans say the concern is overblown. The waiver does not apply to the large-group market, said Zach Hunter, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The MacArthur amendment explicitly allows states to seek a waiver for essential health benefits only for the individual and small-group market, and it will have no effect on the large-group (employer) market. Any ambiguity caused by previous administrations' guidance from HHS could be resolved by Secretary Price.
Conservatives' best-case scenario would make the AHCA's refundable tax credits nonrefundable, in a nod to antiabortion activists who want to stop women from paying for abortions with tax credit dollars that flow to health-savings accounts. Making the tax credits nonrefundable would reduce their practical value to lower-income people, who have lower tax burdens.
A Republican health-care lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said that insurers are confused and trying to read the tea leaves of Trump's statement.

Arkansas implemented a variation of Medicaid expansion that was offered under the ACA, giving some people federal aid to purchase private insurance. Cotton does not hold a position for or against the program, his spokeswoman Caroline Rabbitt confirmed. Going forward he wants to ensure the governor has the flexibility he needs to help Arkansans adapt to any changes to Medicaid, she added.
This is all about corruption. Everyone here knows that all of our leaders are thieves, said one protester, who wanted to take out a poster but feared arrest. Russian officials had sought to tamp demonstrations before they began, with one senior Russian police official warning Friday that authorities would bear no responsibility for any possible negative consequences for people who did show up. Putin's spokesman said that even telling people to come to the rallies was illegal.
For another, McConnell will be running on a ticket with Trump, a president who enjoys a plus-14 net favorability in Kentucky, at the top. Though the two got off to a rocky start — Trump's early months in office featured a presidential tweetstorm against the senator for his failure to repeal and replace Obamacare — they have since found an accommodation.
You can't say opioid use disorder is an orphan disease because you have over 2 million patients who have that disease, Braeburn CEO Mike Derkacz told me yesterday.
At the time, Republicans got huge pushback from health-care advocates and Democrats who said it would hurt Medicaid enrollees — and they ultimately abandoned the whole repeal-and-replace effort.
For one thing, McConnell doesn't insult everyone on a daily basis, which Bevin did, said Linda Nesbitt, chair of the Campbell County Democrats.
A decline in inspections and a relaxing of penalties have raised quality concerns, Anna reports.

The new lawsuit will likely seek to overturn the entire executive order on similar grounds. A principal argument — though not the only one — will likely be that the measure was intended to discriminate against Muslims, and therefore constitutes religious discrimination against people who are legally permitted to enter the United States, violating equal protection.
As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also. But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they're killing us.
On Tuesday, Trump's new chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who began his job last week, brought on a new communications team, including appointing the White House's fourth press secretary in just over three years. Meadows himself was appointed to be Trump's fourth chief of staff in the middle of the crisis, after the president decided to replace Mick Mulvaney.
-- Sanders, looking for a more emphatic victory than his near-tie in the Iowa caucuses, wrapped up his New Hampshire effort last night with a rally that his campaign said drew more than 7,500 people in Durham. A rock band called the Strokes performed, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) warmed up the crowd at an arena on the University of New Hampshire's campus. Buttigieg's final rally was in Exeter, and actor Kevin Costner introduced him.
Based on conversations with health officials, we believe this approach is worthy of serious consideration, Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) wrote to Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, in a letter shared with The Post.
Booker leaped on the comments, stressing to Barr that his views were a relic of a past age — and coming from the top law enforcement officer in the country, could encourage the sort of racial discrimination that has led to the overincarceration of African Americans.

Here's another idea: Just set health care aside. Republicans can say they're still negotiating health care, says Alice Rivlin, Brookings Institution's health and economics fellow, but they can quietly push it under the rug.
All four expressed no hesitation about maintaining their support for Clinton. Smith went further, first saying that he would vote 18 times. Then he amended his plan.
The boos instantly drowned him out.
In Prince George's, several voters at Friendly High School in Fort Washington said they didn't think Edwards had helped her district. Van Hollen made constituent services a focus of his campaign, saying often on the trail and in ads that he had been more responsive than Edwards.
AHH: A federal judge is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its planned $1.6 billion cut to the 340B federal drug discount program, Modern Healthcare reports.
It appears to be less effective than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which were both more than 90 percent effective. But it was tested in parts of the world were virus variants can elude parts of the immune response, and public health experts have stressed that it prevents the worst outcomes from the disease.
The ad campaign comes as other organizations are ramping up opposition to the Senate GOP effort, he continues. Last week, a coalition of medical and consumer groups held an event in Cleveland that was billed as the first of a series of gatherings to speak out against a bill that passed the GOP-controlled House and the direction that Republican senators appear to be heading.
-- Senate Intelligence Committee investigators are planning to question Jared Kushner about the meetings he arranged with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as part of their broader inquiry into links between Trump associates and the Russian government. The New York Times' Jo Becker, Matthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman report: The meetings included a previously unreported sit-down with the head of Russia's state-owned development bank. Until now, the White House had acknowledged only an early December meeting between Mr. Kislyak and Mr. Kushner, which occurred at Trump Tower and was also attended by Michael T. Flynn.… Later that month, though, Mr. Kislyak requested a second meeting, which Mr. Kushner asked a deputy to attend in his stead. At Mr. Kislyak's request, Mr. Kushner later met with Sergey N. Gorkov, the chief of Vnesheconombank, which the United States placed on its sanctions list after [Putin] annexed Crimea and began meddling in Ukraine. A White House spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, confirmed those meetings, saying in an interview that nothing of consequence was discussed and that they went nowhere.
On the presidential transition website, at greatagain.gov, antiabortion statements and policy positions have appeared that were not part of the campaign's health-care platform. Other proposals have been deleted.
Knox: The other big challenge is China. I know that this isn't the main thing, but one notable phenomenon in recent years has been the way Beijing pressures foreign businesses, including American hotels and airlines and the NBA, etc., to accommodate its view of Taiwan or of the repression of the Uighurs. Do you see a role for federal policy here, or is this simply something the private sector has to manage?
Leave the federal minimum wage at $7.25 per hour, which is already too high. (Trump also promised to raise the minimum wage at another point, which is contained below.)
In many ways, these patterns are surprising. Politicians have expert advisers who can help them direct their thinking. They regularly evaluate ongoing and prospective programs and are encouraged to consider cost-benefit analysis. They are, in theory at least, sanctioned for making poor decisions. But this does not seem to prevent them from stumbling into the same kinds of cognitive biases as the rest of us.
For two years, the nation was transfixed by the legal challenge to Obamacare. A genuine popular constitutionalist uprising had set the stage for a renewal of our Republican constitution. Tea Party activists – and just plain old Republicans – looked to the Supreme Court to uphold a limit on the growth of federal power. True, Democrats and the Left intelligentia would have screamed bloody murder – as they did after the 3 days of oral argument showed there were five votes for our constitutional theory. But, had the Court invalidated the law, polls show it would have enjoyed the support of a majority of the American people.
It has to do with a two-decade-old requirement, first mandated by Congress, that physicians undergo a day's training before being allowed to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid-use disorder.
— New Jersey's Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said the state will run its own Obamacare marketplace in an effort to protect against the Trump administration's moves to undermine the Affordable Care Act. New Jersey would be the 12th state to establish its own marketplace.
Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.
Democrats are outright accusing some Republicans in Congress of trying to undermine the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. And a steady drip, drip of news bolsters their point.
The House committee also is moving forward with a plan to convert the rest of Medicaid to a system in which states would get a fixed sum of federal money for every resident who is enrolled. Such per capita funding, outlined by the chamber's Republican leaders earlier this month, would be more restrictive than the way Medicaid has functioned since its birth as part of the Great Society legislation of the 1960s.
The president is key to getting anything we do in health care across the finish line, and I look at last night as the beginning of that, said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health.
* THE COMING TRUMP POWER GRAB: Paul Krugman speculates that Trump's attacks on the judiciary foreshadow a major effort to seize and consolidate power in the wake of a terrorist attack or other crisis, and asks if there is anything that can stop it:
Those paying close attention, however, perceived that not all was conflictual: Mr. McConnell sided with those repudiating Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.); the president and 10 moderate Republicans both say there should be $160 billion for public health needs such as vaccines. Mr. Biden and a bipartisan majority of the Senate have accepted, in principle, that there should be tighter income eligibility for $1,400 direct payments. By voice vote, the Senate decided to wait until after the pandemic to take up Mr. Biden's controversial $15 minimum wage proposal.
Perhaps more importantly, it would have shown the Tea Party constitutionalists that their efforts had finally paid off. They had put their faith in the Constitution and the courts, and that faith was rewarded. But instead they got a hard kick in their teeth. And the effect of that kick was felt this week.
The law increased the average income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans by $690 per person, and the average income of people in the second-poorest income bracket by an average of $560 per person. (The CBO counted social insurance benefits, including federal health care expenditures, as income for this analysis.)
Disjointed but mostly civil: The tone of the debate was disjointed and civil — with few moments of true roughhousing between candidates. The sharpest exchange was between two Texans — Castro and O'Rourke — in which Castro said he wanted to decriminalize illegal border crossings, and chastised O'Rourke because he didn't.
But in a written statement Friday, Norment said: The few changes to the House's original proposal approved by the Committee today do not narrow the chasm between our respective proposals.
California has issued about 200 permits for a variety of uses, including retail stores, although more than 1,185 licensing applications have been submitted. As for municipalities, some haven't even finalized the regulations needed for a marijuana business to open. They have been accused of dragging their feet or making it difficult for those looking to enter the business to figure out how to follow the rules, Katie writes.
When confronted with untruths, all journalists have one and only one choice: to call them what they are. They cannot, without misleading the public, pretend that there are two sides to a purely factual question. Further, they need to avoid vague language about facts being in dispute when there is absolutely no question about what the facts are … reporters may indeed seem oppositional when they confront an administration that, day after day, shows so little regard for fact or truth. But this is not the media's problem. It's Trump's.
That immediate attack on Trump was a marked shift from Wednesday's debate, in which another 10 Democratic candidates mostly talked about their policy proposals, and spent little time criticizing or even mentioning their prospective GOP opponent.
The estimate also showed that the bill would cut $880 billion from the Medicaid program over the next decade. The program provides health insurance to low-income Americans and helps pay for long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities.
Although an investigation shouldn't be launched just because a President wants it, the ultimate question is whether the matter warrants investigation, Barr wrote.
Alex van der Zwaan, an associate of former Trump aide Richard Gates, was sentenced to 30 days in prison for lying to office special counsel Robert Mueller. (Reuters)
Increasing ACA subsidies and widening who can get them would represent a first step by Congress to embrace President Biden's credo of using the sweeping — and politically polarizing — law as the main tool for improving the nation's health-care system.
Getting rid of those requirements would make it easier for the SSA to administer the benefit, Gleckman said, but in either case the IRS may be better equipped to figure out where to send the money.
Yesterday, the agency sent warnings to 20 separate manufacturers and health care providers in the stem cell industry, saying they are selling an unapproved product in violation of federal laws. The letters are part of an ongoing attempt by the FDA to rein in the booming industry, which critics say has injured dozens of patients and cheated thousands more. In recent years, hundreds of clinics have popped up selling stem cell procedures — not covered by insurance, unproven by science and unauthorized by the government, our colleagues write.
The White House, having promised to overhaul the long-troubled VA, which serves nine million veterans, is now taking more time to vet candidates before putting forward a nominee, Peter writes. One person close to the White House said Mr. Trump has also considered his chief of staff, John Kelly, for the VA job. But White House officials insist Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, isn't a candidate.
You've heard me say before, he told the Kentucky Today editorial board Tuesday, that I thought the decision I made not to fill the Supreme Court vacancy when Justice Scalia died was the most consequential decision I've ever made in my entire public career.
Some aspects of Biden's health-care plans from his campaign are controversial even within his own party, such as a proposal to add a new government insurance alternative to compete with private health plans sold through ACA insurance marketplaces. The greater use of subsidies, however, is a strategy that has consensus support among House and Senate Democrats, from liberals to moderates, though it is opposed by most Republicans.
But seven experts in toxicology, cardiology and illegal drug use who were consulted by The Washington Post largely disagreed with the idea that Chauvin's death was the result of a drug overdose. Several argued that the chain of events that evening inconsistent with a fentanyl overdose, which would have caused Floyd to become quickly sluggish and unresponsive. Instead, video shows Floyd coherently speaking with police and struggling when they pinned him down.
But maybe he does mind. On April 2, Trump brought up old comments from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who opposed the full release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. It's grand jury material. It represents statements which may or may not be true by various witnesses. Salacious material. All kinds of material that it would be unfair to release, Nadler said in 1998, as The Post's Colby Itkowitz reported.
Concerned Veterans for America is now positioned to shape the priorities of Trump's new VA nominee, Ronny L. Jackson, a little-known presidential physician with scant policy or political experience. And the group is gearing up to be a big player again in the congressional midterm elections, investing $3 million so far this cycle attacking vulnerable Senate Democrats as weak on veterans issues — with millions more likely to come.
The administration is also moving ahead to relax vehicle mileage standards set under the Obama administration and increase allowable fossil-fuel emissions. The entire Internal Revenue Service workforce may have been sent home, but the work of increasing global warming must not cease.
It's in the interest of the United States to start becoming a vaccine supplier to poorer countries, said Carlos Del Rio, professor of medicine and global health at Emory University. Other countries are seizing opportunities to build goodwill and influence globally, while the United States is still focusing internally on vaccinating its own citizens, he noted.
Vice President Harris will swear in Gina Raimondo as commerce secretary today at 6 p.m.
The Affordable Care Act, which passed with not a single Republican vote in either chamber, ushered in the most significant expansion of insurance coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Eleven million additional people joined the Medicaid rolls after the ACA allowed states to expand their programs to cover people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which means the system now covers 68 million people.
Trump, who is 72 and 6-foot-3 , weighs 243 pounds, up from 239 pounds last year, and was told to watch his diet and exercise and to lose weight. His heart rate was at 70 beats per minute and his blood pressure at 118/80 mmHg.
I'll be here in about a year and a half campaigning against your governor, Trump said firmly. I guarantee you.
Seth Meyers hosted a debate on Trump's staff shake-ups:
Just six weeks after joining the race, Bloomberg is fifth in the national polling average, garnering about 6 percent among Democrats. He's hired more than 800 staffers, with 500 of them spread across field offices in more than 30 states. The effort has already spent approximately $150 million on television and radio commercials – and another $20 million or so on Facebook and Google ads.
If I'd known now what I didn't know then about him being such a disaster? Yes, I would have voted for her, she said. But with a very shaky hand.
The trade-deficit number is close to correct, but Trump apparently does not understand the meaning of trade deficit. He often suggests this money could be used to pay for his planned wall along the southern border. But that's nonsensical. A trade deficit only means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. No money passes from government to government.
It's true that Trump's ownership of the bill is not the reason that Republicans and voters are turning on the bill. Rather, the CBO's scalding assessment of it appears to be a key cause. But this gets to the core of what is really going on here, which is that Trump and GOP leaders supporting the bill are losing the argument over it on the substantive merits, on multiple fronts, and Trump's mere salesmanship may not be enough to change this.
While some candidates have sought to mimic Trump on policy and style, the GOP front-runners in both states voting this year — former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie in Virginia and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno in New Jersey — are not talking much about Trump on the campaign trail.
RUBIO: ... Oh, excuse me (INAUDIBLE)...
— House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) are hoping to force a vote on the House floor on a bill that would require medical care protections for infants born alive during an abortion procedure.
It's hard to get to any of their goals without a big overall reduction in health care spending on low income people, Isaac Shapiro, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, tells me. The cuts could go after other safety net programs, of course, but the CBPP concluded in a recent study that such cuts would also hit many non-college whites hard, because they rely on such programs to an unappreciated degree. Given the amount of cuts we're talking about, under almost any combination, the white working class would be hit significantly, Shapiro says.
I think he's incredibly competent, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) recently told Politico. I don't share a lot of his philosophy, but I think he understands — as someone who has been at the administration — the importance of the rule of law and compliance.
Except he wasn't, Sarah writes. While the emergency room where Kohan was seen was in his insurance network, the oral surgeon who worked in that ER was not. That's how Kohan ended up with a $7,924 bill from the oral surgeon that his health plan declined. When Kohan saw the bill, he called his insurance plan, which told him it was probably a clerical error and that he would just need to resubmit the claim. The resubmitted claim was denied, and the process upped the bill by $2,300.
Proponents of the legislation deny any budgetary legerdemain. Instead, they argue, Republican senators had to make sure that there was enough money in the bill to maintain consumers' and insurers' confidence in the system as they adjust to the new law.
I think the first thing is to make it clear that there's an expectation that there are no leaks and punish people through internal discipline if there are leaks, Barr said.
Minus Gardner and McSally, McConnell would be down to 51 votes. His other concerns over the past year, someone close to him tells me, have touched on Maine, Iowa, North Carolina and a special election in Georgia. Of the four, it seems his biggest headache is incumbent Republican Thom Tillis in the Tar Heel State. A popular Democrat could probably whip Tillis, but the opposition is having trouble coalescing behind a candidate.
Amelia Fletcher, a registered independent from Moon Township, cast her first-ever ballot for Saccone because she likes Trump's agenda and believes he will support it.
Again, I -- I'm not gonna get ahead of this. I think we're having some serious -- some discussions back and forth with key members of Congress, the House and Senate leadership. When we have something to announce, we will.
Lisa Zarlenga, attorney at Steptoe & Johnson who was the tax legislative counsel for the Treasury Department when Obamacare went into effect, agreed that a new regulation would need to be issued for the new health law. But she added that the agencies could ultimately decide to use the same language in the current regulation that exists under Obamacare.
KELLY: I'm coming to you next. But go ahead.
You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.
RUBIO: All of these companies he has ruined.
— Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering running for president, expressed his opposition to Medicare-for-all during a CNN town hall, saying it gives me another opportunity to talk about the extreme left and the extreme right.
So budget instructions for the year were based on the March 2016 baseline, and the CBO was ordered to do its analysis of health-care proposals based on the old baseline.
South Carolina does not have partisan voter registration, which means people can vote in whatever primary they want. An open primary means that there will be many moderate voters who may not like Trump but don't necessarily swoon for Obama. There's also buzz on the right, for example, that Republicans should vote for Sanders here to elevate his candidacy on the theory that he'd be much easier for Trump to defeat in the fall. This could be a factor in a close race.
-- Paul Ryan has tried to be more cautious than Trump and administration surrogates when it comes to making promises that could come back to haunt him down the road. Asked on Face the Nation yesterday how many will lose coverage under the House plan, the speaker said he cannot answer because it's up to people whether they pay for insurance or not. That prompted criticism.
Isakson splices into his criticism of Trump some very notable winks at the president. The idea that Trump owns all the real estate in New York and is building the greatest immigration system in the world is the kind of thing he loves to hear. So even as Isakson suggests he's about to denounce Trump, he's inoculating himself from the blowback so many Republicans (like McCain) suffered for their Trump-related apostasies.
Cognitive expert Maryanne Wolf says the human brain is trained to latch onto novel stimuli — it's how we detected threats, mates and meals as primitive beings — but its processing capacity can be overtaxed by the churning graphics of TV news. You're getting information, says Wolf, who directs the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University, but you really don't have the time to process it.
I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.
A former prisoner of Cuba said Sanders asked him what's so wrong with the country.
While Obamacare was under consideration, McConnell had strong words for the Democratic majority's tactics. Now, he seems to be using them. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)
Folks and the whole system will live with uncertainty for a long period of time, Dach wrote.
It also seems probable that, now that the tea party is all but over and the fervor over earmarks has had a few years to subside, Americans might have warmed to them. (Sadly, there's no recent polling to say for sure.)
Friday. The Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health will host a meeting on an opioid report on
OOF: In rare public remarks on behalf of some of the family members that control Oxycontin maker Purdue Pharma, attorney Mary Jo White told Reuters the Sackler family wants to reach a broad settlement to end the thousands of lawsuits over the family and company's role in the opioid crisis.
Context: Major bills and Democratic priorities passed by the House are already piling up in the Senate as Democrats have little shot at winning at least 10 GOP votes to send the legislation to Biden's desk. Progressives and liberal activists who have long advocated for abolishing the filibuster are as frustrated as ever.
We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.
They are all out stumping, trying to gain interest, Ernst said of the group of over a dozen candidates who are running for president in 2020. Just as we've seen with Republicans, those on the left keep moving further and further to the left, which is exciting to some of our younger more progressive liberals in the state of Iowa but not necessarily exciting to the mainstream voters, those older Democrats.
Get rid of the H-1B visa program because it's very, very bad for American workers. (He did not get rid of the program, although he tightened the rules.)
-- Charles Krauthammer has died at 68. The Pulitzer-winning columnist, Harvard Medical School graduate and intellectual provocateur left a legacy of acerbic and prolific commentary that helped shape decades of public opinion in Washington and the rest of the world. The cause was cancer of the small intestine, according to his son. Adam Bernstein wrote his obituary: A star of page and screen, [Dr. Krauthammer] was one of the highest-profile commentators of his generation. . . . In addition to his syndicated weekly column in The Post … he was a marquee essayist for magazines across the political spectrum … He also was a near-ubiquitous presence on cable news[.] By any measure, Dr. Krauthammer cut a singular profile in Washington's journalistic and policymaking circles. He graduated in 1975 from Harvard Medical School — on time, despite a diving accident that left him a quadriplegic — and practiced psychiatry before a restless curiosity led him to switch paths. Instead of diagnosing patients, he would analyze the body politic . . . His arguments found favor with the growing tide of neoconservatives in the GOP … Yet Dr. Krauthammer [was] never completely a partisan warrior.
Buttigieg soon started speaking about health care in a more nuanced way, stressing he didn't want to eliminate private plans Americans might like and want to keep. Polls show that while a majority of voters like the idea of a national health plan, support declines if they're told it would end private coverage options.
Trump once said he likes to obey the law, but Stephen Colbert said he isn't so sure about that:
WALLACE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio?
Feinstein urged him to reveal as much as he can, saying, I think there has to be a realization too among the administration that this is an issue of real concern to the people, and to Congress, and we should be able to see the full information that comes out.
Graham also challenged Barr to say whether he would assure that procedures would be followed, and law enforcement agents held accountable for procuring warrants to conduct surveillance on individuals suspected of improper foreign contacts. Barr pledged to.
And that's the final reason the filibuster is probably here to stay. It's what makes the Senate the Senate. The House of Representatives is a place where what the majority wants, the majority gets. The Founding Fathers set the Senate up to be much more deliberative and bipartisan.
While VA officials, including Wilkie, insist the current health system will remain a first choice for most veterans, a shrinking veteran population over all in the United States and more reliance on private providers could lead to the closings of some government hospitals, some veterans groups and members of Congress warn, Jennifer writes.
Last month alone, more than 76,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders to be apprehended. We have to apprehend them. Do you know what a great job — I mean seriously think of that, 76,000 people, many of which are rough people.
Nomani said she doesn't want Fair to lose her job, but thinks an apology and training are appropriate.
We stand by the reality that … the push to eliminate the Affordable Care Act will result in 24 million Americans losing access to affordable health care, Harris said, referring to the CBO's estimate that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance compared to current law. We can quibble over the exact statistics and data based on the source, she said, but there is an undeniable reality that if they get rid of the Affordable Care Act, there are millions of Americans who will lose their health care.
In the 1980s, then-mayor of Burlington, Vt., Bernie Sanders had some criticism and plenty of praise for authoritarian nations. (The Washington Post)
One of the tensest moments of the debate erupted during the discussion of immigration, as Castro and fellow Texan O'Rourke clashed in an exchange. If you did your homework on this issue . . .  Castro said at one point.
That isn't to say that cracks in the party being repeatedly revealed is a plus for House Democrats. But when Republicans pointed out that the anti-Semitism language was the first successful legislative maneuver by the opposition party in a decade, they accidentally revealed something about the risks of party discipline.
After a grueling race, Cruz will return to the Senate. It would do him a world of good to make some amends with colleagues. The Senate, however, strikes us as exactly the wrong environment for him, one that cultivates precisely the wrong habits. He needs to get away from the artificiality, intraparty backbiting and grandstanding for which the Senate is famous, not wallow in it.
• Raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. Trump and congressional Republicans slashed it to 21% from 35%.
It would also have placed financial pressure on states without expanded Medicaid, by reducing federal funding for their traditional Medicaid enrollees if they continue to refuse expansion and by paying for the entire initial cost of expansion.
Biden attempted to filibuster Alito's nomination and said President George W. Bush's choice was too conservative to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who at the time was the Supreme Court's pivotal justice.
Azar also parried lots of questions on an issue near-and-dear to Democrats' hearts, and another promise Trump made on the campaign trail: not to roll back the requirement that insurance companies cover those customers who have preexisting conditions. Azar said that he personally supports affordable health care for those with preexisting conditions -- one of the most popular planks of the ACA -- but didn't weigh in on a Trump administration decision not to defend the ACA in court against a lawsuit from states who argue the whole law is invalid because the individual mandate was eliminated as part of last year's GOP tax overhaul.
— And here are a few more good reads:
TRUMP: You're the -- you're the one. You're the one.
KASICH: Not just talk, but a record of achievement. That's how we'll restore credibility..
I've enjoyed covering Reid and will miss him when he's gone. His wild rhetoric made for good copy and caused his aides indigestion. But in this Age of Trump, I also wonder whether Reid's style — insults, insinuations and sometimes false allegations — helped to clear the way for worse.
Instead, Trump has been issuing infrequent ultimatums. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me, Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview this week, when asked about the health-care bill.
Barr said he discussed the Mueller investigation with White House officials, but not in any detail. Barr also said he spoke with Trump once when he was considering representing the president in the investigation.
When Obamacare was negotiated, insurers were wary that they would for the first time be compelled to accept all customers, healthy and sick, without being able to charge people with preexisting medical issues more — or deny them coverage altogether. The industry accepted that new burden on the condition that the law also for the first time require most Americans to have health coverage — meaning that insurers could count on getting healthy new customers as well as those whose medical problems made them more expensive to insure.
Baldwin also played Trump and Fox News host Bill O'Reilly later in the show.
Fred Hiatt: So hardware store and flower stores become relevant again?
-- On a party-line vote, the Supreme Court decided that federal authorities have broad authority when imprisoning legal immigrants with criminal convictions who may be eligible for deportation. Robert Barnes reports: It does not matter whether authorities pick up such noncitizens years after they have been released from criminal custody, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority in the 5-to-4 decision. Federal law mandates detention for certain immigrants while awaiting deportation proceedings. 'As we have held time and again, an official's crucial duties are better carried out late than never,' wrote Alito, joined in the outcome by his fellow conservatives.
One of the things they've done in the past is cast every new Democratic or liberal move as a harbinger of an impending apocalypse. Obamacare, they said in 2010, would destroy the American health care system. If gay people are allowed to marry, they said in 2004, the result would be the end of families and the breakdown of society. Both predictions proved ludicrously wrong, but at the time, they were highly effective means of motivating opposition.
The meeting in the Capitol basement included presentations from leaders of key House committees and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, and it was intended to give lawmakers more details ahead of a week-long recess where many of them will be ­meeting constituents eager for details on what will replace the health-care law they have pledged to repeal.
Children and farm workers in California will no longer be exposed to this neurotoxic pesticide that can permanently impair the brain and nervous systems, said Ken Cook, president of Environmental Working Group, told Reuters.
U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain's filing calls for a judge to rule that such a facility is illegal under federal law, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Jeremy Roebuck and Aubrey Whelan report. But individuals behind the site, called Safehouse, are pledging to move forward.
There will undoubtedly be some applause and toasts in March, the anniversary of when Congress passed the ACA and President Barack Obama signed it. Democrats have been particularly eager to highlight the law's preexisting-condition protections, which are threatened by a Trump administration-backed lawsuit, which a federal judge is taking a second look at.
Uygur, a former MSNBC host who said that the CNN town hall format was better than much of cable news, suggested that the big networks nonetheless deferred to voters to ask many policy questions. The TYT series would keep the microphone in the host's hand; part of the point would be seeing who is and isn't rattled by that.
There's already a problem with people being offered the vaccine but not getting it.
Castro spoke Spanish in his closing statement, talking about his family and heritage. In his answer to a question about the photo of the father and daughter, used the first names of the two victims: Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter Valeria.

3:05 p.m.: Barr again talks about his Mueller memo
1) Have (guarded) faith in our system. The battle over Trump's immigration ban is not over — the question of whether it will remain on hold goes to the Supreme Court, and the underlying legal dispute still must be resolved. But Thursday's unanimous decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — which kept the hold in place for now — is significant. Crucially, the decision affirmed the role of the courts in reviewing the constitutionality of actions taken by the executive to promote national security … even in times of conflict.
If custody arrangements change in the middle of the year, millions of parents and grandparents who are raising children could miss out on the payments, experts say.
Tennessee became the first and only state to convert its Medicaid funding to a block grant, after federal officials approved the plan in the final days of Trump's tenure in the White House.
Our relationship with the entire world needs to change, Buttigieg said.
State Sen. John Schickel credited McConnell for his steady hand and for staying, by and large, in the good graces of Trump voters who are very, very, very passionate in their defense of the president. But he also said McConnell is walking a tightrope.
I give a final exam in which I ask the students to make one recommendation to the president of the United States to improve the health-care system for everybody. The kid that got the A-plus said campaign finance reform. Not bad. He was scared to death that I'd flunk him but it's a smart answer. Because around each of these changes there's an array of interest groups.
(3) This will be a big issue in November when multiple states (Utah, Idaho, Nebraska) will vote on Medicaid expansion, which delights Democrats. Democrats are returning to their bread-and-butter issues (e.g., wage stagnation, lack of access to health care) as they remind voters which party defended the ACA, and which party voted to eliminate it without an adequate replacement. The Medicaid issue will help the Democratic Party turn out its base, which is already pumped up to cast a symbolic vote against Trump.

In a pair of opinions on Wednesday, Boasberg invalidated the federal approvals and said federal health officials would need to reconsider the Arkansas and Kentucky plans, for a second and third time, respectively, Amy writes.
This action is based on the imminent health risk posed by the contamination of this product with salmonella, and the refusal of this company to voluntarily act to protect its customers and issue a recall, despite our repeated requests and actions, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.
Republican senators offered differing responses to the administration's new court filing, though none offered support for throwing out all of Obamacare without a ready replacement for its most popular elements.
SPICER: They have all the documentation that they've asked for, and we're following the precedent that they sought to have followed both in 2008 and '12.
So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.
Washington is one of 17 states that allow personal or philosophic exemptions to vaccination requirements, meaning virtually anyone can opt out, they add.
-- The Virginia legislature wrapped up the strangest General Assembly session in memory late Sunday, marred by multiple blackface scandals and allegations of sexual assault against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D). Probably the most infamous session since 1861, said Sen. Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax City).
In Florida, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R), the dean of the state's delegation and the first Cuban American elected to Congress, recently announced her upcoming retirement after 35 years in office. Her district — which Hillary Clinton won over Trump by 20 points — is now considered a prime opportunity for a Democratic pickup. Several prominent local Republicans already have announced that they will take a pass on the race.
Now of course, he claims otherwise: We had people working three jobs, two jobs, and they were doing worse than they did 20 years ago. That's not happening anymore.
Heritage's leadership, including its president, former senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), has never ordered us to cover any story in the Daily Signal's existence, Bluey said. I wouldn't work here, and the talented journalists we've attracted to work here wouldn't be here, if we were receiving direct orders from Jim DeMint and the Heritage Foundation.
Without reimbursement, the situation is not sustainable, the associations wrote. Communities risk losing the very emergency medical providers and suppliers they have relied upon to help reduce hospital surge and decrease the infection rate.
Meanwhile, in Arizona, a Marist-NBC News poll has rotten news for Republicans, who hope nominating moderate Rep. Martha McSally would allow them to keep retiring Sen. Jeff Flake's seat. NBC News reports: Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is ahead of all three potential Republican opponents — Kelli Ward by 10 points among registered voters (48 percent to 38 percent), Rep. Martha McSally by 11 points (49 percent to 38 percent) and Joe Arpaio by 25 points (57 percent to 32 percent). A Republican losing by double digits in Arizona should send a wake-up call to establishment Republicans there — they should rally around McSally and then run from Trump.
As the virus tore through the country around this time last year, it concentrated its blow on elderly Italians. Those 80 and older — a group that makes up 7 percent of Italy's population — have accounted for 60 percent of the nation's covid-19 deaths, my colleagues Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli report.
It's really a simple story. Ryan, however much he might want to deny it now, is an Ayn Rand devotee — he has said her philosophy is the reason he got involved in public service, that her books were required reading for his interns and staff, that he thought we were living in an Ayn Rand novel at the start of the Obama years, that American society really was nearing a tipping point between makers and takers, as she wrote, and that he even got his (entirely wrong) ideas about monetary policy from her books — who thinks that letting rich people keep more of their money isn't just good for the country's economy but also for the country's soul. It's the same fear that, historically speaking, a certain type of conservative has always felt about democracy: What's to keep the bottom 99 percent from voting all of the top 1 percent's money to itself? The answer is tax cuts. They're the only thing, from this perspective, that can keep the republic from being corrupted by these demagogic impulses. So nothing could be more important than them.
Silvershow was exactly what Silverman wanted: a spot for her brand of commentary and comedy in the same territory as Oliver and Bill Maher. Without explanation, HBO passed.
KELLY: All right. Stand by. I will come back to you. Senator Cruz wants to weigh in. You're coming back.
To defeat the narrow parochialism that brought us the calamity of the Trump presidency, America needs its own Erasmus program: the kind of deep understanding of another nation and a different culture that a year abroad can offer and thus, hopefully, mitigate the forces that stoke racism, xenophobia and narrow-mindedness. Today, as David Hamburger has argued, government programs sponsoring Americans to study abroad are underfunded and largely out of reach for many. Funding for flagship programs like Fulbright and the Peace Corps in the United States is a fraction of what it is with Erasmus. That's nowhere near enough. In inflation adjusted dollars, Fulbright funding even declined 10 percent over the past decade. A large, ambitious Erasmus-like program targeted at minorities and low-income Americans would not, on its own, heal the rifts that so deeply divide this society. Poor Americans have a hard-enough time financing an education in their own country. For them, studying abroad may sound like a pipe dream. But in fact, other countries educate their youngsters at a fraction of the cost of the American system, meaning an American Erasmus could potentially save as much money as it costs, or more. And it could do this while strengthening America's ties with the world and, thereby, strengthening America itself.

You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.
KELLY: They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced.
And who are these lucky taxpayers? According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, around 90 percent of the benefit would go to households with more than $700,000 in annual income — the top 1 percent — who would no longer have to pay a 3.8 percent payroll tax on the income they make from investments in stocks, bonds and real estate and a 0.9 percent payroll surtax on their salaries. The center calculated that works out to an average of $33,000 per household.
Meanwhile, data filed with CMS show that in 2016, issuers of qualified health plans — health-insurance plans for the exchanges — lost nearly $5 billion, or about $394 per member, in the Obamacare exchanges. This was a slight decrease from 2015, when the plans lost nearly $6.6 billion, or about $495 per member.
Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.
The meaning of a safety net takes on a whole different connotation in this environment, she said. A longer-term scenario puts all of that on the table in a way that we could not have imagined discussing three months ago.

And, as with Medicaid waivers, the agency is expected to dramatically pull back on waivers granted by Verma allowing states to distance themselves from Obamacare.
The Daily Beast's Julia Arciga reports the publication found fundraisers benefiting or promoted by anti-vaccination or 'vaccine choice' groups brought in at least $170,000 in the last four years.
Under the regulations, Bob Mueller could only be terminated for good cause and frankly it's unimaginable to me that Bob would do anything that gave rise to good cause, Barr said. He also said any transgression would have to be pretty grave and that the public interest would have to compel Mueller being terminated.
Ending pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.
The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law holds a hearing on the effects of consolidation and anticompetitive conduct in health care markets.

Today's Supreme Court announcement ensures health care will remain front and center throughout 2020 and that House Republicans won't be able to hide from their long history of attacking Americans with preexisting conditions, said Robyn Patterson of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Silicon Valley asked Warren for help with a fundraiser. Her campaign considered it.

But for a president seeking reelection next year, it is another inexplicable decision, after his embrace of throwing out Obamacare last week. The policy is probably popular mostly with those who would vote for him anyway while being viewed as anathema by many others. (Two-thirds of independents disapproved of it in CNN's poll, for example.)
America's Health Insurance Plans, a major lobby for insurers, said in a statement that although premiums for next year will increase because the individual mandate penalty for not carrying insurance is being zeroed out in 2019, the market has been stabilizing.

Under a new policy set to take effect in June, veterans who can prove they need to drive 30 minutes or more to reach a Veterans Affairs facility will be able to seek both primary care and mental health services outside of the department's system, the New York Times's Jennifer Steinhauer reports. The new rules allow veterans given a wait time of 20 days or more at their closest VA facility to seek outside care, down from the current threshold of 30 days or more.
TRUMP: I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to. It's living in Hell in Syria; there's no question about it. They're living in Hell.
Biden exudes a new sense of urgency as he makes what could be his last stand ahead of Saturday's primary, in which the majority of voters will be black. When we were president – when Barack was president, and I was vice president – we went to HBCUs, Biden said, referring to historically black colleges and universities.
As for the drugmakers — represented by the powerful Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — they're bulking up their defense strategy, as the New York Times's Robert Pear details in this interesting read. The industry far outspent anyone in lobbying the federal government last year, pouring $171.5 million into the effort, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.

In Florida people have ended up camping out overnight for vaccines offered on a first-come-first-served basis. Even so, the Florida Division of Emergency Management announced that its testing and vaccination site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens would close for much of Monday because of a College Football Playoff national championship game.
Finally, conservatives want the Senate bill to repeal Obamacare's insurance regulations — such as the requirement that plans don't charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions — or make states opt in.
Trump kicked off Tech Week at the White House by meeting with some top CEOs, including Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos:
Democrats would probably support such a proposal, given that shutdowns tend to be a weapon used by Republicans. Democrats did force a brief shutdown last year, over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but the last big one came in 2013, when Republicans tried to defund Obamacare. The last lengthy shutdown before that came in the mid-1990s, when Republicans insisted that President Bill Clinton balance the budget with specific estimates.
If the president directs an attorney general to do something that is contrary to law, then I think the attorney general has got to step down, Barr said.
-- The U.S. has officially refused to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the diplomat's wife who fled the U.K. to avoid facing charges for killing a British teen by driving on the wrong side of the road.

To give up the filibuster would be for senators to give up that power to be a check on both the partisan House and the White House.
But the number of people who are working two or three jobs is pretty small — and getting smaller.
Nonetheless, the episode served to highlight the challenges ahead for Ryan in attempting to regain control over the House GOP and maintain a working rapport with the White House.
Trump immediately started blaming Republican leaders in Congress. He has since settled on solely blaming McCain.
— In a long and rambling speech that prompted laughter but also head shakes among attendees, President Trump targeted health care last night at the annual National Republican Congressional Committee spring dinner. He appeared to acknowledge that Democrats have gained the upper hand on health care politically, but vowed once again that the GOP will be the champion of preexisting conditions ... not only for politics, it's also the right thing.
SCHUMER: And I knew what would happen. John McCain again would do what he thought was the right thing no matter what the pressure.
Además, está el tema de la biografía. Biden llega a la presidencia no como un forastero con demasiada confianza, sino como alguien que aprendió el significado de la administración de un cuerpo político complejo a lo largo de décadas en el Senado y ocho años en la vicepresidencia. Ha cometido muchos errores, pero nunca el de sugerir que él solo podría solucionar los problemas de Estados Unidos. Más bien, tiene un historial de cooperación bipartidista, y lo ha defendido incluso contra rivales por la candidatura demócrata. Convirtió a uno de esos críticos, la vicepresidenta Harris, en una aliada histórica: la primera mujer y la primera persona negra en ocupar el segundo cargo más alto de la nación.
Early in the campaign, for example, Trump aide Sam Nunberg was sent to explain the Constitution to the candidate, Wolff writes, and Nunberg offered this assessment of the experience: I got as far as the Fourth Amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.
In other words, while Trump's hunch may eventually prove correct, it will take time to know the true fatality rate for covid-19. During this interview, Trump also suggested the mortality rate was high because many people did not know they were affected and did not report an illness: So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.
It's difficult to say what the political landscape will look like in a year or two. But while the Republican Party may reluctantly allow temporarily increased unemployment benefits, they haven't changed a bit. Consider this story from the Daily Beast:
A narrow majority of Americans favor convicting Trump, per a Gallup poll.
RUBIO: ... let's talk about Donald Trump's strategy and my strategy and Ted's strategy and John Kasich's strategy when it comes to ISIS. And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.
Trump signed the health-care ­order while seated at the Resolute Desk of the Oval Office, which had been redecorated with gold curtains (a change from Obama's crimson drapes). Busts of President Theodore Roosevelt and former British prime minister Winston Churchill were added to be displayed along with one of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.
The two judges also mentioned violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the potential for an undercount, according to career Census Bureau officials and other experts. One judge found that the question violated the Constitution.
This afternoon, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic committee leaders will roll out legislation they say would improve the marketplaces and roll back harmful policies advanced by the Trump administration. The measure – which will include reinsurance programs to help insurers reduce premiums and more generous subsidies to help consumers afford them – is expected to incorporate elements of six bills considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in two recent hearings.
But nobody knows better than Obama what a hornet's nest the GOP is walking into. Now they're put in the position of actually delivering on that promise, and he wants them to bear the burden of the result just as he did.
This afternoon -- and one other note on that. I think you have seen in the last 24 hours unbelievable support coming from pastors and other dignitaries, well-respected folks in government, academia, and religion and business, with an outpouring of support for Senator Sessions, which is truly fitting for the record that he has and the relationships that he's developed over the last couple of decades.

The Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, having helped create a list of Supreme Court candidates, is one of Trump's judge whisperers.
It's a shift some candidates have gingerly begun to make. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) said weeks before announcing his presidential bid that he wanted to take down the border barriers that divide Mexico and the United States. More recently, he has shifted his position.
Cox still describes his support grudgingly, noting that the Republican-led Congress has been unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Obama-era health-care law that laid the groundwork for expansion. But as he seeks to woo House and Senate Republicans, Cox contends having Trump in the White House softens the blow.
If Lamb does win, Republicans will be in justifiable panic. (The difference between a narrow loss for Republicans and narrow win will be psychologically huge, even though both should portend real trouble for the GOP in November.) The problem will remain, however: What to do about it? Republicans from deep-red states will still be petrified to break with Trump; Republicans in swing districts can only run so far from the president (especially if they voted for his tax plan and for his Obamacare repeal efforts). Fears of a blue wave may become a self-fulfilling prophecy as donors decide not to throw good money after bad. Voters become more discouraged, thereby depressing turnout. And conversely, Democrats will receive another shot of adrenaline.
This is what 2020 candidates have said about the escalating tensions with Iran:
The CEA report may have had its intended political impact, but as economic analysis it does not stand up to scrutiny. The improved stock prices of a handful of companies that are no longer in Obamacare is not a useful proxy for the companies still in the market, where many continue to lose money. The report is worthy of Four Pinocchios.
Chafin (Russell) was among a handful of Senate Republicans who agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in 2018.
Mueller is careful to break down direct and indirect costs from his investigation, as we've reported, and is far below what independent counsels spent investigating Clinton.

Fully repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump's promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act backfired spectacularly in his first year in office, and the backlash over repeal votes taken by Republicans helped Democrats retake control of the House in the midterm elections. Trump had made other promises on health care, including letting states manage Medicaid funds and allowing for the purchase of health insurance across state lines, that also failed to be realized.
But Trump suggested he wants to revisit the issue, after two unsuccessful efforts in 2017 to undo former president Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Trump has long fumed over those failures, and as recently as last week was attacking the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) for his pivotal role in quashing the effort.
Bottom line: The moderates who agreed to drop the discharge petition in exchange for a vote on a bill crafted by leadership got burned.
The U-Va. newspaper, the Cavalier Daily, had some more details about Warmbier's life: At the University, Warmbier was a member of the Theta Chi Fraternity and an Echols Scholar. A Commerce student at the time of his imprisonment, Warmbier would have graduated this past spring. Graduates noted his absence with #FreeOtto stickers at Final Exercises in May.
Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I'm going to disavow. And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.
In a surprise flip during the regular legislative session, the Republican-led House of Delegates abandoned its years-long opposition to Obamacare to pass a budget that would expand Medicaid, with the federal government promising to pay at least 90 percent of the tab.
-- The diversity of 2020 presidential candidates — from female lawmakers to a gay mayor and one bachelor senator dating an actress — could force a reconsideration of the first lady role, Karen Tumulty writes: The traditional title of first lady comes with no job description beyond the presumption that she should take on an unobjectionable cause or two and enthusiastically offer her unpaid services as event planner, decorator and catering manager. … The true running mates in 2020 will be a diverse cast. They are male and female, straight and gay. What we can hope is that, at the end of it all, they will have at last written a new script — which is no script at all — for the most difficult supporting role in politics.
There is no average, but I think if you were to come up with an average it would be in the low teens nationwide, Kris Haltmeyer, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's vice president of legislative and regulatory policy, told reporters yesterday.
Half a dozen Trump transition officials and administration advisers attended the gathering, including Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who headed Trump's EPA transition team. Ebell, who disputes the scientific consensus that humans are driving the warming of the planet, received Heartland's Speaks Truth to Power Award.
In quieter corners, some offer more nuanced views. Paul Fiser, a 60-year-old lawyer, faulted Pelosi for going ahead with impeachment despite saying she would not proceed without bipartisan support. But he also criticized McConnell for saying he could not be an impartial juror.
Feinstein — the first woman to lead the Democratic side of the committee — stressed that the presence of Ernst and Blackburn was an especially important milestone, given how just 25 years ago, the then all-male panel had handled the sexual harassment allegations Anita Hill brought against now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
Valde said he knows there have been many problems implementing the law, but he said it allowed his brother-in-law to finally afford health care.
People are just frustrated with how weak the Democratic Party leadership's response has been on this, said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the liberal group Justice Democrats that has talked about challenging Democratic incumbents. The response has been so tepid and lackluster. . . . They seem to be running away from it because they're afraid of controversy and conflict.
The bill signing came shortly after the Iowa affiliates of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union warned that they would sue the governor if she signed the bill, which the Republican-controlled Legislature quickly approved in after-hours votes earlier in the week, Barbara writes.
The second argument I'd make is that cash is much, much harder to demonize than health care. If you go to a conservative in Kentucky and say the government wants to take over your health care, you can get people very, very upset about that. If you say, hey, this cash is going to hurt you, it's going to be tougher. I mean, there might be some someone there who's like, yeah, the cash is going to hurt me, but others would be like, Wait a minute, they do this in Alaska. If I got that money, I think I'd be very productive with it. Sure, some of my neighbors less so, but, you know, first things first. So we can get Americans on board because it's such a simple, straightforward vision of citizenship.
It is one thing to have disagreements and another thing to interrupt our process as we attempt to confirm the next attorney general. And I would hope that every reporter on this line has the same diligence that they pursued President-elect Trump's association or non-associations with random individuals as they do these tactics by the left to disrupt our democratic process.
Accordingly, [Ardern], who forthrightly described Friday's horrors as 'terrorism', is now setting the stage for lasting changes to be made to the country's gun laws, which have allowed those with licenses to possess semi-automatic weapons.
He said he would also add a mild value-added tax, a kind of consumption tax used by European countries.
Joe Biden needs to hire a single figure — a czar, in Beltway speak — to oversee the U.S.-China relationship. This China Czar should report directly to the president and be able to make recommendations across the many dimensions of public policy that are affected by Washington's dealings with Beijing.
He certainly tried to do entitlement reform, said Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.). Unfortunately, it wasn't a priority for a lot of other people in Congress. And, you know, there's only so much you can do. The majority rules in the House, and the supermajority rules in the Senate. Unfortunately, the votes weren't there, but I think he's really done a good job educating the public on it.
Elaine Chao is a most accomplished if not the most accomplished organizational leader nominated by the president (sic) and in business.
That was one of several issues where Saccone never tried to meet or outflank Lamb. On Monday, as he campaigned at Canonsburg's famous Sarris Candies with Trump Jr., Saccone dodged a question about the bill on miners' pensions and accused a reporter who asked about it of talking to liberals instead of real miners.
States, insurers and health providers are anxiously awaiting imminent release of the final rule, which is currently being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. CMS didn't respond to an inquiry about when it is expected to be finalized.
Biden should prioritize Dreamers and keeping families together. As a first-generation American with immigrant parents, I hope Biden is able to make the immigration process more humane. The red tape needs to be cleared, ending the paperwork limbo many immigrants find themselves stuck in.
Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made the rounds on Sunday shows denying that the president was a white supremacist, calling the suggestion absurd. But Trump has yet to explicitly condemn extremism or specifically call for support of the Muslim community. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she told Trump the best support he could provide her country was to send sympathy and love to all Muslim communities.
There could and should be a world where we see the revival of what became known, during the New Deal in 1935, as Federal Project Number One: an array of programs, such as the Federal Writers' Project, designed to provide financial support and work to unemployed or aspiring artists, writers, historians and musicians, sustaining a cohort that included Zora Neale Hurston and Studs Terkel. Federal One was not just about supporting make-work initiatives, as many of the New Deal projects are best remembered, but was also intended to open creative spaces that explored the lives of ordinary Americans. In some cases, these projects helped break down establishment-serving narratives that had concealed the contributions of workers, minorities and women.
In an op-ed published in September, shortly after McCain's funeral, his wife, Cindy McCain, wrote that the institute is now my home, and my mission.
That's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.
And I've run organizations for decades now. And what I say to people, is this. There are three ways you can treat human beings who work in your organization. No 1. you do nothing, then they leave you within a year. No. 2, you tell them how great they are. That lasts for about a year, and then they leave you before the second year. The third thing you can do is you invest in them. You compensate them. You give them raises, and you genuinely value them and then they'll stay with you forever. Right now in the United States of America, we're doing some combination of one and two with our kids. We're saying, Hey, things are great. You can vote. They don't really believe it. If you could look at every parent who could then look at their children and say, when you turn 18, you're going to get $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you, your country values you, and we are investing in you, that is a game changer for Americans of every political party. And there are many people in red states who are already embracing this vision. I know, because I see them every day.
On Election Day in Baltimore, Van Hollen responded to those who said they want to see a woman or African American representing Maryland in a legislative body with little diversity.
So far, Biden hasn't joined the call to end the filibuster. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is holding open the possibility, saying he's watching to see how much Republicans obstruct. The matter could come to a head in coming weeks or months as the Senate turns to key Biden-backed proposals expected to face broad GOP opposition, including a big infrastructure package, a rewrite of voting rights law and changes to immigration policies.
In contrast, Warren and Sanders — who both voted for the ACA in the Senate — continually castigate the country's system of private coverage, which the ACA expanded dramatically. Though Warren seems to have paid a price in the polls for her aggressive advocacy of Medicare-for-all, and release of dramatic cost estimates to pay for it.
That legacy, largely loathed by liberals, emphasized personal responsibility over government assistance and individual freedom over consumer protections. In contrast, the new Biden administration will operate under a very different framework — one that emphasizes expanding health coverage, particularly to society's most vulnerable.
Make sure the $1 trillion infrastructure plan will be revenue-neutral. Trump has made no progress on advancing an infrastructure bill, let alone one that is revenue-neutral.
Pro-life Americans sense that his pro-life record is one of the reasons Democrats have been searching for a pretext to impeach him. And they know a second Trump term would mean more conservatives justices on the Supreme Court, more conservatives on the federal appeals courts and more opportunities to rescue babies from the abortionist's hand.
But the demand for ACA health plans during this early phase of the unprecedented three-month enrollment extension was a fraction of the enrollment during the first two weeks of the most recent regular enrollment time, when 1.6 million Americans signed up during the first half of November, Amy writes.
However, rural communities have long lacked enough health insurance options. Although it's too early to say how well agriculture association plans might work, they could present a viable option under the right circumstances, Mendelson said.
Under the previous administration, Americans saw their premiums skyrocket, and it was the Trump administration that stabilized the market, giving consumers certainty, Deere said.
So, what options do Senate Republican leaders have to try to find a deal on their health-care bill? A couple of not-great options. Like:

-- Collins sent a handwritten note to Roberts before his admonishment of the lawyers for both sides in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The senior senator for Maine, facing a tough reelection fight, told WCSH-TV in her state that the debate had become too personal, and she said she got mad when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Senate Republicans of being part of a coverup. I had heard both sides impugn the integrity of one another and also cast aspersions on the Senate, Collins said. That is just not appropriate. Collins said she's undecided on witnesses but added that the Nadler comments won't affect her decision.

* Rand Paul: The senator from Kentucky isn't going to be the Republican presidential nominee. But he may have a future as a professional political tweeter. Paul's counter-programming of the Democratic debate via Twitter was sardonic and fun — two things politics can always use more of.
But it is a vision for a vast expansion of the role of government in American society. And it was only a few years ago that Democrats were pretty terrified of anything like this that could be labeled socialism-y. In fact, this proposal makes the GOP's attempts to label President Barack Obama a socialist for Obamacare seem quaint. And to the extent that Republicans can make Americans believe this is a step or even a leap toward socialism, that could complicate Democrats' path in 2020.
A spokesman for Energy and Commerce Democrats said the bills were chosen because they're commonsense solutions to lower consumers' health care costs right away.
Not all Senate Republicans welcome a 2024 Trump presidential run — and some efforts to curb Trumpism have cropped up. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a Trump critic, told reporters she couldn't imagine the ex-president getting elected again:
But earlier this month, Trump started giving media interviews that complicated the plans that Republicans were beginning to prepare — for instance, on whether to impose tariffs on companies that take jobs overseas and when to craft legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act.
Democrats plan to pass a resolution calling on Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to use the 25th amendment to remove Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has promised the next step will be to move forward with articles of impeachment against the president for inciting the assault on the Capitol but did not specify a timeline. Some Democrats, however, worry that impeachment proceedings could make it harder for Biden to hit the ground running with an ambitious legislative agenda when he takes office.
Trump's counterargument lacks such detailed evidence. The evidence is, in effect, Trump himself. He makes little effort to make his numbers add up.
Here's Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who worked closely with the White House to make changes to this bill so that Democrats could support it: The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt. Our country has faced immense challenges before, but rarely so many at the same time.
Bring Theology, Philosophy and Poetry Into Schools
Trump, ever fond of promising voters the world, has already pledged that the Obamacare replacement will cover everyone and do so at far-reduced costs. There is a great chance that estimates will say that this bill doesn't do at least one of those — and possibly both. Failing at one of those things would make passage tough; failing at both would make it seemingly impossible.
A correspondent for One America News posted an email in which Roger Stone bragged to Sam Nunberg about dining with Julian Assange:
Since the CDC guidelines were issued in 2016, prescriptions have dropped markedly, with the number of opioid prescriptions issued annually falling from a peak of more than 255 million in 2012 to 191 million in 2017, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. The letter, written by a group including three ex-White House drug czars, says the CDC recommendation of a daily numerical threshold for opioid use has led insurers to refuse reimbursement, pharmacies to erect obstacles to obtaining drugs and risks for doctors who want to give out more, Lenny writes. They said patients have endured unnecessary pain, turned to illegal drugs and even committed suicide.
The plan would allow state governments, pharmacies and drug manufacturers to submit importation proposals for federal approval. However, Food and Drug Administration experts said it could take two to three years for the administration to issue a final rule. While some rules may be done faster, this one will probably be especially complicated — and the administration is months from formally proposing it.
-- The Nationals lost to the Miami Marlins 8-7 despite an early six-run lead, Chelsea Janes reports.

Limiting the program only to people with particular medical diagnoses.
We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.
But some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: GOP leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.
July 24. In a campaign-style event, Trump defends the Senate version of repeal: The Senate bill protects coverage for preexisting conditions, and you don't hear this from the Democrats. They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn't even know the bill. They run out, they say: death, death, death.
The size of rate increases for the coming year vary significantly from state to state, but attention has focused on some marked hikes, especially in states in which some insurers are dropping out of ACA marketplaces. Both the spikes and withdrawals are motivated by the fact that, on balance, ACA insurance customers have turned out to be sicker than expected and thus are using more medical care.
I've written you off as a human being, Fair wrote in one message detailed in the complaint. Your vote helped normalize Nazis in D.C. What don't you understand, you clueless dolt? Fair wrote, later adding: YOU publicly voted for a sex assailant. She went on to say that Nomani pimped herself out to all media outlets because she was a 'Muslim woman who voted for Trump.' 
It was the dinosaur people — not the actual ones in costumes, which were too unwieldy for the madhouse corridors of the Senate, but some of their civilian-dressed cohorts, who came in to protest that the nominee's beliefs were as outdated as a tyrannosaurus rex.
Gorsuch's first confirmation hearing has been set for March 20. He was on Capitol Hill again Thursday, meeting with six Democratic senators and one Republican.
* BANNON CONSOLIDATES POWER IN WHITE HOUSE: Steve Bannon has now been given a seat on the National Security Council, and Politico sums up the influence that he and former Jeff Sessions aide Stephen Miller have amassed:
In the aftermath of that firing, which became known as the Saturday night massacre, the acting attorney general at the time, Robert Bork, signed an order that ensured the independence of Cox's successor, Leon Jaworski.
Last week, Gottlieb tweeted that generic approvals had exceeded 1,000 for 2017:
We're very close to a vaccine.
4. Are there alternatives to ending it?
But so far this year, most of Ryan's rivals have chosen a different path, almost entirely focused on denouncing Trump's policies as un-American, bigoted and inhumane. At the same time, Democrats are proposing policies that are more welcoming to undocumented immigrants than anything offered by President Barack Obama or, in some cases, the party's last nominee, Hillary Clinton.
We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.
And in issuing their dueling statements Wednesday, Schumer and Roberts showed that it might get worse before it gets better — if it gets better.
Biden immediately goes after Trump: Biden used his first question of the night to directly attack Trump, saying that Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation by giving tax breaks to the wealthy. That was in keeping with Biden's campaign strategy: to ignore the Democratic field and present himself as the inevitable challenger to Trump.
In 2015, a 78-year-old woman visited ophthalmologist Thomas Albini after she received stem cell injections made from her belly fat from a Miami clinic. Instead of her macular degeneration getting better, the woman had suddenly lost vision in both eyes, and Albini said he discovered clumps of blood floating inside.
I share those values, but we must win, she said, arguing that the glass of water she was holding could carry a district like hers if it had a D for Democrat next to its name.
McCain has criticized Trump's foreign policy as half-baked spurious nationalism, urged opponents of Trumpism to fight it and tried to torpedo Trump's pick to lead the CIA by urging his colleagues to vote against her.
Andrew Yang: So if you imagine a town of 10,000 adults in Missouri and they're struggling. And then after I'm president in 2021, and Congress says let's pass the Freedom Dividend, then the following year they're getting an additional $10 million a month in buying power in that community. Where does the money go? It primarily goes to local businesses, car repairs they've been putting off, day-care expenses …
In January, Lee and Cruz joined Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in a letter asking Republicans to quickly consider legislation that repeals at least as much of Obamacare as H.R. 3762, which President Obama vetoed in December 2015.

Awful, he said. He's racist. He's untrustworthy. He's immature. Let me think of a few other adjectives.
Earlier this month, Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) rolled out similar legislation which also provides benefits through the Social Security system. Their legislation would require parents to take leave from work in order to receive the benefit, whereas under the Rubio/Wagner bill, parents could choose to keep working full-time or part-time and use the extra funds to pay for childcare expenses.
So I think, as I said earlier to Julie with respect to Obamacare, you know, the commitment is there. There's a lot to be done. And I think we're going to continue to work with Congress to make sure that we have a plan that is something that reflects exactly the priorities and agenda that the president-elect laid out during the campaign.
So he's going to get to work on Friday. And then over the weekend, I think you'll see a continued -- we'll continue to get that information out via the pool, and whether or not we have additional updates throughout the week, we can provide it to you. But I think you're going to see, you know, a lot of activity. He's eager to get to work and eager to start implementing change.
These are not normal times, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told ClickOrlando.com on March 17. The circumstances in which we live in now have no precedent, at least for 70 years, and even there, it's unique.
But like the food stamp program, those benefits may not continue if the shutdown drags into March or beyond. Beginning in March, families could see an average cut of at least $90, or close to 40 percent, assuming the agency spreads the $1.8 billion shortfall evenly across the 19 million households receiving SNAP benefits, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, our colleagues write. When the SNAP contingency money runs out in April, the food assistance program will probably be closed altogether, anti-poverty advocates said.
When you have 15 [cases in the United States], and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.
It's unclear whether the delays are related to the abrupt resignation last month of the HHS official originally in charge of family planning. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said she wants more specifics. A commitment to extending the funding in a timely manner that doesn't disrupt service is good, DeGette said. Better would be concrete details and immediate follow-through.
While Freedom Caucus members played a central role in opposing the bill, Ryan did not mention a significant group of moderate Republican who also had qualms about the proposal. The Post has counted at least 25 GOP members not considered aligned with the hard right who had announced they were opposing or leaning against the plan.
Appearing on a panel sponsored by Facebook and Glamour magazine Tuesday, she implored 18-to-24-year-olds to vote.
-- As the total number of people in mainland China infected by the new coronavirus surpasses those stricken by the 2002-3 SARS epidemic, Beijing has shut down schools indefinitely, Simon Denyer and David Crawshaw report on a special live blog: The World Health Organization said Tuesday that China had agreed to allow global health experts into the country and a top U.S. health official said he had offered to send a team from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to China to help with the coronavirus outbreak. … The death toll has risen to 132 in China, with 6,078 confirmed cases of infection as of Wednesday evening local time — a day-over-day increase of more than 1,000.
The reality: Trump signed an executive order encouraging the formation of health plans across state lines. But there is still a law in place that exempts insurance companies from aspects of federal antitrust law and ensures that individual states remained the primary regulators of insurance.
Those who seem promising targets for fundraising may receive a visit from a hospital executive in their rooms, as well as extra amenities like a bathrobe or a nicer waiting area for their families, Phil writes. And despite concerns about such programs, they are becoming more common. A 2016 survey by consulting firm Advisory Board found out of 108 hospitals, 68 had so-called grateful patient programs.
Democratic presidential candidates have tried to burnish their financial credentials by arguing that new spending can be financed by taxing the wealthy. But this is likely to disappoint.
-- The more than a dozen ballistic missiles that Iran launched last night targeted two Iraqi bases housing American military personnel. Karen DeYoung, Paul Sonne and Dan Lamothe report: The president, meeting late Tuesday night with his senior national security advisers at the White House, issued his initial response on Twitter and struck a less bellicose tone. He suggested but stopped short of saying that there were no initial reports of U.S. casualties. 'All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!' Trump wrote. 'We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.' ...
Not to be outflanked, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) — who months before had already weighed in with a proposal requiring big corporations to set aside 40 percent of their board seats for workers — unveiled her plan for a 3 percent wealth tax on billionaires, or 2 percent on households with assets above $50 billion.
The front-page headline in the Los Angeles Times is: Trump voters would be among the biggest losers in Republicans' Obamacare replacement plan. Among those hit the hardest under the current House bill are 60-year-olds with annual incomes of $30,000, particularly in rural areas where healthcare costs are higher and Obamacare subsidies are greater, Noam Levey writes. In nearly 1,500 counties nationwide, such a person stands to lose more than $6,000 a year in federal insurance subsidies. Ninety percent of those counties backed Trump. And 68 of the 70 counties where these consumers would suffer the largest losses supported Trump in November…
-- A paper trail of the EPA administrator's emails shows he only sent one message to anyone outside the agency during his first 10 months in office, leading some to wonder if he is communicating privately. Politico's Emily Holden reports: EPA says Pruitt mainly holds discussions in person or over the phone, which would explain the meager electronic trail for his external communications. But Pruitt's critics remain suspicious — especially in light of all the steps the agency has taken to conceal his activities … Oversight groups said it seems implausible that someone as active as Pruitt, who meets frequently with political and industry allies, would have sent only a single email to someone outside EPA. Agency records also include evidence that Pruitt has used text messages at least once to set up a meeting with an Oklahoma lawyer.
Sanders's messaging against Biden grew unfocused during the impeachment trial and stayed muddled in the run-up to South Carolina, which allowed Biden to get off the mat. Recognizing this, Sanders has crystalized what will be his five-part case against Biden. He previewed the message during a news conference yesterday afternoon in Burlington, Vt.
Lee Hockstader, editorial writer: To ask you about immigration: The percentage of Americans who were born somewhere else is almost 14 percent today. It's the highest in a century. It's triple what it was the 1970s. And we would argue and, from what I've seen, you would certainly argue, those immigrants have made the United States a more vibrant place, more dynamic place, culturally and economically, in many ways. But certainly there's also been a contribution to social divisions and those have been exploited by the president, among others. So what percentage, is there a percentage of immigrants as a percentage of foreign-born residents in United States that's too high? If it's 14 percent today or almost 14 percent, is 15 percent a problem? Is 20 percent a problem? At what point, is there a breaking point in terms of the number of Americans or residents who were born elsewhere?
Bruce Castor, a magnet for controversy, is Trump's impeachment attorney.
Rogan, the former Fear Factor host and second-tier standup before he launched The Joe Rogan Experience in 2009, chums around with Elon Musk and signed a $100 million deal with Spotify last year. Rogan says the podcast has 190 million downloads each month. Marc Maron reinvented himself with WTF, with then-President Barack showing up at his garage in Los Angeles. Conan O'Brien, with his ever-shrinking late-night show, expanded with Conan Needs a Friend and his Team Coco company producing other podcasts. (Silverman considered an offer from O'Brien's company, but chose Kast Media because she thought Team Coco wanted too big of a revenue share.)
More than one-third of veterans enrolled in the VA system — which serves 9 million veterans a year through 1,200 hospitals and clinics — now receive care from private doctors. But CVA's ultimate goal is to give every veteran the option to see a private doctor at government expense and create a nonprofit government corporation to oversee VA's medical facilities, officials said.
To defend the dignity of every person, the president said, embracing the position of abortion opponents that life starts at conception, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
There are a lot of district court judges, and you can usually find one somewhere in the country that will agree with you, Barr said, noting he took issue when a judge with limited jurisdiction tries to grant relief to people who are not part of the case or controversy being decided.
Another year of stable enrollment through the exchanges directly reflects the strong work CMS staff put into ensuring that exchange consumers experience a seamless enrollment process free from unnecessary hurdles and IT glitches, Verma said in a release.
In view of all this, Bluey said the Daily Signal handling of pool duties isn't really new territory. He said there's a double standard at work in Washington about determining what is and what is not a legitimate news organization.
Kristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life, blamed Congress for the stalled agenda. Before the election, Hawkins had been skeptical of Trump's history and commitment, but after he won, she has regularly raved about him in Breitbart, posted photos of herself with him and her baby and said she'll urge activists at the march to press harder.
SCOTT PRUITT IN THE HOT SEAT:
But by trying a trick that Houdini made famous
Fifth, impeachment forced Democrats to unlock the legislative floodgates and give Trump major victories. Democrats knew that voters saw them focusing on impeachment at the expense of getting things done, so as they voted to approve articles of impeachment, they also voted to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump's tax bill that repealed three Obamacare taxes, and Trump's $738 billion defense spending bill that created his Space Force and enacted his parental leave policy for federal workers, without restricting his use of defense dollars to build a border wall. The effect was the opposite of what Democrats intended, creating the impression that while Democrats were busy impeaching, Trump was busy governing.
The new executive order temporarily suspends entry by refugees for 120 days (Syrians indefinitely) and suspends entry by migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. Now, it's quite plausible that the lawsuit cannot get this policy overturned in time.
OUCH: Hospitals are absolutely swamped with patients struggling with opioid abuse. New government data shows nearly 1.3 million emergency room visits or inpatient stays for opioid-related issues in 2014 — a 99 percent jump for ER visits and 64 percent jump for inpatient care compared to 2005, the Post's Joel Achenbach and Dan Keating report. The rate of opioid-related hospitalizations were highest in Maryland, followed by Massachusetts and D.C.
Just like the First Amendment doesn't allow you to go into a theater and yell fire, he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns. So do you agree with Justice Scalia? And if so, what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment?
Even now, though, Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker is technically in charge of Mueller — having declined to recuse himself, despite past public comments that were critical of the special counsel. While Rosenstein is still handling the routine supervision of Mueller, Whitaker could block steps the special counsel wants to take. And his comments on the special counsel were far more strident than Barr's. He once suggested, for example, that an acting attorney general could choke off the special counsel's funding as a way to shut down the investigation.
Trump and his Republican allies had been on the offensive on health care in recent months, after several Democratic candidates struggled to answer questions about how they would pay for universal coverage and whether they would allow Americans to keep their private insurance.
It's not clear what led to Gooden's mistaken vote on Wednesday. The two-term lawmaker from the Dallas area was always unlikely to support the bill, which Democrats championed in response to mass protests against police violence and racial inequality last year after Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Gooden was among the House Republicans in January who objected to certifying President Biden's electoral victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
In Washington, the White House and Republican leaders in Congress are putting on a brave face about what they can still accomplish in coming months.
We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
Allowing insurers to exclude drug manufacturer coupons from counting toward the annual cost-sharing limit when a generic drug is available. Insurers may also refuse to count cost-sharing toward a patient's maximum out-of-pocket limit if the patient selects a brand-name drug when a generic alternative is available.
It's not putting the heat on our members — the outside heat from their constituents — that would probably be helpful, the aide added.
There's been much debate over how to prioritize groups for getting the vaccines, but putting seniors first in line as they become available is the quickest way to stem the tide of coronavirus deaths. Fatalities still hover around a tragically high rate of 2,000 per day, even as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations decline.
First, Medicare: Many Republicans think the expensive federal system that guarantees unlimited health-care coverage to those 65 and older threatens to bankrupt the nation without spending cuts or significantly higher taxes. Ryan proposed capping the cost by giving seniors a set amount of money to buy their own private insurance. Ryan also proposed changing Social Security to allow younger workers to direct some of their payroll tax contributions to personal investment accounts.
He did not respond and was sphinx-like in his reaction, but I expounded on my concerns, Barr said.
* DEMS HAVE LONG TERM PLAN FOR TAKING BACK HOUSE: The Post has a good report on the current state of play in the battle for the House. It is very unlikely Dems will flip the 30 seats they need to get the majority back. But note this:
Cruz is pushing to eliminate more Obamacare regulations and wants to allow people to buy insurance plans across state lines, among other things. He said Thursday that he believes there is an agreement to be reached.
The channel he created is a rapid-fire cavalcade of headlines. Most stories run well under a minute. Almost all of the reports are read by the anchors over video footage provided by the Reuters, Associated Press and Euronews services, as well as by RT, the Kremlin-funded news outlet that a U.S. intelligence report calls Russia's state-run propaganda machine.
But certainly I think you would be hard-pressed to find any FBI director that wouldn't welcome more tools in the toolbox, Wray said.
But Wilson argued the plan probably would not reverberate in the same way as the Obamacare repeal push. A proposed cut to entitlements in a budget proposal that has no chance of passing the House just isn't going to enter the public consciousness in the same way, he added.
Here in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and surrounding communities such as West Mifflin, an effort to boot some of those members has created a bitter schism. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) is among several elected officials who've called for Chair Eileen Kelly to step down. State Rep. Austin A. Davis (D) resigned his committee vice chairmanship, citing Kelly's inaction over members he deemed Democrats for Trump.
Trump's former doctor thought he had a ticket to Congress. It might not be that easy.
I think it'd be wrong to set like a numerical goal and say, well, you know, you can't have foreign-born Americans above this threshold, because, in my mind, of these people you're describing, they're all going to have kids like me and my brother, probably like immediately, not immediately. But, you know, like the next generation, like all of a sudden, they're born in this country, like and then they're, in my mind, as American as anyone else. So we should have goals that we're trying to achieve with immigration. But I don't think that there is like a numerical target we should be setting either positively or negatively.
1. Making America Great Together (Making America Great)
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) spent last weekend with Trump and Mulvaney at a fundraiser for the senator and golfing at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort. He encouraged the president to go big on health care, telling him 2018 was a political bloodbath because Republicans had no counter to Democrats on the issue.
Industry insiders say Trump's twice-delayed speech may take place Friday, although the White House hasn't confirmed that. When it does happen, get ready for plenty of intra-industry finger-pointing as the president gives his take on the country's unprecedented spending on prescription drugs and how to make medicines more affordable for Americans.
Indivior is committed to helping the patients, families and communities impacted by the opioid epidemic, and delivering new treatment options for moderate to severe opioid use disorder, Indivior said in a statement.
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.
We're a bipartisan organization. And sadly, it's gotten much, much more difficult to get Democrats to speak at the March for Life or just to be involved in the pro-life movement, she said. We very actively pursue pro-life Democrats.

Meanwhile, Cruz hinted at some of his own priorities in his interview with Kudlow.
Carney immediately scrambled to reverse her vote, but under House rules, votes can't be changed if they would affect the outcome. Thanks solely to her error, fracking was legalized in the state.
Duckworth told Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times she is six months along and, just six weeks shy of turning 50, that she felt great about motherhood and the demanding role of being a senator. As tough as it's been to juggle motherhood and the demands of being in the House and now the Senate, it's made me more committed to doing this job, she told Sweet.
Proponents of reinstating earmarks, such as Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), say problems can be solved if there is more accountability, like attaching lawmakers' names to individual earmarks. Some also say that getting rid of earmarks handed over Congress's spending authority to the executive branch. (In the meantime, lawmakers have increasingly figured out ways to get around the ban.)
I'm surprised that he did that. I've met him a number of times, Trump told the Daily Caller about Northam's remarks. He said he hadn't heard Northam's interview but saw the video of Tran's remarks.
Trump wasn't respectful, she said — to women in particular.
Along with counseling and behavioral therapy, taking a drug like buprenorphine can greatly increase the likelihood people remain drug-free.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat, had said she would seek to be reassured that Barr will treat Mueller fairly, while Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) had said that Barr already has intimated he is committed to allowing Mr. Mueller to finish. Barr has raised questions about Mueller's probe publicly and to Justice Department leaders.
But Williams, the Democrat, left disappointed. She thought Buttigieg should have taken more questions from the audience rather than spending most of the event delivering a stump speech. Williams plans to catch a few more of the candidates if she can but is most intrigued by billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, who she thinks might be able to call Trump's bluff on the economy.
As recently as 2017, Planned Parenthood honored Collins as an outspoken champion for women's health, the Associated Press's David Sharp reports. Now, acting Planned Parenthood president Alexis McGill Johnson says it's clear that she has turned her back on those she should be championing.
The question of whether the government should start negotiating how much it pays drugmakers for older Americans on Medicare has long been a partisan dispute, ever since the 2003 law that created Medicare drug benefits prohibited such negotiations.
It's very unfortunate, through this murder, that he has set back our foreign policy relations.
There is a better way. In December 2019, a consortium of influential religious organizations and the American Unity Fund, a center-right LGBT rights group, unveiled the Fairness for All Act. The proposed legislation expands federal LGBT civil rights protections to cover public accommodations, education and more, but it also includes carefully negotiated, narrowly drawn exemptions for religious businesses and organizations. Beyond its legal fine print, the Fairness for All Act shatters the wall of opposition to LGBT protections among religious conservatives — a political breakthrough.
[F]ar from the nation's capital and in an area not dominated by federal workers, the government shutdown is resonating in an unusual way. A trampoline park is giving government employees and their families an hour of free jumping. A local credit union is offering low-interest loans for furloughed employees who need to replace lost salaries. Some local governments in the area are beginning to allow federal workers to defer payments on property taxes, utility bills and parking tickets. Food drives are being discussed to help Transportation Security Administration workers at Detroit's airport, and a yoga studio is offering free classes for federal employees.
OHOH: What Atnas shouts at the South Pole as he slides up your yenmich (Jon Gearhart, Des Moines)
What's going on now between Trump and Republican leaders has some echoes of the dynamic during the presidential campaign: Ryan and other GOP leaders would highlight their agreements with Trump (repeal Obamacare, get a conservative on the Supreme Court, tax reform), but there were also very conspicuous disagreements (a Muslim ban, NATO, that darn Russia thing again).
You open the door to not just replacing face-to-face visits with telehealth visits, but open the door to a massive set of services that get utilized at a high rate that would not have been utilized otherwise, Mostashari told me.
What might they see? Why nothing less marvelous than the card catalogues of the Library of Congress or Federal Government archives, among other wonders. The government was dipping its toes into this new technology and would soon take the plunge.
Perriello has used his youth and his social media savvy to stir up Democrats who felt shocked by Hillary Clinton's defeat last year. His populist message, perhaps the most strident of any Virginia Democrat since Henry Howell in the 1970s, has packed town hall meetings.
I beat -- and I have not started on Hillary yet. Believe me, I will...
Still, Senate rules dictate that only measures with a discrete budgetary effect are permissible under reconciliation. So while Republicans could claim that the bill repealing Obamacare also contains a blueprint for its replacement, major parts of that replacement plan would need 60 Senate votes — and thus significant Democratic support.
Other countries have looked at this and said you can't have trillion-dollar tech companies like Amazon paying zero in taxes. So they have a value-added tax at the point of sale. It's very hard to game your way out of, generates significant revenue from the people that are winning the most, and one tremendous thing about the value-added tax is you can scale it up on things like AI and yachts and luxury watches, and then exempt it or reduce it on diapers, milk, toilet paper and things that everyday Americans consume. Conservatively, an effective value-added tax at even half the European level generates almost a trillion dollars in revenue with a giant up arrow attached to it because that level is going to increase over time. That's a huge down payment on this $1,000 a month for each of us.

Operation Warp Speed has pumped billions of dollars into vaccines and therapeutics and is considered one of the Trump administration's few successes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two vaccines have received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and at least two more could seek the agency's green light in the coming months, Rachel writes. Still, it wasn't obvious that Biden would keep on Operation Warp Speed leaders, given his criticism of the Trump administration for the slow pace of vaccinations.

But here's what's going to happen:
All of the voters I spoke with at Biden's rally said his background as Obama's wingman is an important asset weighing in his favor. Since Iowa, though, you hear much less from attendees at his events about electability and much more about likeability. Allison Pryor, 57, a retired probation and parole officer who lives in Charleston and is African American, said she'll vote for Biden because he seems so relatable. She appreciated his perseverance after his wife died in a car crash and his son died of brain cancer. He rode the train, and he's always been like a cup of coffee: Regular Old Joe, said Pryor. Yes, it's good to know he'd be a continuation of the Obama administration. But I think he can also stand on his own merits.
Bring the coal industry back to life in the Appalachian Mountain region. (Mining and logging were up slightly early in the Trump administration but down since the pandemic. West Virginia, in particular, surged before the pandemic but has been hurt since then.
Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) told our colleague told our colleague Bob McCartney last week he'd be willing to make an exception and allow simple majority for the passage of bills protecting voting rights:  I am still hopeful that the Senate can work together in a bipartisan way to address the enormous challenges facing the country … But when it comes to fundamental issues like protecting Americans from draconian efforts attacking their constitutional right to vote, it would be a mistake to take any option off the table.
Yang got the biggest audience yet for his basic pitch and his go-to laugh line: The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math! But he took it seriously, as an attempt to meet voters before the celebrity candidates rolled in.
In the past week, the Justice Department sought to expedite the legal challenge to the law, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to hold oral arguments in the case in July. The lawsuit, spearheaded by conservative states and embraced by Trump's Justice Department, would destroy the ACA, upending coverage for 12 million people newly eligible for Medicaid and 9.2 million more who receive federally subsidized coverage via the law's state-based marketplaces.
Trump had little or no interest in repealing Obamacare
If you're part of a typical American household, your family spent almost $12,000 on health care last year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in New Year's Eve address. About one in five of you — including people with insurance — didn't fill a prescription because you couldn't afford it.
TRUMP: ... But it was elevated to an A...
Key excerpt: You need a son of a b---h as your chief of staff. And you need a son of a b---h who knows Washington, Ailes told Trump not long after the election. You'll want to be your own son of a b---h, but you don't know Washington. Ailes had a suggestion: Speaker Boehner. (John Boehner had been the speaker of the House until he was forced out in a tea party putsch in 2015.) Who's that? Trump asked.
Part of my desire to see such a revival is selfish. As a writer, I want creatives like me to be able to work, and some estimates point to a significant loss of income for 95 percent of us during the pandemic. But more broadly, we need to return the arts to being a functioning part of our everyday lives, especially in a moment that will be bordered on all sides by unprecedented national grief.
Hillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.
He's a terrific guy, and I wish him the very best, Romney responds on Fox News. I hope he runs. Come on in, the water's fine.
House and Senate Democratic leaders acted together earlier this week to forge a covid-19 response plan, preempting the Republican White House. By moving first and keeping partisans on the same page, they set the agenda with a list of concrete policy steps to help mitigate the impending emergency. In contrast, House and Senate Republicans were relatively mute, deferring to President Trump and his economic team to float potential options. Even after the president's speech on Wednesday night, the administration's policy agenda remained in flux.
This budget says a lot about the President's priorities: cut $845 billion from Medicare, while spending billions on his vanity project, the wall, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) tweeted, referring to Trump's request for border wall funding. This would hurt our seniors and is yet another piece of evidence for why we need a new president.
Arizona. In a blow to left-leaning Democrats, and a win for the national party, Rep. Ruben Gallego opted out of the 2020 race against appointed Sen. Martha McSally (R). That ended the threat of a serious primary challenge to Mark Kelly, the husband of former congresswoman Gabby Giffords who became a prominent gun-safety activist after her near-fatal 2011 shooting.
He'll continue to advise us and be on that unofficially, and not as an official part of the transition. But he has been tremendously gracious with his time and counsel and guidance. We appreciate his continued support. That -- that was my fault for getting ahead of what we thought was his addition to the team.
-- The city did eventually recover from the destruction of 1968, Ann, Danielle and Michael write. Most of the riot corridors now brim with prosperity. But in many places, … redevelopment took more than 30 years. In the end, many black Washingtonians found that the rejuvenation did not include them.
Every day that passes is potentially hindering relief in the case, NAACP general counsel Bradford Berry told The Post.
In the West Wing, frustration abounds. For a president fixated on winning, people close to him say he is anxious to find out what went wrong with his team's health-care push and get to a deal on that issue or another front such as taxes or infrastructure as fast as possible.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) says the workplace harassment bill she introduced with Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) will change Senate culture:
In a statement Saturday, Labrador said his answer to the woman's question wasn't very elegant. He also criticized the media for focusing on a small portion of an exchange that lasted about seven minutes.
This presidency has exposed the spiritual, moral and racial condition of this nation, he said. The racial divides go deep in this country, and they've invaded the church.
It was a dramatic moment because McCain returned to the floor after being diagnosed with brain cancer — and McCain's was the decisive vote. It looked like Obamacare was dead, and McCain came in for some very tough criticism from liberals and the left.
While manufacturers set the list price for insulin, pharmacy benefit managers play a critical role in the pricing of insulin on which people living with diabetes depend, the senators wrote. It is unclear whether PBMs are appropriately leveraging their power for the benefit of taxpayers and patients.
We think the [ACA] authority is pretty tremendous, the official said. The administration is arguing in federal court to overturn the law, however, with a decision expected in late summer or fall.
In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled the federal government couldn't constitutionally mandate states provide health insurance coverage, Goldstein reported previously. But the three-judge panel punted on how much of the rest of the law to send back to a lower court. Democrats are hoping for a Supreme Court ruling before the November election.
CRUZ: Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17. And, that's why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I'm saying on immigration, I don't believe. I'm not going to build a wall, I'm not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.
Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK? With letters, with this. Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific. Let's see what happens at the end of three years.
The Friday deadline gives the court the option to take up the case during its current term, which would mean a ruling on a contentious issue this spring, just as the presidential campaign heats up, NBC News's Pete Williams reports.
It was our preference initially to get these documents and testimony voluntarily, Schiff said. It's now going to be necessary to subpoena it, and if the General refuses and does so without a good legal basis, then I think we do have to explore the use of contempt.
-- A new report alleges that U.S. airstrikes killed 14 civilians in Nairobi in five airstrikes between 2017 and 2018. Max Bearak reports: The accuracy of the U.S. military's drone strikes in Somalia has come under increased scrutiny since President Trump relaxed rules of engagement there in March 2017, when he declared the southern part of the country an 'area of active hostilities.' Since then, the number of strikes — carried out by Reaper drones and manned aircraft — has dramatically increased, as have worries about a possible civilian toll. ... In response to the report, U.S. Africa Command released its own assessments of the five highlighted strikes and maintained that they caused no civilian casualties, arguing that Amnesty's capability to gather intelligence in a war zone couldn't compare to the military's. The report says the civilian casualties it documents resulted from strikes that 'may amount to war crimes.'
Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.
My brother died because he was poor and could not go to a doctor because he couldn't afford the bills. He is dead. People die because they don't have access to healthcare, one Facebook user wrote.
I know they talk about a lot of corruption and everything, she said, but I prefer to have someone more well-versed in politics than a joke, to be blunt.
There is a bipartisan group in the Senate trying to put a deal together. Powerful GOP senators such as John Cornyn (Texas), Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), John McCain (Ariz.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) support dreamer protections.
A quarter of Americans skip medical treatments because of high costs, and 15 million Americans have deferred buying prescription medications because of the cost, the survey found. Given the choice between freezing their health care costs for five years or getting a 10 percent bump in household income, 61 percent of respondents said they preferred freezing their medical costs.
Amy is a moderate and has served as a moderating influence on Beto's politics and life: She's quick to remind him how his casual profanity might rankle Texas conservatives, not least his in-laws. She's the one who tells him to stop doing push-ups before bed because it's keeping him awake at night. ... When Beto publicly suggested tearing down El Paso's border wall, for example, she was the first to suggest he rein in the rhetoric.
— In an op-ed in The Post, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the Trump administration took significant action but that the need for additional measures is urgent.
TRUMP: So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have= representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully — they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
This data shines a light we've never had before, longtime federal prosecutor Robert Cessar told Sadie. We don't need to have confidential informants on the street to start a case. Now, we have someone behind a computer screen who is helping us. That has to put (doctors) on notice that we have new tools.
Welcome to The Daily 202, PowerPost's essential briefing for decision makers.
Barr made his comments as part of a defense he offered for his hard-line position on prosecuting drug offenders — something he said he pursued as a response to community leaders who, in the early 1990s, were appealing to the administration to do something about the crack epidemic. He said that the administration should listen to community leaders again who are testifying that those harsh penalties were incarcerating too many individuals and thus, ruining lives.
That was a quote I heard a lot. … The idea was that even if this program might benefit me, I'm not gonna support a program that might also benefit by his estimation undeserving immigrants or minorities, Metzl told me in the latest episode of Cape Up. Part of the jumping-off point of the book is how powerful is this idea about what it means to be white in America and this idea that basically to be white means to have to block the advances of other groups.
I'm not sure I've seen anything like it, at least in recent years, where so much ­high-profile stuff has to be done right out of the gate, Jim Manley, former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, told Jeff.
-- The GOP makes the case to prevent late-term abortion. Every day since Trump's State of the Union speech, House Republicans have unsuccessfully sought unanimous consent for a bill that would require medical care for babies who survive attempted abortions, Sean Sullivan, Anne Gearan and Mike DeBonis report. They have promised to try again in the Democratic-led House on Friday. In the Republican-controlled Senate, GOP leaders have rallied around a similar proposal. ... Republicans are seeking to paint Democrats as a party out of step with the mainstream on several issues, including taxes, health care and abortion rights.
There is much for this crowd to celebrate. The conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. Brett Kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his Yale Law School days, has just been elevated to the Supreme Court; he is the second of President Trump's appointees, following Neil Gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. They join Justice Clarence Thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the Federalist Society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), Chief Justice John Roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and Justice Samuel Alito (a periodic speaker at society events). The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning. In practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.
Trump has focused like a laser from Day One on keeping his base in line. At times, when he was particularly out of favor with the American public, it was basically all he had. But however gruesome the tactics have been — particularly in the case of McCain — there is little doubt that they have proved effective. Even GOP retirees and moderates have been reluctant to say what they apparently truly think about what Trump is up to.
My guess is that there is an audience for this message right now — there certainly is one nationally, said Bob Holsworth, a longtime Virginia political analyst. It's the argument that the system is rigged . . . that both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders articulated during the [presidential] campaign. Perriello has embraced that.
He saw Trump's victory as a triumph of bigotry.
This budget is hard for some of those guys, Minority Leader David J. Toscano (D-Charlottesville) said later, referring to Republicans. I think we have to respect their strongly held views. I think we have to convince those who were reluctant that it's ultimately going to help their constituents.
For abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said he needs to get to know Donald Trump before he can consider backing the presidential hopeful. Ryan was speaking after Republican leaders' weekly meeting May 11. (Reuters)
Since then, Democrats have said there's no longer any money on the table for a wall. They have suggested opening up the shuttered agencies unrelated to national security and then having a separate debate about the Homeland Security budget.
There are times we will look at someone eating alone in a restaurant and we feel like we can't go on, says Susan Silverman, a rabbi in Israel and one of three older sisters.
Some House Democrats hope to impeach President Trump for a second time for high crimes and misdemeanors. Here is what that accelerated process might entail. (The Washington Post)
On Capitol Hill: The Senate will convene at 2:00 p.m. and proceed to executive session to resume consideration of Seema Verma to be Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Now the court's refusal to expedite the case saves Azar and Trump from having to conjure up a replacement out of practical necessity.
But there is no magic here. In a regulated insurance market, every dollar of reduced premiums for the young will be offset by an increase in premiums for the old. Some will pay it (those will tend to be the ones with chronic illness), but some of the healthier and less affluent ones will decide they cannot afford it and go without insurance. And if they are unlucky and they do get a serious illness, they too will wind up in hospital emergency rooms, where the cost of their care will be shifted to everyone else. Again, the zero-sum game.
Mr. Secretary, you said you wanted to get tough on drug companies, she said. But under your approach, it seems that the drug companies can just keep charging people more and more. The only thing you've done is set it up so maybe if a drug company reduces a price, you can give them a cheap P.R. moment and then let them jack up prices later.
WARREN: You're looking around: Is there anybody else who might vote to save health care for all of these families? Where's John McCain? And he's not there.
Andrew Yang: I'm 100 percent confident because of both what I saw over the last number of years in the markets that have been hit by the automation of manufacturing jobs and the numbers on the ground throughout the country. So first, what many people cite is they say, Hey, the United States of America has been through this before with the Industrial Revolution. What they don't seem to remember is that the Industrial Revolution, at the turn of the 20th century, included mass riots that killed dozens of Americans, caused the equivalent of billions of dollars worth of damage, led to the origination of labor unions that fought for worker rights, Labor Day as a national holiday and the implementation of universal high school in 1911, in part to try to educate a population that was struggling with the transition. And that our best experts in the field, McKinsey, MIT, the Obama White House, all say that this fourth industrial revolution will affect two to three times the number of workers on an annual basis than that one did. So even if you were to use history as your template, you'd expect there to be massive problems during this time.
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.
AHH: Allowing states to set up work requirements for Medicaid recipients is actually one of the least controversial things Trump has done as president, our colleague Aaron Blake argues. After all, Americans have supported mandating work requirements for government assistance for years.
RUBIO: Well, I know I've talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well. What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the -- both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.
Fifty-three percent of voters said they were less likely to support the legislation when taking into account the CBO estimate that it would lead to 24 million fewer people having health insurance in the next decade. And 59 percent of voters, including almost half of Republicans (49 percent), said they were less likely to support the bill because the CBO projects it could increase average premiums by 15 to 20 percent in its first two years after becoming law.
The alleged missteps that preceded McFarland's failed transplant — which have not been previously disclosed — illustrate what critics say is a lack of public accountability in the U.S. transplant system that undermines patient safety, Lenny writes. They say the system's main actors are not required to reveal most mistakes to the government, the rest of the medical establishment or the public. Largely free of such oversight, they are rarely held publicly responsible for errors.
They're trying to hide how much they're taking out of the program, said Linda Blumberg, an economist at the Urban Institute. If you put it at the end of the budget window, it doesn't look as bad. Don't be fooled. This is a very dramatic difference.
HOT ON THE LEFT: Phoenix Police Refute Cindy McCain's Story of Human Trafficking at Airport, from the Daily Beast: Phoenix police on Wednesday disputed Cindy McCain's account of human trafficking at an Arizona airport. McCain had told local news station KTAR on Monday that she intervened at Sky Harbor International Airport last week when she spotted a woman with a child of a 'different ethnicity.' … Phoenix Police Sgt. Armando Carbajal told KTAR that police conducted a welfare check on the child and found 'no evidence of criminal conduct or child endangerment.' McCain—who is reportedly the co-chair for Arizona Governor's Council on Human Trafficking—responded on Twitter Wednesday evening, apologizing if 'anything else I have said on this matter distracts from 'if you see something, say something.' HOT ON THE RIGHT: A Boy Scout took a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance. The mayor endorsed his 'expression of conscience,' from Eli Rosenberg: Cub Scout Pack 451 in Durham, N.C., was invited to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at city hall, and 10-year-old Liam Holmes did not hesitate. As the group began to recite the pledge Monday, Liam, a fifth-grader, dropped to his knee in a silent protest. It was a style he had seen made popular by National Football League players, placing his hand over his heart. … Durham Mayor Steve Schewel began the meeting by thanking the boy.
— Yesterday, First Lady Melania Trump announced her new Be Best campaign to bring attention to childhood well-being, social media use and opioid abuse. I feel strongly that as adults, we can and should 'be best' at educating our children about the importance of a healthy and balanced life, Melania said at her launch in the Rose Garden.
The media were the ones who told you Obamacare was great. The media were the ones who didn't report that Hillary Clinton got all the debate questions in advance. The media were the ones who said I couldn't win. The media is lying to you now because they don't want you to know all the good things I am doing.
So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything.
From the Fact Checker: 'Metering' and the deaths of the Salvadoran father and daughter
Shutdowns are all about branding for members, write political scientists Andreu Casas and John Wilkerson, who closely studied the 2013 shutdown for the messages members tried to communicate during and after the event. Those in safe districts, where Obamacare was especially unpopular, used their militance to highlight their die-hard opposition to the ACA.
• Give the 21 million Americans who work for the federal government and state governments the right to unionize, which currently exists only in some states.
3. Closing the doors empowered leaders – and avoided a partisan debacle
Holtz-Eakin said he would expect insurers to flee the exchanges even faster than they are under current policy, driving up premiums and forcing the federal government to increase subsidies to keep up with the skyrocketing rates.
Republican senators have increasingly disagreed with one another. As we wrote last spring and summer, these fractures are undermining Republicans' attempts to legislate.
The county committee chairwoman, who works for the Pittsburgh city controller, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In a news conference after the Kass endorsement, Kelly said, There are no Trump supporters in the committee. She dismissed the Anesin photo, too. Well, you have to know this gentleman, she said. He was doing it out of fun.
At the same time, the part of Medicare that covers hospital costs for seniors is running dangerously short on funds. It's projected to become insolvent by 2024, two years earlier than expected. That's closest to insolvency Medicare has been since 1971, when its trustees projected a two-year insolvency window.
His efforts appeared to have cut into Edwards's strength with African American voters. Early exit polls showed Van Hollen winning three-quarters of the white Democratic vote, while Edwards was getting roughly two-thirds of the black Democratic vote.
According to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the changes would cost $52.6 billion. Another $6.3 billion under the plan would eliminate reimbursements people with ACA health plans ordinarily would be required to pay if they misjudged how much income they expected to earn in a year — and thus were given larger subsidies than they deserved, Amy writes.
TRUMP: We made a mistake going into Iraq. I've never said we made a mistake...
Now, there are several reasons why I'm not worried about the Ivanka Trumps of the world. As you likely know, I want to pay for this through a value-added tax that would fall most heavily on the big winners of the 21st century. So someone like Ivanka would end up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars into the system. And so if we try and send her $1,000 a month to remind her she's an American, it's immaterial in the scheme of things. And the benefits towards making it universal are much, much higher than if we have to try and ascertain whether these people truly live together, like whether they got a fake divorce so that one of them could report zero incomes, so they could get an extra $1,000 a year. All of the administrative issues essentially disappear, and this becomes something that we can all get behind as owners and shareholders of the richest, most advanced economy in the history of the world.
How can Congress avoid another government shutdown?:
Warren and Klobuchar talk about prosperity: The first question of Wednesday's debate went to Warren — and it was on a subject she's had lots of experience addressing. Savannah Guthrie of the Today show asked Warren if her far-reaching plans for overhauling the rules of the U.S. economy and the way the federal government runs are too risky.
Trump's proposed cuts would cause layoffs of federal workers — an effect that would be felt heavily in the Washington region: One economic analysis says the reductions outlined so far by Trump's advisers would slash employment in the region by 1.8 percent and personal income by 3.5 percent. Budget experts stressed that it is unclear what the exact impact on many agencies may be, because each department could choose to implement the reductions in a variety of ways. Moreover, the effects cannot take effect unless they are authorized by Congress.
Anthem has already signaled its intent to participate next year in exchanges in some other states, including Virginia and Connecticut.
Restore the Secure Communities deportation program, which was ended by the Obama administration in 2014. The program was a partnership among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that worked together to identify and deport undocumented immigrants. (Trump's attempt was blocked by a judge.)
Fentanyl is sort of the new crack, Barr said. And they're coming in from China.
That has not stopped Northam from trying.
No matter what happens to American evangelicalism, it is here to stay. It's international, global and politically diverse, he said, pointing out that evangelicalism is quickly spreading in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
There are clear echoes from Biden of Clinton's messaging after Super Tuesday four years ago. In an interview that aired this morning on NBC's Today show, Biden said it's ridiculous for Sanders to say that the establishment was responsible for his wins on Super Tuesday. You got beaten by overwhelming support I have from the African American community, Bernie, said Biden. You got beaten because of suburban women, Bernie. You got beaten because of the middle-class, hardworking folks out there, Bernie. You've raised a lot more money than I have, Bernie.
HHS is currently working with the president on a comprehensive strategy to solve these problems, Azar said. We'll be building on the proposals in the president's budget, but he wants to go further.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Ca.), who is running for her party's presidential nomination:
And there is no doubt that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package is enormous — roughly 40 percent of the whole federal budget and about 9 percent of gross domestic product. If you stacked up all that money in dollar bills, the pile would reach almost half as high as Donald Trump's self-regard. As I said, just huge.
The White House disagrees, pointing to moves by the administration that encourage insurance companies to provide free coronavirus testing. On Friday, Trump gave his support to bipartisan House legislation that provides free coronavirus testing for uninsured people.
Most of the Democrats making this argument, like Hickenlooper, Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg, have yet to declare their candidacies. But the Democrats showing up at town halls look much like the ones who powered the party's massive 2018 gains in the House — generally liberal, frustrated with Trump and fretful about divisiveness, not wearing candidates down with policy demands.
HHS is likely to reverse rules that expanded the length of time people could be covered by short-term, limited-duration health plans from one year back to three months, as under the Obama administration. In a marketplace regulation expected this year, the agency is also expected to advance changes that could marginally enhance insurance subsidies and tweak how the exchanges operate.
If you're in the House, what you should be thinking now is that if it doesn't survive, it all comes back to you, said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). I think what they should be focused on is getting the process moving and, frankly, passing the obligation over to the Senate.
Wouldn't it be better if we started working with Russia, than to keep blaming them for everything, Herring tweeted in October. Lift sanctions, no NATO on their borders.
From his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Trump's grip on the GOP has only ever so slightly loosened.
There haven't yet been any public clashes between the candidates, even though Klobuchar's entrance into the race -- and a potential bid by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) -- has crystallized some health-care fault lines, as New York Times's Alexander Burns notes.
Health 202: Why have Democrats focused so much on Medicare-for-all versus Medicaid?
The pandemic has really completely reshaped my life from top to bottom, McCreary said. I don't have $3,500 I can just hand back to the government. I almost wish they had just paid me less to begin with.
His party was so skilled at filibustering President Barack Obama's judicial and political nominations that Democrats eventually ended the minority party's ability to filibuster most of those nominations. (Under McConnell, Republicans got rid of the ability to filibuster Supreme Court nominees, too, which put Justice Neil M. Gorsuch on the court.)
Shulkin, who had served as a top VA official in the Obama administration, initially had the support of Concerned Veterans for America, which was optimistic about his appointment, Caldwell said.
President Biden is lobbying Democrats this week to pass the relief package.
And at a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday: We had a gentleman way into the morning hours go thumbs down. He went thumbs down.
Your father in law, he couldn't afford it, Cruz said.
I asked Davidson afterward if he believed Pence genuinely hadn't realized that the administration's policy involved cuts to Medicaid coverage, or knew and didn't care. Davidson said he assumed Pence's ignorance was feigned, given that the architect behind the block grant proposal had previously worked for Pence in Indiana.
Trump has pressured McConnell to go nuclear — meaning changing Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to win confirmation with a simple majority. But such a move for a Supreme Court nomination would be a drastic, precedent-setting maneuver at odds with McConnell's adherence to Senate tradition.
We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.
Hirono also criticized him for not promising to follow any recommendation of Justice Department ethics officials, who may review whether Barr should recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
Does it have to be fully offset? My personal response is no, he said on ABC.
In recent days, Trump has been looking at pulling together a unit of lawyers outside the White House to guide him as he responds to the ongoing federal probe and to congressional investigations … The outside legal team would be separate from the White House Counsel's Office, which is led by Donald F. McGahn, who served as the Trump campaign's attorney.
Ronny Jackson is one of 15 candidates in a crowded Republican primary in Texas, and the White House hasn't gone out of its way to help, the New York Times reports. Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from Trump's physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct. Now he's running for Congress in Texas' 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple… Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election. … But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Dr. Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate.
I am not going to surrender the responsibilities of the attorney general to get the title, I don't need the title, Barr said.
President Trump billed the new rules as one of several ways to provide consumers with cheaper coverage options than they could find in the Obamacare marketplaces, prompting complaints by Democrats that he was undermining consumer protections laid out in the Affordable Care Act. There's indeed plenty of evidence the administration is trying to weaken the ACA, including the Justice Department's refusal to defend it in court.
Andy Slavitt, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama:
At least 20 diaper banks across the country have provided diapers, feminine and incontinence products, formula and more to federal employees during the shutdown and in the few days since Congress and President Trump agreed to reopen the government, she writes. Diaper banks started to receive calls for help in mid-January, and the entreaties became more and more desperate the longer the shutdown went on, according to organization officials.
I was responding to a false notion that the Republican health care plan will cause people to die in the streets, which I completely reject, Labrador said. In a lengthy exchange with a constituent, I explained to her that Obamacare has failed the vast majority of Americans. In the five-second clip that the media is focusing on, I was trying to explain that all hospitals are required by law to treat patients in need to emergency care regardless of their ability to pay and that the Republican plan does not change that.
--It's still looking extremely difficult for the House to ever pass two bills aimed at stabilizing the Obamacare marketplaces. Several House Republicans told the Washington Examiner this week that they'd have to include more Obamacare reforms in order for members to get behind them. Both measures -- one to authorize cost-sharing reduction payments and the other to fund reinsurance for marketplace insurers -- appear to be stuck in limbo, even though GOP Senate leaders had allegedly promised to move them forward.
TRUMP: He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sean Spicer. Please go ahead, sir.
Trump showed some signs over the weekend of softening his assault on conservatives in Congress. On Sunday morning, he tweeted a more positive message about unity on health care — Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of Obamacare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party! — and later went golfing with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a staunch opponent of the bill who lobbied House conservatives to oppose it.
Schumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative Democrats such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.
Andrew Yang: Thank you. It's a really important question. I went through that tension a little bit earlier in the process. I clearly see why politicians do not seem like normal people, because they are surrounded by organizations whose livelihoods are dependent upon this person's political career. And so they deliver to the candidate, Okay, here are your talking points. Go to them. Do not go beyond these guardrails. And if you do go beyond these guardrails, then people will throw rocks at you for at least a day, and maybe your career will be over, and then all of our careers will be over. So if you're surrounded by that kind of organization and message, then you become very, very guarded pretty quickly. You have your talking points. You deliver them. And Americans can sense it.
The outbreak of bold, fresh thinking and moral fervor on the Democratic left is certainly something to be celebrated. In the liberal mixture of outrage and idealism can be heard the echoes of Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign of 50 years ago, when he memorably declared, Some men see things as they are and ask why. I dream of things that never were, and ask why not.
Trump and Romney meet in New York. Romney describes the meeting on Morning Joe:
The House a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the Hyde Amendment — permanent, but the Senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. The House also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of Trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the Senate is seen as unlikely to pass.
They complain about the slow pace of getting the president's appointments confirmed — but refuse to give up their three-day workweeks and four months of politicking and fundraising.
-- Senate Republican leaders are moving forward with plans to hold a vote next week, even though they still aren't sure they'll have the 50 votes to pass anything. The Wall Street Journal reports: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is intent on keeping pressure on Senate Republicans to move quickly on the bill rolling back and replacing much of the 2010 health law, lawmakers and GOP aides said. The push for a quick vote before the weeklong July 4 recess could backfire, however, as some conservative and centrist Republicans have expressed concern about the emerging shape of the legislation. … Still, Mr. McConnell has reasons to try for a quick health-care vote. The pressure could force lawmakers to reach a consensus on sticking points that have divided them. And GOP leaders in both chambers want to move on to other legislative items.
Reports suggest that Schumer faced conflicting pressures from his party's left and right wings. Progressives wanted to hold out for a DACA fix attached to the funding bill. Red-state Democrats who will face voters in November worry about getting out of step with their constituents. Sen. Claire McCaskill — a moderate Democrat up for reelection in Missouri this year — said of the Democrats' different sides last week, never the twain shall meet.

Internal reports and emails from DHS show that federal law enforcement authorities were warned of potential for violence by groups on Jan. 6. A security bulletin compiled a day before the attack warned that anti-government and racially motivated extremists were likely to participate in the rally near the White House and use the activities as an opportunity to promote their ideologies and motivate followers to promote violence, Shane Harris, Aaron Davis, Nick Miroff and Nate Jones report.
You won't learn this from his ads: When Bloomberg gets tough questions about his past positions, his responses are often misleading.
Since taking office, Trump has largely left untouched Medicare and other programs heavily used by seniors. Republicans have followed his lead, ditching previous proposals to raise the retirement age or impose other restrictions to save costs and reduce the $22 trillion national debt.
He also refused to promise that he would explain to Congress any deletions or changes he made to Mueller's report before it was released.
They seem to have developed amnesia about the many occasions on which they have used the same procedures to pass tax cuts, starting with the budget that allowed President Ronald Reagan to make his in 1981 and continuing through Donald Trump's in 2017. That same year, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also employed reconciliation rules in his unsuccessful attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act; it failed because three Republicans joined Democrats to defeat it.
Barr told Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) that if Trump tried to fire a prosecutor to end an investigation — such as a case in the Southern District of New York that appears to implicate him — he would resign.
KELLY: Most recently, on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war.
The reality: While the individual mandate was an important incentive for Americans to seek health insurance, it was only one part of a far-reaching law that remains intact. The repeal does not take effect until 2019, and enrollment in Obamacare has remained strong. The Congressional Budget Office says the marketplaces are expected to remain stable for years.
In January 2020, I became a mother. By May, I was preparing to return to my job as a public radio host and work from a coat closet while a babysitter cared for my 4-month-old in the next room. It was a hacked work-from-home setup mirrored by countless other women across the country who were lucky enough to be able to afford child care. As a single parent, I rarely get a break from work or mothering, but I was at least able to afford hiring a sitter. And that's something many other working mothers around the country have struggled to do.
Here's what I'd like to see happen. The Supreme Court ruled, I don't agree with the ruling. I'm of favor of marriage between -- you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman. What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.
Barr sought to assuage Grassley's concerns, reminding him that in his former stint as attorney general, we were able to establish very cooperative and productive relationships with all the members, and assuring him that that will be the same approach I will bring to the job if reconfirmed.
But by resurfacing old battles about stripping away popular elements of the current health-care system, Trump is likely to embolden and unite Democrats who seek to make health care a top issue in 2020, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. Democrats who have been divided in recent months over proposed Medicare-for-all legislation can now coalesce around the idea of protecting the ACA's most popular provisions, she said.
He would have gotten it earlier, if he could have afforded it earlier, but because of government regulations, he couldn't, Cruz said.
The Labor Department this month proposed looser regulations on so-called association health plans, under which small businesses, professional associations and others in similar circumstances can band together and buy insurance coverage for their groups as though they were large employers. The department argues that up to 11 million people working at small businesses or as sole proprietors lack health insurance, and that the new rules would help provide them more options.
The cost growth has been particularly marked among employer-sponsored plans, which cover about half of all Americans.
Pence's name is synonymous with religious freedom bills. Conservatives have questioned Trump's support for the legislation.
Obamacare generally requires insurers to charge all their customers comparable prices, with rates varying only by their ages, where they live and whether they smoke. Under the Republican proposal, states could get exemptions from those rules by requesting a federal wavier.
Under Justice Department rules, Kennedy asked, What happens next?
Her big project was The Bedwetter, a musical adaptation of her best-selling 2010 memoir. It was set to open off-Broadway in May at the Atlantic Theater Company with a cast that included Linda Lavin and Stephanie J. Block.
In May 1997, ten years before Purdue would plead guilty to minimizing the addictive quality of OxyContin, the company's head of sales and marketing, Michael Friedman, sent an email to Sackler explaining he didn't want to correct an incorrect impression that Oxycontin was weaker than morphine, reports ProPublica's David Armstrong in this latest story co-published with Stat News.
Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's White House chief strategist, who helped him craft the speech, said it was designed with Jackson in mind.
Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility on Wall Street. Stock drops and America goes up, he said. I don't care. I want to do it right or not at all. He added that drug companies should produce more products in the United States.
But few GOP senators so far have endorsed the president's proposed tax cuts. That GOP division gave Democrats more leverage over Congress' response. McConnell acknowledged as much when he gave ball control to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hammer out a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
OOF: The doctor who sounded the alarm on the coronavirus died of the illness on Thursday, The Post's Simon Denyer and Adam Taylor report. Li Wenliang was previously detained by authorities when he noticed people were becoming infected and told other medical professionals in a group chat.
—As part of its effort to tackle the opioid epidemic, the Justice Department has requested to join settlement talks in federal court involving hundreds of lawsuits against drug manufacturers and distributors. The government requested to join as a friend of the court in a filing Monday before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Reuters reports. We are determined to see that justice is done in this case and that ultimately we end this nation's unprecedented drug crisis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.
Two conservative leaders also indicated their respective groups won't go for funding the CSR subsidies, which help insurers discount things like co-payments for the lowest-income marketplace enrollees. The CSRs] are still something that most of the guys I am talking with are saying I can't get there, said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the 170-member Republican Study Committee. I don't know that there is a whole lot of support for it here, said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
I'll tell you I told Secretary Azar that all of us in government, including [President] Trump, need to get something done, Cummings said, referring to a recent meeting between him and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

But little has been done to advance virtual health in Medicare, partly because of the CBO's stance. The Center for Telehealth and eHealth Law is working with Mercer University in Georgia to compile evidence that telehealth either saves money or is at least cost-neutral. The center's deputy executive director, Christa Natoli, said the goal is to have a report ready to give the CBO sometime next year.
Eric Columbus, a former senior counsel to the deputy attorney general at DOJ, wrote a helpful primer about the special counsel regulations in January: The regulations don't say what format that report must take or what happens next. If Mueller believes he has information that could warrant impeachment, he could weave it into a narrative like the Starr Report. But even if Rosenstein wanted to make the report public, he would be limited by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which imposes strict limits on the disclosure of grand jury materials. This rule, which has the force of law, is intended to preserve the integrity of grand jury investigations and encourage witnesses to testify fully and frankly.
Presidential kids live in a universe of their own, out of the limelight but rarely hidden, often coming of age in an unforgiving fishbowl that highlighted their every misstep.
Otherwise, he sits and watches. He rests his chin in his hand. He stares straight ahead. He sits back and interlocks his fingers. He plays with his pen. He takes his reading glasses off and puts them on again. He starts to write something, then puts his pen back down. He roots around in his briefcase for something — anything? — to occupy him.
The day before, Reid had attacked the integrity of Republicans, including the majority whip, John Cornyn, suggesting they were doing the bidding of the billionaire Koch brothers.
The comment was met with immediate condemnation from fiscally conservative groups such as the Club for Growth, which led the successful effort to ban earmarks — local projects inserted by members into spending bills — in 2011. At the time, both President Barack Obama and the tea party agreed that the practice had become corrupt and had to be halted. The temporary ban has yet to be lifted.
While Republicans have praised him, Democrats have been skeptical. Some say they intend to force a procedure requiring him to reach a 60-vote threshold before he can get an up-or-down vote.
It will increase premiums for seniors, but do nothing to force drug manufacturers to lower prices,'' said CVS Health in its comment letter. The company, which is the umbrella organization that includes pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark, said it may not be realistic for rebates to be removed by 2020 or even 2022.
The CBO's estimate is mostly the result of an analysis of the impact of the law on the supply of labor. That means how many people choose to participate in the workforce, we wrote. If someone says they decided to leave their job for personal reasons, most people would not say they 'lost' their jobs. They simply decided not to work.
In that process, a parliamentarian held Republicans up by ruling that one of the central pieces of their bill, eliminating the individual mandate that people have health insurance or else pay a tax, wasn't directly related to the budget and couldn't be passed under reconciliation.
Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.
Along their journey down the street, the senators chided the secretive, behind-closed-doors tactics used by Republicans in crafting the bill.
4. It has approved plans that fall short of ACA coverage requirements: In chipping away at Obamacare, the Trump administration seems to have a driving principle, said Rivlin: to give people access to cheaper health plans that cover less.
-- But even if a merger of the Labor and Education departments were to take place, experts doubt it would accomplish its intended goals. From Danielle Douglas-Gabriel: Many said they see the value in more closely aligning workforce development and career education, especially sharing the expertise of staff at the agencies. But some said they doubt the administration could effectively pull off the consolidation, and they question the motives. … [S]ome conservatives [also] don't believe the Trump administration could execute the proposed merger … in a way that would save money and make the agencies more efficient.

The emails are included in portions of the lawsuit, filed Thursday, that were publicly redacted but were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Sara and Jared write. The filing brings sweeping civil claims against Purdue, eight members of its controlling Sackler family, and several other drugmakers and distributors, seeking to hold them accountable for opioid addiction in New York.
Over the next three months, insurers who sell plans on Healthcare.gov and a dozen state-run marketplaces will be finalizing their rates and plan offerings for 2020. They've weathered plenty of uncertainty before – most notably when Republicans tried to repeal the ACA two years ago – but Trump's renewed attacks on the ACA this week feed into what insurers hate the most: Uncertainty about who will be buying their plans and what those plans will need to cover.
Although the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were developed using lab testing on cell lines derived from an aborted fetus, they do not use these lines in the manufacturing process, making the connection to abortion … extremely remote, according to the diocese.

Whether they like it or not, the dominant story of the week for House Democrats was Sunday night tweets by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) about Israel's influence in American politics. On Monday, Omar and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released statements saying that the freshman Democrat would work to combat anti-Semitism. On Wednesday, Republicans got every Democrat to vote to condemn anti-Semitism, putting the language in a historic resolution to cut off American support for Saudi military operations in Yemen.
Wiesman, who will testify today before the Senate HELP Committee, lamented a lack of strategy. He wants the federal government to provide funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch a campaign to examine why people are worried about vaccine safety and come up with a public health response, Lena reports.
Kicker: We've got 31 Democrats who serve in districts that Donald Trump won, and I'm one of them, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) said. When I go home, I don't have people asking me about impeaching him. That is just not something that I hear. They consistently ask about health care and rebuilding our country and figuring out how to work together.
Time and time again, Price invoked the pledge he has made repeatedly to lawmakers since President Trump selected him for his post. What we're committed to is making sure the American people have access to affordable coverage, he told Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies.
But at the end of the day, the ACA is still a law guiding insurance marketplaces and people's health insurance decisions. The exchanges it set up for insurance companies to sell insurance directly to consumers are still running. Medicaid expansion — the largest aspect of Obamacare — continues to give millions of people insurance.
I don't like being alarmist. But I'm alarmed.

Hopefully it will have some immediate impact, Gottlieb said.
The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted yesterday.
In other words, there is no real saving — some portion of the cost of providing free medical care to the poor is merely shifted from all federal taxpayers to state taxpayers, and higher premiums for everyone else. Zero-sum game.
First came the tariffs that hit rural America hard. In the run-up to the midterms, we heard this kind of report: The rust belt states he won over, in some cases very narrowly, are losing faith . . . [A]cross five of the rust belt states won by Trump in 2016 more voters believe the president's tariffs on foreign imports are harmful to their families than beneficial.

For McConnell, seeing Trump as a helpful partner in enacting a conservative agenda may be the only alternative. Yet it's also an unproven position, given the enormous uncertainty that remains about how much the GOP can actually get done with Trump in charge.
On Fox News, Ken Starr compared the ways the media covered his investigation and the Mueller probe:
BAIER: Mr. Trump, you've repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you'll ask the best people when you become president, and take their advice.
-- A core argument from Democrats yesterday was that the framers didn't believe a president needed to break the law in order to warrant impeachment. The Constitution is not a suicide pact, said Nadler, one of the managers. It does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.
Do you think we're bad for America? You think I'm bad for America? Hannity asked.
It is difficult to tell how many people could pay more if the Republican bill becomes law. If states did not try to waive the rules, patients would continue to have some protections.
The language waives a prohibition in the Social Security Act, which bars federal payments to be made with respect to any amount expended for roads, bridges, stadiums, or any other item or service not covered under a State plan under this title. Congress has sought on several occasions to bar these kinds of transfers, which Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) described in a 2008 hearing as a scam.
March for Life President Jeanne Mancini told Julie the march strives for political balance but finds it increasingly difficult to persuade Democrats to speak to attendees.

The only health care price [Trump] has dropped is his former secretary, said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), during her opening statement, referring to former HHS secretary Tom Price who resigned after it was revealed he traveled on pricey private jets instead of commercial airplanes.
Humanizing the consequences: The Post ran a lengthy feature on Sunday's front page from a health clinic in McDowell County, West Virginia, which Trump carried with 74 percent and which has the shortest life expectancy of any county in the nation. Many supporters of the president who are now able to see a doctor there because of the Medicaid expansion simply wouldn't be able to afford the care they now receive under the House plan. (Jessica Contrera has more.)
McCarthy's remarks about the Freedom Caucus threaten to renew an old rift between the top House Republican and the Freedom Caucus — one that dates to 2015, when the group blocked McCarthy from succeeding John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) as House speaker. McCarthy has since moved aggressively to win over conservatives by pursuing a harder line on immigration, spending and other key policy issues.
3. Will Congress delay Obamacare taxes on health insurers and medical device manufacturers?
But at the very moment he was called upon to teach the American people of the value of their republican Constitution, Chief Justice Roberts asserted the judicial restraint of the democratic constitution and turned them away. And that, my friends, was the end of our constitutional moment. That was the beginning of the end of constitutional conservatism as a political movement. And it kindled the resentment and populism that led to Donald Trump….
The move by Murphy is the latest step in his attempt to shore up the Affordable Care Act, a President Barack Obama-era law that has been under fire from President Donald Trump, Michael writes. For example: New Jersey reinstated the individual mandate, requiring most residents have insurance or pay a penalty. It began a reinsurance program to help insurers pay for the highest-risk patients. And it prevents insurers from selling less expensive, but also less comprehensive, policies.
It was a thoroughly uncontroversial remark for a modern conservative politician to make — the kind that makes it easy to forget how unpopular King was when he was alive. Gallup polling estimated that Americans felt more negatively toward him as the 1960s progressed. Critics branded King a radical communist hellbent on destroying America, and those accusations continued well after he was killed; President Ronald Reagan initially opposed the proposal to make King's birthday a national holiday, and more than 100 lawmakers in the House and Senate voted against it. In a 1983 debate on the matter, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) accused King of harboring radical political views rooted in Marxist communism.
Remember: Biden did not support Medicare-for-all during the campaign, instead opting to embrace changes to Obamacare like adding a public option.
When the current CR expires in February, lawmakers could repeat the process. But lawmakers could lose patience with short-term fixes. And Congress still has to decide overall levels of defense and domestic spending. If it doesn't, it would face a sequester — a compromise Congress bound itself to seven years ago — that automatically triggers across-the-board cuts to spending in both areas. Both GOP defense hawks and Democrats passionate about domestic programs seem eager to avoid that.
Barr said he was very concerned by the rise of federal district courts issuing nationwide injunctions to hold back various policies of President Trump's, such as Monday's ruling by a Pennsylvania judge that stopped a rule change that would have made it harder for some to access birth control.

OAN breaks its cycle of half-hour newscasts only for two hours of evening opinion shows — The Daily Ledger with Graham Ledger and Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler — both of which are guns-blazing nightly tributes to Trump. Ledger is a tough guy who takes no prisoners. Talking about people coming into the country from majority-Muslim countries, he says, If they won't take a bite out of a pulled pork sandwich, we probably won't let them in the country. Wheeler leans more on clever snark and verbal eyerolls: How many innocent people have Islamophobes killed this week? Yeah, that's what I thought.

It began with the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, engineered by Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, leaders of the party's conservative wing. In what became known as the K Street Project, DeLay, the new majority leader, assured business lobbyists that their interests would be protected and their access guaranteed — but only if they demonstrated loyalty to the Republican agenda.

The FDA, for example, typically conducts about 160 routine food inspections a week in the United States, with about a third involving high-risk processing facilities, Laurie and Joel report, adding Gottlieb said legal guidance from the 2013 shutdown said the agency couldn't do regular food inspections during a funding shortfall. But after canceling more than 50 high-risk inspections, he said he has obtained new guidance that he believes will allow him to call back about 150 furloughed inspectors to focus on high-risk facilities.

Anton Troianovski reports: Nazarbayev has ruled Kazakhstan, Central Asia's largest country, since it became an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Senate Chairman Kassym-Jomart Tokayev will take over as president until the next election, currently scheduled for 2020.
Usually, when an official of Gottlieb's stature resigns in Washington or Wall Street, 'spending more time with my family' is rarely the real reason, Angelica writes. And his unexpected departure, just two months after denying plans to step down, fanned speculation that he was at odds with the Trump administration and forced out like so many other top officials over the last two years.
The deliberations on Medicaid expansion are further along than other components of the law­makers' thinking about how to shift government health policies in a more conservative direction, according to these individuals. The basic outline emerging from the Energy and Commerce Committee would grandfather in the adults currently on Medicaid-­ expansion rolls in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Still to be decided is whether the extra dollars for their coverage would last a specific length of time or continue as long as a beneficiary remained eligible.
And even if current regulations don't carry over, the universe of people affected by this change likely is not the full 7 million. There already are people within that 7 million population who don't qualify for the tax credit because they have another form of insurance.
Now, having saved the Constitution from legal activists, he is called to work with the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to resurrect the shuttered U.S. economy. This must be done, he told me this week, without allowing Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to use the crisis to remake America. McConnell seeks commitment to recovery-only measures and a truce to the great partisan shootout. Goodness, he told me. I wish we could all just turn this off, you know, until we get to a period where we've bent the curve and are beginning to get back to normal. I don't expect that's going to happen, however.
Why should you put your race in it? she said.
Warren emphasizes her gender – and the possibly historic nature of her campaign to be the first female president – far more than Klobuchar does in her stump speech. After Warren spoke last night, before she gaggled with reporters, she posed for pictures with a line of young people. She leaned down to all the little girls and repeated the same message over a dozen times: Hi, my name is Elizabeth, and I'm running for president, because that's what girls do. Then she reached out her pinkie and made pinkie promises with each little girl.
What Operation Warp Speed has generally done is said, 'We're responsible for getting the drugs to the states, and after that, it's their problem,'  Frieden said. That's a way to facilitate finger pointing; that's neither a plan nor a solution.
Details on what candidates would do about border crisis are still light: All the Democratic candidates, on the trail, have decried Trump's policy of separating children at the border. But most have been far less specific on what they'd do to solve the influx of immigrants coming into the United States. That didn't change much Thursday night.
But regardless of who funds drug development, we also need to raise the standards for evaluating and approving drugs, which neither this administration nor its predecessors have shown an interest in doing. In recent years, expedited drug development pathways and downgraded standards of evidence have left us in the dark about how well many new drugs work — or even if they really work at all. Rushing new drugs to market based on shoddy research serves the industry, not patients. A study of recently approved cancer drugs in JAMA Internal Medicine found a majority of these drugs won approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints, like imaging findings, that frequently don't translate into better health. Disturbingly, on follow-up, more than half of the drugs were never shown to improve survival.
Trump also suggests that relief money has been misspent, a point echoed by spokesman Hogan Gidley on MSNBC: He gave them a lot of money. They mismanaged and misused that money. It hurts their people. That is what he is upset about. Gidley did not respond to a request for an explanation, but in another part of the interview, he referred to food rotting in the ports.
OOF: Drug manufacturers began 2018 by hiking the prices of dozens of medications -- but the costs have generally not risen beyond 10 percent because of a self-imposed industry cap, Reuters reports. For example, while Allergan Inc. hiked prices on 18 different drugs, the company's chief executive Brent Saunders vowed in 2016 to limit price increases to 10 percent as part of a Social Contract with Patients.
It was sort of like we paid the same amount of money and had no choice, Smith said. What is the point of even having insurance absent a catastrophic thing?
— An Alabama judge is allowing a man whose girlfriend got an abortion at six weeks of pregnancy to sue the clinic that gave her a pill and its manufacturer on behalf of the aborted fetus, our Post colleagues Ariana Eunjung Cha and Emily Wax Thibodeaux report. The decision centers on the state's personhood law that recognizes the legal rights of the unborn.
General costs, however, typically rise more slowly than medical costs. After 2025, the increases to Medicaid would no longer be able to keep pace, with the gap growing each year. After a decade or two, that discrepancy would add up to of hundreds of billions of dollars.
* UNDECIDED VOTERS VARY FROM STATE TO STATE: Nate Silver breaks down the polling and concludes that the number of remaining voters varies, depending on the state, which could matter in the final two weeks:
It'd be a remarkable change of pace, given that Cruz is no stranger to earning Congress's ire -- from both sides of the aisle. And often, he has done it for no other reason than to make a political point -- coming across as petty and ambitious to his colleagues in the process.
But all those people lost to the candidate who doesn't.
Then the prosecutor comes in and says, 'We're going to look into your mind and see what your intent was in performing these two lawful acts,'  Barr said. It's too much power to the prosecutor.
It's boring old management stuff, said Walton, saying that excessive bureaucracy prevented papers from getting approved rapidly and scholars from getting permission to attend meetings. We think we can make it leaner and more effective.
The reverse was true in last year's midterm elections, as Democrats effectively used the GOP desire to eliminate the law — and its protections for people with preexisting medical conditions — to defeat Republicans. Democrats flipped at least 40 seats en route to capturing the House majority.

People thought he was very reform-minded. We were on very friendly terms, Selnick said.
Are there enough people like her — the folks Buttigieg calls future former Republicans — to propel him to a victory on Feb. 3? Unlikely. But Iowa's quirky process is known for surprises, and this year the outcome seems especially hard to predict.
The Sanders gang might argue that Biden needs the Sanders people to win in November. Perhaps. Actually Biden already is well-situated to win the vast majority of Democrats as well as independents and a bunch of alienated Republicans. He has become more popular with each passing week among Democrats and, as President Trump bungles the U.S. response to the coronavirus, could be the overwhelming favorite to win in November.
The president has at his fingertips tens of billions of dollars in intelligence apparatus, said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, in a Monday interview with CBS News. I think he might have something there, but if not, we're going to find out.
This is hardly the first time that McCain has frustrated his own party. The longtime senator, former Republican presidential nominee and former prisoner of war has long been known as a maverick. He was strongly criticized in 2017 when he and two other Republicans voted against the Obamacare repeal, saving the law by one vote.

The lawsuits seek a court injunction to halt the implementation of the rule in 60 days, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports, and they're the first in an expected wave of legal challenges to the administration's changes to the Title X family-planning program.
Chairman Grassley and Sen. Wyden have an incredible bipartisan package to get drug prices down and lower what seniors pay out of pocket for their drugs, he said in an interview with an Iowa radio station. I have worked closely with them — we've got to get that package to the Senate floor. We've got to get that passed out of Congress.
We think exactly alike. I say quietly to myself, all the time actually, there must be some reason I'm a billionaire.
Moreover, Bloomberg should start now. (Recall how the Obama campaign saturated swing states with anti-Mitt Romney ads in the summer of 2012 before Romney had the money to go on the air.) It is time to fix in voters' minds that Trump is not only morally reprehensible but also so unfit as to pose a threat to their safety and security.
Now, if he didn't say that, he has an easy solution. Simply release the tape.
In addition, on the global front, the administration is proposing cuts to global AIDS programs. The administration is proposing cuts to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and also to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a multibillion-dollar program started by President George W. Bush. This is the administration's third budget request to reduce global funding. Congress has rejected the cuts each previous year.
Sixteen miles away in Exeter, a few hours earlier, Klobuchar spoke to 350 people with another 200 watching a feed in an overflow room. As you've probably heard, we're on a bit of a surge, she said. The Minnesotan is drawing consistently bigger crowds over the last few days than she got before her fifth-place finish in Iowa, and her campaign says she's raised more than $3 million since her strong debate performance on Friday night.
The suit also comes as a growing number of cultural institutions in the U.S. and around the world have said they would stop accepting donations from the family that has donated to museums for decades, as our colleague Peggy McGlone has reported. This week, after facing rejection from three major museums, the Sackler family's philanthropic trust said it would halt donations.

Thank you for jumping on the call. Look forward to talking with you later when we're in the single digits headed towards inauguration.
And Politico reports this has endeared Trump to Bannon. If it portrays Trump as a man of action, who cares if it's also an epic moral, substantive and political disaster that's causing global turmoil?
So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.
Republicans chose the 25 percent rate because they believe other savings in the tax code would make up for the difference and help businesses remain competitive, according to a senior GOP aide.
NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:
The court's role as a force for inequality started a few years before the Powell memo — in 1969, when Nixon became president. Nixon shared the business community's skepticism toward the Warren court, and he campaigned on a promise to change it. That court had spent the past 15 years promoting civil rights, starting with Brown v. Board of Education, and expanding the rights of poor Americans, with rulings like Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, a 1966 decision striking down poll taxes. In Nixon's first three years in office, he appointed four justices, one of the fastest rates of turnover in history. The new members — Warren Burger (the new chief justice), Harry Blackmun, William Rehnquist and Powell — were more sympathetic to big business than their predecessors.
The department is looking at options for 2018 in those counties where there currently isn't an insurer planning to sell on the federal exchange, Brock said. We'll be working to identify coverage options for consumers, but that process will take some time.
We also tested partisan differences but found no clear asymmetries between Democrats and Republicans.

But the most ambitious thing the Biden-Harris administration could do is to create a national child-care system that engages the business community as well as federal, state and local governments. All parents should have access to high-quality, affordable (dare I say free?) child care. We should no longer have a society where some mothers can afford live-in au pairs, while others scrounge for help at the risk of losing their jobs. Whether they are risking their health and safety on the front lines of the pandemic or Zooming from home, working mothers have given everything they have this year to their jobs. The Biden-Harris administration owes it to them to see their children are well taken care of. Tanzina Vega is host of the nationally syndicated public radio show The Takeaway from WNYC and PRX.

Democratic opposition and complex Senate rules mean that core pieces of the 2010 health-care overhaul are likely to remain, including the legal framework for the individual mandate and pieces of the state exchanges the law created. Furthermore, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to preserve other key aspects, such as a ban on insurers denying coverage because of preexisting conditions and a requirement that insurers cover children under 26 on their parents' plans.
I have always stated that one of the few good things about Obamacare is that people with preexisting conditions would be covered, Long said in a statement. The MacArthur amendment strips away any guarantee that preexisting conditions would be covered and affordable.
Lock her up. Instruct the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. Trump had said the investigation would include Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and the ways in which the Clinton Foundation raised money. (Trump never got this done, although at times he reportedly pushed for such a step.)
Scott Green, a plastic surgeon, was wearing scrubs, gloves and a surgical cap when he called into a court hearing to contest a traffic violation, The Post's Katie Shepherd reports. As they waited for the judge to arrive for a hearing that was live-streamed on YouTube under state laws, Green could be seen handling surgical tools. At one point, an apparently unconscious patient on a table briefly appeared in the frame, she writes.
The political trouble with Texas v. United States, the lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general last year, is simple. Their argument, which many outside observers consider specious, is that Congress killed the ACA when it passed the 2017 tax-cut law. A late addition to that law reduced to zero the ACA's penalty for people who don't buy insurance. In 2012, the Supreme Court had upheld most of the ACA by ruling that the penalty was a tax and therefore constitutional. Therefore, if this case could be kicked up to the court again, the current justices might rule that the whole law would have to fall.
Ryan, who launched his campaign April 4, said the epidemic of opioid addiction in the Midwest has made immigration a pressing issue for many in the region, given the flow of heroin and fentanyl from Mexico.
The crowd, however enthusiastic, was visibly smaller than the turnout for Obama's inauguration in 2009, when Washington was infused with a sense of hope.
Distilling each of these into a mere response to a single vote is an oversimplification. In each of these instances, these GOP senators at times found themselves being critical of Trump and his behavior as president. Romney's vote, for instance, was the culmination of many comments that were critical of Trump's actions vis-a-vis Ukraine. Romney was also perhaps the most vocal GOP establishment critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign, delivering an indictment of Trump and his moral character in a March 2016 speech. As you can see in the chart above, even back then, his approval ratings among Republicans and Democrats were somewhat similar.
Thus, the chyron solved a problem the networks created in the first place, said Jane Hall, a journalism professor at American University.

The scrutiny by the House's new Democratic majority won't necessarily stop bungling and impropriety, but now such behavior will no longer happen in darkness. On Thursday, the House held a subcommittee hearing that revealed that Trump administration officials were warned that separating migrant families would be traumatic and probably illegal. Also Thursday, a Ways and Means Committee panel probed ways to release Trump's tax returns. Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen will meet with the House Intelligence Committee soon.
Shalala: We would very much like to make some improvements in the ACA. I was always worried the subsidies weren't deep enough. Because you're basically capturing a group of people who had lousy health insurance or didn't have any health insurance, who don't get big increases in their pay. I've always felt that we have to go deeper into the middle class with subsidies.
Three administration officials told The Post that the Biden administration is reviewing options to eliminate the waiver.
The $100-billion-plus Families First coronavirus response package Trump signed last week dramatically expands paid sick leave and family medical leave for tens of millions of workers, provisions aimed at blunting the economic impact of the pandemic.

According to the report, the most common reason the Department of Homeland Security gave health officials for the 118 most recent separations was that parents had a criminal history, Amy writes. But information on the parents' criminal records often was so sketchy, the report said, that it is unclear whether the separations were warranted or whether the children could be safely returned to their parents.
The Medicare actuary believes the impact of the individual-mandate repeal is even less: The elimination of the individual mandate in 2019 is assumed to result in a small enrollment decrease, primarily concentrated in 2019 — about 2.5 million — eventually rising to an increase of 4 million in the uninsured population by 2021.
An alumna of George W. Bush's White House and State Department reacted to the latest revelation by CNN of a birther in a senior Pentagon job:
The Health 202 wrote last week that the Washington Democrat is planning to release a sweeping Medicare-for-all plan around the end of the month and is looking for more support from her party for the plan.
-- In his announcement, McConnell said he has the votes to begin the trial in the format that he and most of his members have long envisioned: opening arguments for both the House impeachment managers and Trump's defense team, as well as time for senators to submit questions in writing. Seung Min Kim, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: Under the majority leader's plan, a decision on whether to call witnesses would be made once that first phase of the trial is over — a move announced Tuesday to put the pressure back on Pelosi amid simmering frustration from GOP senators over the speaker's delay in sending the articles. That echoes the format of President [Bill] Clinton's trial 21 years ago, and McConnell has been able to persuade his members that Trump should be treated in the same fashion as Clinton.
He feels just as strongly about Kelly's pleas for party unity, calling them the height of dishonesty when what we are trying to draw attention to is the presence, perhaps significant presence, of people who will not and cannot unify in November.
As she began her questioning of Barr, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a potential 2020 presidential contender, asked him point blank about his views about the Trump campaign promise and border security proposal that has brought the government to a halt.
HHS confirmed the policy change late Wednesday.
Trump is older than all previous presidents when they first took office, Jenna writes. He is also the heaviest president in at least a generation and consumes a diet heavy with Big Macs, Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, fried chicken, pizza, well-done steak and two rounds of dessert. He seems to get little exercise beyond swinging a golf club, as he spends most of his time on the course traveling in an electric cart. And he likes to brag about how little sleep he gets.
They also protested yesterday as the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general. Barr has said little recently about abortion rights, but advocates have pointed to comments he made in the early 1990s that the Roe v. Wade case that established the right to an abortion will ultimately be overturned.
As Republicans have struggled to find a health-care bill on which they can reach a consensus, Ryan agreed to support an amendment that would allow insurance providers in some states to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions or costly health problems, as long as that state set up high-risk pools that could help cover the cost of care.
But in North Carolina, Democratic governor Roy Cooper — whose efforts to expand Medicaid have been tied up by Republican legislators — and Democrats are vowing to make the issue central in the 2020 statewide and legislative elections. If that produces more victories, that could portend another big breakthrough.
Democrats have also included expensive measures that are barely related to pandemic relief. The bill increases federal subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare, for example, and eliminates the income limit needed to qualify for them. It's one thing to subsidize health insurance coverage for people who have been unemployed for a long time as a result of the pandemic; it's quite another to simply expand subsidies for everyone. The bill also increases the earned-income tax credit and child tax credits. Neither measure is tied to need as a result of the pandemic, nor are they necessary in light of the massive amounts of aid previously provided.
CBO forecasts do not always look great in the rearview mirror. The agency was certainly hamstrung at the start by the GOP's demand that the CBO first estimate the health-care repeal with an old baseline. Ironically, that helped make the impact of the GOP plan look even worse. Over time, with more data about how Americans reacted to the individual mandate and fresher baselines, the CBO became more conservative in estimating its impact.
President Trump and his allies are waging their most aggressive effort yet to help Senate GOP leaders pass an expansive health-care bill next week, but the endeavor encountered new resistance Friday when a fifth Republican senator said he does not support the bill as is.
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty -- and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed Right to Try, he said.
We know that competition does not thrive in countries where leaders threaten criminal prosecution of political opponents and fire diplomats and civil servants who expose their corruption. Nor do markets flourish in countries where tariff waivers are handed out to political allies, government contracts are withheld from political critics, government regulations are not enforced against campaign contributors, and companies are subject to antitrust investigations for lobbying against government policies.
If I were you, I'd answer his letters, Graham piped in, inspiring laughter that cut the tension in the room.
-- Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) resigned from the House Freedom Caucus on Sunday, citing the group's opposition to the health care bill. In order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the American people for eight years, we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward, Poe said in a statement. Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do. His remarks come just hours after Trump tweeted that Freedom Caucus have helped save Planned Parenthood and Obamacare by opposing the bill. (Amber Phillips)

Part of what led to the firing of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was reportedly tension between her and the president over Trump's support for reinstating the administration's family separation policy. NBC News's Julia Ainsley and Geoff Bennet report Trump for months has been pushing his administration to revive the separation of families at the U.S. border with Mexico. They add an administration official said Trump believes the policy was effective in curbing asylum-seekers.
Sanders was the clear favorite among Iowa caucuses-goers who prefer a single-payer health-care system. But Buttigieg nabbed the largest share of voters who are leery of replacing all private plans with government coverage.

The assurances came after lawmakers across the GOP's ideological divides sounded anxious notes this week about advancing legislation that would repeal Obamacare without firm plans for its replacement.
Following the vote, the committee's top Republicans Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Michael Burgess (R-Tex.) released a statement saying the six bipartisan bills will help reduce drug prices by bringing more generic competition to market. This will make a real difference for many Americans and this just goes to show that when we work together, we can achieve real results.
After an awkward silence, Grassley told him: I guess not, Mr. President.
Barr called it ludicrous that his public comments critical of the Mueller investigation were a way of publicly auditioning for the attorney general job, and he promised that no changes will be made to the special counsel's report before its public release.
Derangement as an affliction of the politically engaged presented in a gruesome new way on Jan. 6, when hordes of Trump supporters, espousing false claims that their man had won the election, laid siege to the Capitol, brutalizing police officers, hunting for lawmakers and defacing their offices. Some of the rioters supported QAnon, a sprawling set of outlandish disinformation — for example, that Trump's political opponents are sickos who abuse children and eat babies — that has coalesced into an extremist ideology and radicalized its adherents. (The FBI has designated QAnon a domestic terrorism threat.)
Chyrons became a way to arrest viewers' attention as they surfed through hundreds of channels, he said.

We make up 15 percent of the problem, Biden said, which meant that the rest of the world represents 85 percent. We have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world to make more ambitious changes, he said.

In sum, it's folly to make predictions in the age of Trump. But if Democrats want to be free of McConnell, their most effective foe, they have a lot of work to do.
In 1992, when I was attorney general, the violent crime rates were the worst in American history, the sentences were extremely short, Barr said, noting average sentences for rape were three years, and murder, just five to seven.

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended following vaccinations of health-care workers and nursing home residents with shots for people over 75 and essential workers, Florida, along with Texas, Oklahoma and Hawaii, moved to vaccinate people 65 and older before essential workers. But as states seek to distribute a limited supply of vaccines to a broad swath of people, often with little federal support, the rollout has at time seemed chaotic.
Mexico deported 436,125 individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras between January 2015 and September 2018, according to the Mexican newspaper El Universal.

When the CDC or NIH or any of the medical groups come out and say women don't have to have a pap test every other day – that they need to come every two years or whatever the guidance is – Planned Parenthood is often the very first large-scale women's reproductive care provider to implement those things, Laguens said.
Of the 2.1 million federal workers nationwide, The Post reported, approximately 800,000 are expected to be affected by the shutdown.
Barr added, We really need to get some energy behind it and get it done.
It will be challenging for Trump and Republicans to win the argument against these two differing objections simultaneously — if anything, they are losing the argument on both fronts. It turns out that merely chanting the phrases Obamacare is a disaster and the Republican plan would lower costs through more choice and freedom might not be enough to win the debate, now that it's focusing so hard on policy specifics.
They'll testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce's Oversight subcommittee, its chairwoman Diana DeGette (D-Co.) announced yesterday, in an initial hearing about insulin prices. They've also been targeted by Grassley and Wyden, who kicked off their own insulin investigation with letters demanding an explanation for insulin prices hikes by as much as 500 percent.

McConnell told Politico that his focus in the coming months will be stopping efforts by some Democrats to pass a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health-care plan, which he derided as a Medicare-for-none scheme.
That's how many fewer people would be insured under Republicans' health-care plan than are insured by Obamacare now, according to the CBO's new estimate.
Cut tax rates on investment income. Investment income is currently taxed at a top rate of 20 percent — lower than the top rate for ordinary income. The GOP plan would further reduce that rate by allowing taxpayers to deduct 50 percent of their net capital gains, dividends and interest income. That would create a new rate structure of 6 percent, 12.5 percent and 16.5 percent.

Still, the book is a revelation. It showcases the range of Krugman's intellect — he can toggle authoritatively from climate change and the Green New Deal to the Maastricht Treaty and currency crises — and his gift for clear, accessible writing.

According to a 2016 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, approximately 52 million Americans under the age of 65 could find their access to health insurance at risk because of a wide range of preexisting conditions, from diabetes to cancer to pregnancy. Health insurers have for years been raising premiums, complaining about uncertainty and withdrawing from the business of selling individual insurance plans, and more changes could further destabilize the market.
We have endorsed Ms. Clinton for president, contending that she is well qualified, well prepared and likely to do a good job. But to voters who disagree — who have never voted for a Democrat, say, or who question our assessment of her qualifications — we would argue that Mr. Trump's challenge to the very core of our democracy nonetheless provides strong reason to vote for her.
So the Republican health-care plan is, essentially, you're on your own. They want to claw back the expansion of Medicaid — sorry, working poor, you're on your own. They want to remove the Affordable Care Act's subsidies for middle-income people and replace them with some meager tax credits. If that isn't enough to allow you to afford coverage, you're on your own. That's also the principle behind the privatization of Medicare that Ryan has long advocated: He wants to replace Medicare's guaranteed coverage for seniors with a voucher that might or might not pay for private coverage. If it doesn't, you're on your own. Sure, millions of people will lose coverage if they repeal the ACA, but that's less important than whether we're all enjoying more freedom.
So does Trump have a point? Is the country warming to this kind of approach? And what might the s-word portend for 2020?
For months, Trump has been threatening to halt federal subsidies called cost-sharing reductions that insurers say are crucial to the functioning of the marketplaces. Those payments are projected to add up to $7 billion this year and $10 billion next year. Anthem said the lack of clarity on federal cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the return of a tax on insurance coverage played a role in its decision.
Others have done their partisan postmortems on shutdown winners and losers. Instead, we offer four takeaways about the polarized congressional dynamics that more often lead to short-term deals rather than substantive laws.
With Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.
There, we saw that the impact of eliminating the individual mandate was considered almost a nonevent. That sent us scurrying back to a May 2018 estimate by the CBO, where we learned the agency had revised its thinking on the impact of the mandate.
Now the trial is happening, and Trump Derangement Syndrome has been resurrected by the president's defense team as a way to paint the proceedings as nothing more than a sham trial — an expression of pathology rather than patriotism.
But the rest of the defense team has also joined Dershowitz out on the limb he's climbed out on. The White House hosted a conference call for reporters last night to discuss trial strategy. When a source on the president's legal team – as they are required to be identified – was asked about witnesses, this person answered: Well, I don't think that anything that we've said strengthens the case for witnesses. In fact, Professor Dershowitz made it very clear last night that even if everything that came out in the New York Times article were true, there would not be an impeachable offense there.
The backstory is important here: The former governor of Kansas — Republican Sam Brownback, who gained national notoriety for running the state budget into the ground with austerity policies — was ousted by Democrat Laura Kelly after she campaigned in part on a vow to expand Medicaid in the state.
I'm told by my young friends that when you write something in all capital letters, you're yelling, Dingell wrote in the 336-page book. So, let me shout this out: WE HAVE ABDICATED OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE UNITED STATES! Understand this: I'm not saying this as a partisan. I'm talking about anybody in any administration, Republican or Democrat, who thinks they're above the law.
Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America, said Biden, at the start of a meandering answer that ended with a pledge to eliminate tax loopholes for the rich and to repeal Trump's recent tax cuts that helped the wealthy and large corporations. I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy, Biden concluded.
TRUMP: Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.
In the four-page letter, Whitehouse told Barr he was interested in the broad issue of dark money funding in American politics. In doing, so, Whitehouse discussed a nonprofit that previously employed Whitaker, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative advocacy organization.
Proponents of the bill say that nothing will change for veterans. The legislation makes no changes to veterans' health care. Unless they are specifically enrolled in and receiving insurance through the VA, they are eligible for our tax credit, House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman Lauren Aronson said.
Washington state asked voters not to lick envelopes to mail in their ballots, in light of the coronavirus:
My impression is the White House is increasingly engaged on this and making it a priority as they look forward to what is possible this year — assuming one thinks bipartisan legislation is possible in this climate, a senior GOP aide told me. It's an increasing area of focus, so that's encouraging.
TRUMP: I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan. I totally disavow David Duke. I've been doing it now for two weeks, this is your -- you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question. It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups. Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about? You have to tell me which groups?

At one point, DeLauro asked Price whether the administration wanted to repeal or strengthen and improve the 2010 health-care law.
At least in terms of its generic drug goals, the agency ended 2017 with a bang. In October, the FDA announced it had approved 763 generic drug applications so far that year, exceeding previous records of 651 approvals in 2016 and 492 approvals the year prior.
2. Trump also asked Congress for more money to combat childhood cancer.
And every argument the filibuster's defenders make about it — that it produces deliberative debate, that it encourages bipartisanship, that it makes for cooperation and compromise — is simply wrong, as anyone who has been awake for the last couple of decades knows perfectly well.
This afternoon at 3:30, there will be a hearing for General John Kelly as the next secretary of Homeland Security. As President-elect Trump noted, quote General John Kelly's decades of military service and deep commitment to fighting the threat of terrorism inside our borders makes him the ideal choice to serve as our secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. He's the right person to spearhead the urgent mission of stopping illegal immigration and securing our borders, streamlining TSA and improving the coordination between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. With General Kelly at the helm of DHS, the American people will have a leader committed to our safety as well as one who will work hand-in-hand with Americans rank and file, TSA, ICE, and border patrol officers, end quote.
When things calm down, lawmakers can revisit this and make tweaks to Obamacare that both parties can sell back home.
Guy Bentley, director of Consumer Freedom, a libertarian think tank:
Some other context from Bloomberg News's Alex Ruoff:
Sixty-one percent of Americans think upper income Americans pay too little in taxes, a view that's shared by 67 percent of moderates. But majorities of Republicans and conservatives think upper income Americans either pay the right amount or too much. Even more interesting:
(See the video above for even more examples.)
So our politicians seem increasingly like flies stuck in amber. And it's one reason why Trump won is because even though he is a narcissist reality TV star, and many Americans sense that he has massive character problems, he struck people as more authentic than our politicians. And it's because our system has become overrun by these market and institutional incentives that have pummeled the humanity out of otherwise well-meaning public servants.
The move, which flies in the face of Trump's 2016 campaign promise to not cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, is a sharp contrast to the pitch from Democrats who are chanting Medicare-for-all. My colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Sean Sullivan call out the potential problems Trump might face within voters in trying to explain $845 billion in reductions for Medicare, aiming to cut 'waste, fraud and abuse' in the federal program that gives insurance to older Americans.
And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.
Striking such a deal is likely to require even more political acumen than bringing Republicans in line, as it could risk alienating the Republican leadership in Congress and the conservative base. It, too, would necessitate that Trump find stakeholders and power brokers he can trust on the other side of the aisle.
10:40 a.m.: Grassley presses for assurances that Barr will be responsive to Congress
AHH: Blue Cross Blue Shield says it will suspend donations to lawmakers who challenged the electoral college results.
TRUMP: Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I've been involved in Washington. I have been supporting people for many years. And these people have been politicians, and they've been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. I've supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn't a politician, and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now. I hate the term politician.
-- Hillary Clinton's loss has powered a surge of Democratic women seeking office — and, notably, helped spark a wave of female campaign managers. From the New York Times's Michael Tackett: This year, 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast, Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable.
While those details remain to be worked out, Wagner's position could break a standoff over Medicaid and the state budget in Virginia's General Assembly, averting a government shutdown and handing an enormous win to Gov.

Though a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the Senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. Only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. Among Biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for Medicare and expanding Obamacare. Reconciliation could also empower Democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by Republicans as well as portions of Biden's climate and immigration priorities. The Congressional Review Act also will enable Democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the Trump administration with simple majorities. Democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only Democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.
The party leadership in northern Kentucky is very conservative and doesn't always like what he does, Schickel said.
But I don't like his way of saying things. Doing things, he added. He's brash. He doesn't keep to his word, his promises.
The justices have not conducted business in person since March — holding private conferences and oral arguments via teleconference — although they gathered at a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September.
Seniors have certainly received shots at a far higher rate compared with the general U.S. population — of which about 16 percent have been inoculated with at least one dose — but there's still significant work to be done to vaccinate the population most vulnerable to dying or becoming seriously ill from covid-19.

I just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better, I don't care if he's president of United States, owns all the real estate in New York, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. Nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us, Isakson said.
In Gorsuch's words, the law doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.
No less flawed is Warren's demand for worker representation on corporate boards. That may work well in Germany, where there is national wage setting, unions in every company and a culture of labor-management cooperation. But it would be folly to do here.
So it may be no surprise that Democratic activists and much of the liberal or left-leaning news media excoriated Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer's (D-N.Y.) deal with McConnell. Many are asking: Why did Democrats fold so soon?
July: The Senate tries and fails to repeal Obamacare. Donald Trump Jr. is revealed to have met with a Russian lawyer during the campaign.
You do away with that, Buttigieg said, seizing on a rare silent moment to speak for those with their hands up. Buttigieg attacked the Republican Party for President Trump's policy of separating parents and children caught at the border. We should call out hypocrisy when we see it. And for a party that associates itself with Christianity, to suggest that God would smile on the division of families … that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to use religious language again.

Likewise, there remains division between some Republican members of Congress who feel paid leave is an essential benefit for a workforce increasingly led by women and others who argue it amounts to government overreach. The aide described it as an evolving process within the party.
The reality is Republicans leading both chambers of Congress and the White House have acted in ways that could trigger the rise of premiums. They've repealed the law's individual mandate, paving the way for healthier people to leave the marketplaces and leave sicker, more expensive patients behind. They're working to expand leaner plans exempt from ACA coverage requirements. And they haven't found a way to pay extra subsidies in order to defray extra plan costs for the lowest-income customers.

Leaders worry that the Cruz amendment could violate complex budget rules that allow health-care legislation to pass with 51 votes instead of the 60 necessary for most legislation.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN'T BE OVERLOOKED:
Trump theorized that he would be able to bridge partisan gaps in the country by taking an outsider's, businessman's approach to governance. Whether or not voters in the places that voted most heavily for Clinton were ever likely to be swayed is a fair question. Over the course of his first year, Trump hasn't helped himself at all in that goal.
Irsay told the Associated Press he will display the manuscript publicly for several months a year at AA's New York headquarters. I've held it. I've looked through it. It is absolutely mind-blowing, he said. It was just a miracle to see this thing live.
Brat was elected to his first term in 2014, and Kidd said he and other tea party favorites are learning to avoid the mistakes of officials lambasted in sometimes contentious town halls after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
This picture of the House's ­behind-the-scenes work is based on interviews with several people familiar with the thinking of the Republican leadership. All spoke on the condition of anonymity since no plans have been announced.
Trump's quick pivots on how he talks about Obamacare are indeed head-spinning. He spent the early months of his presidency blasting the ACA. But after congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal the law, the president focused on ways his administration could change it on the margins, promising over and over again to offer Americans terrific coverage at a lower cost.
The press honestly is out of control, Trump said.
And the president has yet to embrace the truly unorthodox venues President Barack Obama sought out when he tried to sell the public on Obamacare, like chatting with a YouTube personality perhaps best known for wearing green lipstick and getting into a bathtub of Fruit Loops.
They gave [Trump] such a platform for so many rallies that they had to figure out a mechanism for pointing out that many of his repeated assertions weren't based on fact, she said. He's live on the air promulgating things that are provably not true. [The networks] decided here's the way to deal with it.

Pence's plan, dubbed Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, required co-pays from low-income recipients and charged smokers higher rates. Hospital fees and cigarette taxes covered the state's share of the costs.
* WILL PAUL RYAN SURVIVE? Congressional reporter Billy House reports that the hard-right Freedom Caucus is making noises about ousting Ryan after the elections, but Ryan will probably be able to hang on, anyway:
Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president.
The high cost of prescription drugs is a thorny issue because of the unusually decentralized nature of U.S. health-care system, with many causes and culprits. It's also an issue that Democrats -- and some Republicans -- believe has political resonance leading up to the 2018 midterms, and Democratic lawmakers previewed what they think could be potent lines of attack in their questioning of Azar on Capitol Hill yesterday. That's also true for the issue of whether those with preexisting health conditions can be denied insurance or charged more for it after the Trump administration has now said it won't defend the Affordable Care Act court (more on that below).
Compare that to what Graham told Axios in October. If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing, he said then.
Dramatically reform the agency. Fire the corrupt and incompetent leaders and make it easier for the secretary to fire people. Trump promises to protect and promote honest employees who highlight wrongdoing. These employees will also receive bonuses. (Trump has claimed credit for the VA Choice Act, but it was passed under Obama.)

But what's most notable is the immediate and fierce pushback Summers got, from both inside and outside the administration, which communicated the fact that the administration isn't being influenced by Summers' argument.
The plan, announced Friday by the Biden transition team, pivots sharply from the Trump administration's strategy of holding in reserve roughly half the doses to ensure sufficient supply for people to get a required second shot, our colleagues reported.
President Trump is restricting the path to asylum in his quest to curb immigration into the United States. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
-- Trump's war on immigration, both legal and illegal, could have dramatic consequences on the GOP brand over the long-term. In 1994, California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson embraced Proposition 187 — which denied public services to undocumented immigrants — as a way to gin up turnout for his reelection campaign. It worked, just as it surely still might for Trump in 2018 or 2020. But it was a shortsighted move that ensured multiple generations of Latinos in the Golden State wouldn't vote Republican. It was a turning point that propelled the party toward long-term minority status in the country's most populous state.
Tanto en tono como en sustancia, este presidente pasó su primer día recordando las tradiciones serias y responsables del cargo. Eso se sintió reconfortante, refrescante, nuevo.
That's when the trouble started. A man in an Escalade got out of the car and started screaming.
But crisis is not always sufficient. In 2016, Congress took nearly seven months to allocate $1.1 billion to fight the effects of the Zika virus: Republicans delayed acting on President Barack Obama's request by insisting that the costs be offset by cuts to Obamacare and by adding a rider that blocked Planned Parenthood affiliates in Puerto Rico (Ground Zero in the United States for the virus) from receiving any of the funds in the package. Legislators' ideological and partisan commitments can encourage them to drag their feet, thwarting or delaying action even in a crisis.
The report, provided to The Health 202, compiles data and analysis suggesting the Trump administration's proposal has already had a negative impact on immigrant communities even though the rule has not been finalized.
The bill's proponents will take credit for budgetary savings in the long run while ducking the long-run effects on the number of people in America who have health insurance, said Douglas Elmendorf, a former CBO director.
The compromise that was reached in the House allowing states to opt out of the [insurance] mandates — I think that was a good compromise, but I think more improvement is going to be needed in the Senate, Cruz said.
Today, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) will propose a bucket of policies they say would reduce prescription drug prices in the United States by 50 percent. Two bills would peg the price of U.S. drugs to the median price in five major countries and allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices for Medicare Part D drugs — also nonstarters with Republicans. A third bill allowing drug importation from Canada and other major countries may face brighter prospects.
But since its inception in 2013, and especially since Trump began his march to the White House, One America's owner, Robert Herring Sr., a millionaire who made his money printing circuit boards, has directed his channel to push Trump's candidacy, scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president's troubles, according to more than a dozen current and former producers, writers and anchors, as well as internal emails from Herring and his top news executives.
It would be one thing if it were just going to be really expensive to address the country's problems. In fact, Sanders does not have to spend nearly as much or impose nearly as many federal mandates to achieve the goals he — and virtually all Democrats — desire, such as generous universal health care, affordable college and an aggressive climate program. But he and his backers make it seem as though if you do not support his specific plans to achieve these goals, which call for maximum government control and social benefits that are lavish compared with those of peer nations such as Canada, then you do not care to achieve them at all.
I love campaigning against the Green New Deal. I want [Democrats] to make that a big part of their platform. No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family. … And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes, they were saying, 'Well, how do you get to Europe?' 
I think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes. I think there is something there, Romney says. The reason I think there is a bombshell in there is because every time he is asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays.
As a candidate last year, Trump accused Bezos of buying The Post in 2013 to advocate on behalf of Amazon on issues such as sales taxes and antitrust enforcement. He offered no evidence for his assertions.
WALLACE: Governor Kasich, Democrats, as you know, will make income inequality a big issue in the general election. You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about. Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market. Is he wrong about that? No increase in the minimum wage?
Still, even with the government at least temporarily reopening, workers may not receive a paycheck for days, Samantha writes, meaning workers and their children and former spouses who rely on child-support payments will still feel the squeeze.

-- The Washington Post Editorial Board, which is independent of the news division, endorses the idea of a Green New Deal but opposes the version offered by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). Today's paper has the first editorial in a five-part series outlining what a smarter and more effective Green New Deal would look like. (Read it here.)
AHH: Democrats on Capitol Hill seized onto news that the Trump administration filed a motion to support a full invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, pivoting back to health care and moving away from news of the special counsel report summary that was less damaging to Trump than expected, our colleagues John Wagner, Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report.
If this package was clearly about making sure that schools opened, why is it that less than 5 percent of all spending for schools will only be spent this year?
Barr responded: Under the current rules, that report is supposed to be confidential and treated as the prosecution and declination documents in any other criminal case, and then the attorney general, as I understand the rules, would report to Congress about the conclusion of the investigation. And I believe there may be discretion there about what the attorney general can put in that report.
This is what working for the people of Maryland looks like, particularly when there are threats from the federal government to our health and welfare, Madaleno said.
Listen again to the words of John Roberts to the Tea Party activists who were counting on him: it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices. What else did that mean to them if not: it is not our job to uphold the limits on federal power? Go away from the court house. Go away from the judges. Go away from the Constitution itself and fight this out among yourselves.
Democratic presidential candidates seized on Trump's budget framework Monday, singling out the Medicare cuts.
House Democrats have made clear where they'd like to go on health care, in their ideal world.
That conversation is where Jayapal could run into roadblocks. Given the extensive benefits she's proposing, her bill would probably come at a steep cost to taxpayers — and paying for things is almost always Congress's trickiest task. Of course, supporters of the legislation stress its benefits would fill in much-needed gaps in coverage under the current Medicare program.
All told, there were more than $13 billion in insurance-company losses in the first three years of the exchanges, according to CMS. (This information is provided under a provision of the law that, ironically, limits the profits of insurance companies, known as a medical loss ratio.)
It's encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle putting forward paid family leave proposals, Ivanka Trump said, a statement provided to The Health 202. Twenty-five years after [the Family Medical Leave Act] was passed we finally have bipartisan agreement on the importance of paid leave for working parents. Now we are seeking to build consensus around policy that can garner enough votes to be passed into law.
Wolff writes that one of the reasons Trump didn't want John Bolton, a famously hawkish diplomat, as his national security adviser, was because of his mustache.
Critics have doubted the federal government would keep its promise to cover 90 percent of the $2 billion-a-year cost, at some point saddling the state with the bill. Some also have voiced philosophical objections to opening an entitlement program to childless, able-bodied adults, no matter how poor.
That angst remains pervasive, with members wondering whether Trump is backing the right kind of bills, the sort of agenda that could lift him and the GOP ahead of the 2018 midterms.
In scenes reminiscent of the botched 'Muslim ban' in the early days of the Trump presidency, federal agencies Thursday were largely left to interpret the sudden changes ordered by the White House the day before and figure out how to implement them. A family separation system that had been planned and tested over several months vanished at the president's pen, with no stated plan to reverse its effects. Administration officials held a meeting Thursday evening to grapple with the conflicting understandings of what the executive order was meant to do. People familiar with the discussions said the president had indicated his main goal was to lessen the public controversy surrounding separated families.
-- As for Democrats, they're pulling all sorts of publicity stunts to register their displeasure at both the process and the policy. Yesterday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) livestreamed a visit to the Congressional Budget Office to search for the super secret health-care bill. From Booker communications director Kristin Lynch:
A second point is that senators often vote with their thumbs. They did so during the drawn-out minimum wage vote Friday — a thumbs-up by freshman Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) also made the rounds — and Sinema has in the past been more animated than her colleagues in doing so.
Some of Warren's aides privately hoped she would stay in the race through the Phoenix debate. The former high school debate state champion excelled in that format and raised money after recent strong performances. But she received only 28 of the 1,338 delegates that were available on Tuesday, finishing third in Massachusetts (which she represents in the Senate) and fourth in Oklahoma (where she grew up), although that number may rise slightly from the Golden State.
Nonetheless, the White House is considering a plan, put together by conservative think tanks, that would eliminate the ACA's subsidies for low-income consumers and replace the open-ended federal commitment to Medicaid with a lump-sum payment for each state in the form of a block grant, according to a copy posted online. The proposal largely follows the outlines of a 2017 Republican bill, which the Senate never voted on because it did not garner enough support.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is likely to introduce a substitute version removing those provisions, just as he did back in 2015, when Congress passed a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act that Obama then vetoed.
In effect, the business lobby had allowed itself to accept ­DeLay's logic that its first priority was to maintain Republican control of Congress. And before long, big business found itself in the uncomfortable position of supporting a Republican caucus that was increasingly hostile to its agenda while helping to defeat moderate, pro-business Democrats who had once been its legislative allies.
That statement came as the senator questioned Barr about a November report from Vox that the current acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, advised Trump on how the White House could pressure DOJ to investigate the president's political enemies when Whitaker was serving as the chief of staff at the department.
That's a good question, Whitaker allowed, without furnishing much of an answer.
-- A proposal from the Guatemalan Congress that would grant amnesty to more than 30 convicted former military officers who were found responsible for the deaths of nearly 200,000 during the country's civil war has alarmed civil society groups, the U.N. and the U.S. government. Sandra Cuffe and Mary Beth Sheridan report: The bill, which is expected to be back on Congress's agenda next week, has prompted outrage from Guatemalan civil society groups and organizations representing the indigenous, who make up 40 percent of the population but more than 80 percent of the victims of wartime abuses. … In 2013, Guatemala became the first country to convict a former leader — ex-dictator Efrain Rios Montt — of genocide. (His conviction was overturned on appeal, and he was being retried when he died last year.)
Those images of the Trump's lavish visit clashed jarringly with pictures of protesters, speaking out against Modi's anti-Muslim policies, being viciously attacked by police:
I think there's a little bit of once burned, why are we going at it again? Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters Thursday.

— When Sen. Kamala Harris advocated at a CNN town hall this week for doing away with private health insurance to make way for Medicare-for-All, she stepped into an area of specifics that made her vulnerable to criticism.
-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he is refocusing his panel's investigation on whether the president or any of his advisers have been under the influence of a foreign government, an act that would not necessarily trigger criminal charges from the special counsel's investigation. NBC News's Ken Dilanian reports: In fact, most FBI counterintelligence investigations don't result in criminal charges, experts say, because they tend to involve secret intelligence that either can't be used in court or doesn't add up to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the FBI assesses that a government official is compromised by a foreign adversary, officials often will quietly remove that person from a sensitive role or wall him or her off from classified information. Obviously, none of that is an option for the president of the United States.
Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins called the move evidence of the collapsing abortion industry:
Georgetown officials said it was unclear what action, if any, it would take on Nomani's complaints.
Finally, we asked, Who would you rather see bad things happen to: [opposing party] politicians, or [own party] politicians who vote against the party on a key issue? Three-quarters chose neither, and 10 percent chose the other party. Nine percent wished harm equally against in-party defectors and partisan opponents. And 4 percent declared that defectors — apostates — deserved more harm.
The nation's governors are ready to work with leaders in Washington to make health care more accessible and affordable to the people we serve, they wrote. However, governors must be given adequate time to determine the impact any health care bill will have on their states and residents, and ensure that the bill does not adversely harm the people we were elected to serve.
There's a lot of things that are vague and can be open to misinterpretation or lead to unintended consequences, Gabbard said. Fracking [hydraulic fracturing] and nuclear power are two things that are not mentioned in that resolution at all. The waste that is produced by nuclear power is waste that we're going to have to deal with forever.
Reciting a familiar list of ways the law has helped people, whether they have marketplace insurance or any other kind, the president said that the doomsday predictions of the law's GOP naysayers have not been borne out. But he said that doesn't mean there aren't some legitimate concerns about how the law is working now. The main issue has to do with folks who still aren't getting enough help.

-- Trump's other defense attorneys took other tacks as they wrapped up their arguments. Jay Sekulow dismissed Bolton's unpublished manuscript as unsourced, even though the source is Bolton. If you want to call that evidence — I don't know what you'd call that — I'd call it inadmissible, he said. Sekulow maintains that the president at all times acted with perfect, legal, authority. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone suggested that, even if senators think Trump abused his office, the decision should be left to voters since this is an election year. The election is only months away, he said. The American people are entitled to choose their president.
In a sign Sunday of the ripple effects on the GOP's conservative flank, one high-profile member of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Ted Poe (R-Tex.), resigned from the group and took a swipe at its opposition to the Trump-backed health-care bill.

I said look, if they use Azar to negotiate a bill he's at least knowledgeable. The question is how much direction does he get from [Office of Management and Budget] and the White House on it?
Okay, so none of this may actually be all that surprising, even the Affordable Care Act lawsuit. A crisis may alter our behavior and temporarily reshuffle our priorities, but it doesn't change our values. Democrats still want everyone to have health coverage and Republicans still don't, even amid a public-health catastrophe.

Trump has been grudging about even that slight show of restraint. At a rally in Arizona a month after the Obamacare vote, Trump said this of McCain: I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't it? Very presidential.
A less credulous interpretation, though, is that he's just someone who cares about tax cuts more than anything else. But that, as New York's Jonathan Chait points out, is a story that, even though it explains Ryan's career about as well as possible, has been heavily resisted by news media that have invested a lot in the idea of him as a different type of Republican. One who's so principled that he's willing to say what others won't about cutting Medicare and Medicaid. A brave teller of brave truths. Never mind that it didn't make any sense that his plan to eventually balance the budget involved what would have been the biggest tax cut in history. Or, as Paul Krugman tried to get people to understand for years, that it wasn't really a plan to balance the budget at all, since it assumed that its tax cuts wouldn't cost any money, and it relied on a combination of unrealistic and unspecified spending cuts for its savings. Nonetheless, pundits still celebrated him for giving us a place to start, and anti-debt groups like the Concord Coalition feted him with things like a Fiscy award.
-- Detailed information on nearly every registered American voter — including information on ethnicity religion, and views on political issues — were left exposed on the Internet for 12 days by a Republican contractor that works for the RNC and other GOP clients. Brian Fung, Craig Timberg and Matea Gold report: The data offered a strikingly complete picture of the voting histories and political leanings of the American electorate laid out on an easily downloadable format, said cyber-security researcher Chris Vickery. He discovered the unprotected files of 198 million voters in a routine scan of the Internet last week and alerted law enforcement officials. The precision and volume of the information … highlights the rising sophistication of the data-mining efforts that have become central to modern political campaigns. In some cases, that included which voters are suspicious of Wall Street and pharmaceutical firms, or who reluctantly voted for [Clinton] or supports the Affordable Care Act Vickery said. The company also kept information on Americans' voting histories and their reported enthusiasm for Trump.… They're using this information to create political dossiers on individuals that are now available for anyone, said Jeffrey Chester, of the Center for Digital Democracy. These political data firms might as well be working for the Russians.

A person who fell into this category would face insurance rates that could be based on their individual condition, for one year. (States that seek a waiver would need to provide ways to help make up the difference in costs.) After that, people would qualify for prices at the community rate, rather than based on their individual conditions.
Bloomberg stood there like a deer in headlights as his rivals went after him for his demeaning comments about women, his nondisclosure agreements with female employees who accused him of sexual harassment and gender discrimination, his stop-and-frisk policy, his opposition to Obamacare, his past support for Republican candidates and his attempt to buy the Democratic nomination. He had no clever retorts, much less competent responses. It was painful to watch. Not since Jeb Bush stumbled over a question in 2015 on whether the war in Iraq was a mistake has a candidate been so woefully unprepared for such an obvious line of questioning. Bloomberg never smiled. He rolled his eyes. He was not likable or prepared. His best moments came during the long stretches in which the other candidates attacked one another while he effectively disappeared from the debate.
A third Senate Republican appeared to waver in recent weeks, as Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier) did not rule out voting for expansion, according to the Winchester Star.
Boosted Obamacare subsidies will soon be available on Healthcare.gov, and people with lower incomes will see more plans with zero premiums.

So, could Fink's letter be its own public relations maneuver? Bloomberg Gadfly's Stephen Gandel suggests as much, noting the investment chief has used the annual message to call for greater corporate social responsibility before, with little apparent follow-up. Fink's bark is always going to be louder than his bite, he writes. BlackRock does nearly all of its stock market investing through index funds. So, no matter how much it disapproves of a company's stance on the environment or whatever, it can't actually sell.
They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country.

And it's all because of devaluation.

In the past, conservatives have thrown in the towel
-- A change to the byzantine caucus rules could leave uncommitted Iowans stuck in a viable group, which is panicking campaigns. From the Des Moines Register: Democratic operatives are encouraging Iowa caucusgoers to declare support for a candidate in the beginning of the caucus-night process — even if they may not intend to see that candidate through to the end — to prevent the uncommitted group from securing viability. At a Democratic caucus, Iowans begin by breaking up into groups based on their candidate preference. Due to a new rule change outlined in the Iowa Democratic Party's 74-page Delegate Selection Plan, if a group gains viability — reaches 15 percent of attendees' support and earns a delegate for the county convention — those caucusgoers are locked in and unable to switch to another group.
Barr said he ultimately told the president he wasn't interested in being his lawyer.
The takeaway? Maybe ACA advocates should be thanking the power of the press for helping keep the system intact -- for now.
The only problem: A medical products maker had already registered that name as its own. Mechner, now 87, proposed swapping the i for a y, rendering the word as Chyron. The name stuck.
In response to Bigtree's demonstration, the official account of the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum in Poland tweeted:

There is no question that race has resurfaced in an ugly manner in American politics, driven by an overtly racist president. But culture and identity are much broader than race. Gender is at least as important: Men have been losing status and economic power to women in workplaces and families steadily for the past generation. Many people in 2016 didn't so much support Trump as vote against Hillary Clinton, who represented to them a certain kind of self-satisfied feminism and came into the election with very low trust and favorability ratings.
Checks and Balances, as Conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the Federalist Society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at Yale. And now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.

Thank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.
But if FDA gives Sublocade orphan drug status – thereby giving it exclusive selling rights for five more years – it would restrict similar treatments from coming online during what is widely acknowledged to be a public health crisis, affecting millions of people. That goes against the whole intent of the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, passed by Congress specifically to help people on the margins.
The director of engagement for the conservative Blaze Media cast a spotlight on O'Rourke's dog:
Democrats spent much of last week hurling similar criticisms at the administration. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) used Democrats' weekly address on Saturday to slam the president's budget for proposing $848 billion in cuts to Medicare.
And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton. You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain. Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people.
But when the Penn Wharton Budget Model did an independent analysis, it estimated that the 10-year revenue would be only $3.3 trillion, a 24 percent drop from Sanders's forecast. Worse, this estimate disregards the effects of the new tax on the economy. When that is included — economic growth is lowered — the added revenue from the tax falls to $2.8 trillion over 10 years, a 36 percent decline. Taxpayers rearrange their affairs to minimize taxes.
In a tantalizing exchange that raised more questions than it answered, Barr told lawmakers he had spoken to White House officials about Mueller.
Even before House Republicans withdrew legislation last week that would have jettisoned key aspects of the ACA, White House officials had pledged to pursue a phase two through executive action. This stage could cover everything from how aggressively the government promotes enrollment under the law to what sort of financial support it gives to prop up the ACA marketplace.
My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program.

Last week, while speaking to an audience at the University of California at Los Angeles, she addressed a group of, apparently, Black Lives Matter protesters by saying:
Wolff says that his book is based on 200 conversations over the past 18 months with Trump, most members of his senior staff, some of whom he talked to dozens of times, and many people with whom they had spoken. Some conversations were on the record, while others were off the record or on deep background, allowing him to relay a disembodied description of events provided by an unnamed witness to them.
Over the weekend, more than 200 outside groups signed onto a letter of support for Omar. One reason, said several group leaders who signed, was to show Pelosi and her leadership team that it was acceptable to defend Omar.
Key excerpt: So mortifying was this development that when Reince Priebus, the RNC head, was called to New York from Washington for an emergency meeting at Trump Tower, he couldn't bring himself to leave Penn Station.

We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true.

One big question: what the CBO will project on how many states will waive the prohibition on jacking up rates on preexisting conditions. This could make the bill politically more dangerous.
The program will merge public-health training with traditional medical school teachings to train health-care professionals who can care for patients properly even if they don't have water or electricity.
The Senate version lacks such a deterrent, and that prospect has unnerved the insurance industry, whose leaders worry that consumers will postpone buying coverage until they get sick and need care. That sort of behavior would drive up costs and prices.
So it's anybody's guess as to whether Kavanaugh — presumably along with conservative Justices Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito — will be willing to wade into sticky questions such as whether Indiana and other states can ban a pregnant woman from obtaining an abortion who learns her child would be born with Down syndrome, another genetic illness or physical deformities.

With the exception of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), for example, every Democratic senator running for president has endorsed Medicare-for-all legislation, which if implemented would phase in a national health plan with only limited roles for private insurers.
We have deferred these and other difficult decisions. Instead of cutting spending or raising taxes, successive presidents and Congresses have covered the gaps by borrowing. Since 1961, federal deficits have occurred in all but five years (1969 and 1998-2001). Even these materialized only at the end of the long economic booms of the 1960s and late 1990s.

Trump confounds these people because he's always a step or two ahead, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners on Monday. It's a direct line to the Democrat Party and Obama and members of the Obama administration that Trump is signaling, 'You don't face the usual feckless bunch of opponents who never fight you back.'
The Republicans' counterintuitive move seeks to exacerbate real divisions within the Democratic Party on how far and how fast to move beyond Obamacare and chart a course toward Medicare for All, Alice writes. Senior Democrats leading the House's health committees blasted the GOP request as 'cynical' and 'disingenuous' and said it would not affect their timeline for weighing the policy.
Then there are the doctors and physicians whose reimbursements would go up under single-payer. Richard Bruno, a doctor in east Baltimore who primarily sees low-income Medicaid patients, said low reimbursement rates make it difficult for his clinic to purchase the equipment he needs, like replacement microscopes.

To put the demand in perspective, the Texas Department of Insurance received just 43 requests for mediation in 2013, they write. The following year, the number surged to more than 600 — and the numbers have climbed steeply ever since. The requests hit a record high of 4,519 in 2018, and regulators expect 8,000 this fiscal year.
The timing creates a juxtaposition between Democratic economic security prescriptions for workers, such as raising the minimum wage and paid family leave, and Trump tax reform and federal budget policies that, Democrats say, are at odds with his populist campaign oath to prioritize forgotten Americans from the factory floors of the Rust Belt to the sawmills of the Mountain West.
Those are just a handful of the more than 30 programs the White House is proposing to Congress for 'rescission,' a process of culling back money that was previously authorized, Erica and Damian explain. Once the White House sends the request to Congress, lawmakers have 45 days to vote on the plan or a scaled-back version of it through a simple majority vote. If approved by Congress, the reductions would represent less than 0.4 percent of total government spending this year.
OPERATOR: And next, we'll go to Zeke Miller with Time.
Legislating takes time, he said. It's worth remembering it took Obama 14 months to pass Obamacare, he said. The House repeal bill was on the floor for 14 days. That's not nearly long enough to draft legislation as consequential as this.
It's a mixed legacy for a lawmaker who joined Congress as a young and idealistic policy wonk two decades ago and reached the greatest heights Capitol Hill has to offer, yet failed repeatedly to bring his ideas to fruition or turn his rhetoric into reality.

There's no denying the sweeping 2010 health-care law resulted in palpable changes to the U.S. health-care system, despite some major stumbles and roadblocks along the way. It nearly halved the country's now-8.5 percent uninsured rate. It guaranteed coverage for the 50 million Americans with preexisting conditions. It mandated more generous coverage for millions more.

These essential health benefits (or EHBs) are among the Obamacare regulations that Republicans have blamed for skyrocketing premiums in the marketplaces, as they mean everyone buys plans with benefits they may not need or want. While EHBs are a major boon to certain customers – like a young woman who may need maternity coverage, for example – they also mean those individuals with fewer health-care needs may not be able to purchase as lean or as cheap of a plan as they may want.

The first has to do with the central contention that our current polarization is fundamentally about race.

How it was resolved Senate Democrats bowed to pressure to reopen the government when Republicans committed to hold a vote resolving the status of dreamers by mid-February. Read more
Up until now, states have received an open-ended federal match for Medicaid funding, with the exact amount of federal dollars fluctuating based on need. For example, federal Medicaid funding automatically rises when recession strikes and more people qualify for public coverage.
AHH: For the transgender community in Maryland and Virginia, there are very few options for medical care, forcing people to drive hours to find critical services. Whitman-Walker Health, a D.C. provider specializing in LGBTQ care, served 1,837 patients last year, and more than half of them lived in Virginia or Maryland. About 50 traveled from as far as South Carolina and Alabama for care, our Post colleague Samantha Schmidt reports.
Trump doesn't really seem to take the position seriously, she said. Take his advisers seriously. Listen to or respect his adversaries or opponents in any way.
We cool, we still love Trump?
Sinema's vote in some ways recalls another Arizona senator, the late John McCain (R), whose demonstrable thumbs-down on a Republican effort in 2017 to repeal of the Affordable Care Act effectively killed the bill. That too was cast as being gratuitous by fellow Republicans, and President Donald Trump never let him forget about it.
Last June, Congress passed a VA accountability bill — which Trump signed while flanked by CVA officials. Lawmakers also have authorized billions of dollars for private care outside VA in the wake of the 2014 scandal. Concerned Veterans for America is now pushing an expansion of the choice program, which the White House has called a top priority.
-- While top Democrats are increasingly alarmed that Sanders could gain unstoppable momentum from the early states, they also fear that any anti-Sanders effort would backfire, and that has sidelined a more significant stop-Sanders effort for now. Matt Viser and Annie Linskey report: Even the hint of an organized anti-Sanders movement would risk alienating the Vermont senator's sometimes belligerent supporters and play into claims that the process is 'rigged,' many Democrats say privately. Democratic House candidates in swing districts say they are nervous about running on the same ticket as Sanders, but they, too, are reluctant to say so publicly.
At the same time, that perception has clearly worn thin in recent years.
Ventilators and intensive care units, necessary to keep the most acutely ill patients alive, are largely limited to larger hospitals and academic medical centers in cities. … Nationwide, worries are growing about a lack of hospital beds to quarantine and treat infected patients. Major medical centers are typically full even without a flood of coronavirus patients, Christopher Rowland and Peter Whoriskey report. Despite weeks of preparations, health planners continue to fret about shortages of masks and gowns for hospital staff, as well as lifesaving mechanical respirators for patients with severe cases of the disease. … Budget-conscious health systems do not maintain large volumes of reserve supplies just for the possibility of a pandemic, said William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. That leaves the system vulnerable. … Federal funding for emergency preparedness in health care has been in a slow, steady decline for more than 15 years.
But here's what Trump didn't mention: His administration is refusing to defend in court a challenge against the ACA which could dismantle its protections for patients with preexisting medical conditions.
[Barr's] appointment only helps to further the Trump administration's relentless campaign against women's essential reproductive rights, said Adrienne Kimmell, vice president of communications for NARAL Pro-Choice America. Barr's confirmation is Trump's latest move to use his administration as a weapon against women and our most fundamental right to control our own bodies and decide our own destinies.
The Senate Finance Committee holds a hearing on drug pricing on Tuesday.
We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we're able to get vaccines in people's arms, Biden told reporters at the White House. The last thing, the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking, that, 'In the meantime, everything's fine. Take off your mask.' 
Ryan acknowledged Wednesday that more work needs to be done. And it really is entitlements. But he added that he was proud that the House had passed what he described as the biggest entitlement reform bill ever considered in the House of Representatives, a reference to legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act and remaking the Medicaid program. That bill was rejected by the Senate.
Strikingly, Warren's proposal to end the electoral college is now one of her biggest applause lines. The crowds love it. Democrats, after all, have now won the national popular vote but lost the presidency four times now: in 2016 and 2000, as well as 1888 and 1876. (To be fair, it was a very, very, very different party in the 19th century.)
As a privately-held company, it has been Purdue Pharma's longstanding policy not to comment on our financial or legal strategy, the company told Reuters in a statement. We are, however, committed to ensuring that our business remains strong and sustainable. We have ample liquidity and remain committed to meeting our obligations to the patients who benefit from our medicines, our suppliers and other business partners.
In early October, after reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had called Trump a moron, other senior advisers had there-but-for-the-grace-of-God moments, Wolff writes. Some had called Trump an idiot, dumb as s--- and a dope, according to Wolff.

Consequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.
While JUUL has promised to address youth vaping through its modest voluntary efforts, by accepting $12.8 billion from Altria—a tobacco giant with such a disturbing record of deceptive marketing to hook children onto cigarettes —JUUL has lost what little remaining credibility the company had when it claimed to care about the public health, the senators wrote.

Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
Of the 20 percent of partisans who strongly agreed that the opposing party is downright evil, 10 percent often wished death on disloyal party leaders. That's more than we found in the 25 percent of those who somewhat agreed, where 6 percent wished for in-party opponents' deaths, and three times more than the majority who did not see the other party as evil.
Beijing does not share Washington's ambivalence about the U.N. It rightly recognizes the world body as a forum where 21st-century great-power aspirations may be realized or dashed. The Biden administration should see it the same way. Suzanne Nossel is a former deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations.
On the first day in office, get rid of gun-free zones at military bases, recruiting centers and, in some cases, schools. These zones are like target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. (Fact check)
Cancel federal funding to sanctuary cities that choose to not prosecute undocumented immigrants for being in the country illegally. (According to PolitiFact, Overall, the Justice Department has not been successful in withholding federal funds for so-called sanctuary cities.)
MCCONNELL: You know, John was never one not to have an opinion and sometimes expressed it very forcefully.
Several conservative states, including Texas, wrote the court on Monday, asking for it to hold off deciding, the Hill reports.
Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.
You wrote that Susan Collins is the worst, that Tom Cotton is a fraud, that vampires have more heart than Ted Cruz. You called Leader McConnell 'Moscow Mitch' and 'Voldemort,' and on and on, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said to Tanden during the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on Tuesday.
SPEAKER: I'm Shannon Estes (ph). And my daughter Shaley Estes (ph), 22 years old, was murdered here in Phoenix last July 24 by a Russian who overstayed his visa. And vote Trump.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) noted that reality in a Monday interview with CNN. He said that the House bill remains a work in progress and that some of it would be scrapped in negotiations.
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
Oakley did not respond to requests for comment. Her email warned producers that failing to put Trump speeches on the air will result in a written warning/write-up from here on out.
Still, putting a sense of scale on the problem, the FBI director said his agents were pursuing about 2,000 domestic terrorism cases.
The federal government has done a lot, and it's going to do a lot, Trump said Tuesday during a briefing at the White House. We're going to do, perhaps, infrastructure, which you wouldn't have gotten approved before. And now people are looking to do it.
I also have to demand the release of Trevor Reed, the Marine from Texas who's being held as a political pawn in Russia. It's what the KGB does, unfortunately very well.
Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on Tuesday introduced a bill called the Stop STUPIDITY Act. In the event of a lapse in government funding, the act would reinstate funding levels from the previous fiscal year — except for Congress and the office of the president, which would not receive funding until they reached an agreement.
Even on his last day on the campaign trail, Cruz held steady with his use of random pop culture references and impersonations. Here are a few examples you can find in the video above.

Watch the courtroom bursts into applause after Larry Nassar's sentencing:
The latest change aims to provide a stronger incentive for younger and healthier Americans to maintain health insurance, by making consumers who drop their policies for 63 days or more face a six-month waiting period before coverage may begin in the following year.
The question is whether those bonds can translate into legislative victory.
Most top corporate executives, however, have remained quiet lest they become targets of Trump's personal attacks, as did Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg when he dared to challenge Trump over immigration.

We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about.
OUCH: Just as a bill in Utah to limit voter-approved Medicaid expansion is moving quickly through the state legislature, lawmakers in Idaho are also working on a measure pushing back on expansion of the program.
Parkinson didn't know about the efforts to eject the president's ostensible supporters from the county party committee. She rolled her eyes at the notion that she might be for Trump — neither he nor Clinton got her vote four years ago, she said — and conceded that her Facebook jabs might have gone too far. Maybe I am too loud, she allowed.
The study unexpectedly found a rise in overdose deaths caused by methadone in states that expanded Medicaid. The drug is most commonly known as a treatment for opioid use disorder, but it is also prescribed for pain, though much less frequently than drugs like oxycodone.
Republicans — in what surely amounts to a vote of no confidence in Saccone — are already blaming him as a lackluster candidate. By contrast, Democrats seem to have hit the jackpot with a telegenic, conservative Democrat who served in the Marines and as a U.S. attorney. (He's not a vocal advocate of greater gun control and publicly seems ambivalent on the matter of abortion: a Catholic, he's spoken out against certain pieces of pro-life legislation while also echoing his personal unease with the practice, Time magazine reports. His bread-and-butter issues are supporting labor and combating the opioid crisis. He's already earned the support of a number of unions in the region.)
The estimate also showed that the bill would cut $880 billion from the Medicaid program over the next decade. The program provides health insurance to low-income Americans and helps pay for long-term care for seniors and people with disabilities.
And expanding government subsidies for private insurance is the low-hanging fruit when it comes to Democratic health overhaul goals. Bolder moves, such as adding a government-backed public option plan to the marketplaces or lowering Medicare's eligibility age to 60 or even 55, will be much trickier given the party's slim majorities in Congress.

The Trump associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the White House, said that Trump was disappointed in Meadows and others in the caucus and wanted to remind them that he can use his powers to make their lives more difficult if they are not with him in the future.

But Nielsen was against the push, telling the president that federal court orders prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from reinstating the policy, and that he would be reversing his own executive order from June that ended family separations, Julia and Geoff write.
Katie writes some in the marijuana industry have speculated whether Sessions's actions could force Congress to step in and regulate the market, or move to legalize marijuana altogether. And based on the study's findings, there could be a financial incentive to do so.
The current penalty for not having health coverage is $695 per adult and $347.50 per child — up to $2,085 per family — or 2.5 percent of family income, whichever is greater. About 6.5 million taxpayers paid a fine for being uninsured in 2015, according to the Internal Revenue Service, although the fine that year was $470 per adult.

Barr singled out in particular the asylum system, which he said was being abused by migrants who are coached on what to say to those processing their claims and eventually released into the United States because there are not enough facilities to hold them.
They need to be the voice in the Senate saying premiums need to go down, he said of conservatives. The Freedom Caucus has made it clear that if it's not a good bill, they're not going to vote for it. And I have a lot of confidence this is going to get done.
The president, who can't spare a single vote in the Senate, is trying to unify Democrats behind his $1.9 trillion measure, as the Senate prepares to move forward on it this week. Several moderates have raised concerns about the structure of unemployment insurance benefits and aid for state and local governments.
So far, Biden hasn't joined the call to end the filibuster. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is holding open the possibility, saying he's watching to see how much Republicans obstruct. The matter could come to a head in coming weeks or months as the Senate turns to key Biden-backed proposals expected to face broad GOP opposition, including a big infrastructure package, a rewrite of voting rights law and changes to immigration policies.
Then, over the weekend, Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, sparked a national debate with his declaration that the inauguration had been the most watched ever — period. Then, on Monday, Trump began a bipartisan reception for House and Senate leaders at the White House by reiterating his belief that between 3 million and 5 million people had voted illegally. That explained, he said, how Clinton defeated him in the popular vote.
For the most part, the media abided by a ban on writing about her awkward years, as it does for other White House children. And the Clintons left no stone unturned to protect her, once complaining to Saturday Night Live about a bland reference to her looks as an adolescent.
But as the days tick by, it's less and less likely Republicans will find an answer to their central dilemma: How to take government out of people's health care without costing some people their health care.
It's a prime example of the I'm-rubber-you're-glue strategy that helped Trump win the presidency in the first place. In this case it's a term to describe ​not the conspiracy-flogging kooks who violently stormed the Capitol in Trump's name, armed with bear spray and body armor; but rather the lawmakers arguing that the ex-president should be held responsible for their actions.
The policy bars sales of fruit-, dessert- and mint-flavored pods but not sales of tobacco- and menthol-flavored cartridges, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports. It also exempts disposable flavored e-cigarettes — which come in an array of teen-appealing flavors and often have high nicotine concentrations — as well as thousands of flavored e-liquids and open-tank systems that are used more often by adults.
The 'yes,' end the filibuster camp, including:
Trump and his officials have argued these unprecedented transparency measures will ultimately induce hospitals to lower their prices because patients will be able to start shopping around and insurers will have more leverage to negotiate plan rates. Such negotiations have long been cloaked in secrecy, making it extremely difficult for patients to learn how much a service might cost and where they could obtain it less expensively.
The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations holds a hearing on rising insulin costs on Tuesday.
Researchers with the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne announced on Wednesday that they have grown the coronavirus from a patient sample, potentially paving the way for more scientific breakthroughs. It was the first time such an experiment had succeeded outside of China, the scientists said. They hope that the sample — set to be shared with laboratories around the world — will help to speed up efforts to develop a vaccine and to diagnose the virus in patients without symptoms. … China has [also] handed over the genome of the coronavirus to Russia in a joint effort between the two countries to create a vaccine…
The controversy raises a key question: Who is a Trump supporter? The state party's bylaws allow for the ejection of an officer who by voice, vote, financial support or otherwise supported a candidate opposed to the duly nominated candidate of the Democratic Party within the past two years. Has a committee member who declares Go Trump on Face­book clearly broken that rule?
Multiple Republicans familiar with the Senate GOP leadership's strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, said there is a particular focus on winning over two of the four GOP senators who issued a joint statement of disapproval on Thursday: Cruz and Ron Johnson (Wis.). The other two, Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.), are seen by leadership as likelier to vote no.
But now, Trump is turning his back on seniors and families — proposing over two trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, the ad says. Breaking his promise. Slashing our health care to the bone. And for what? Tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations.
Primary care doctors in small practices could increase their Medicare revenue by as much as 50 percent but would risk losing no more than 10 percent. Larger practices could choose between two options, a version where they could stand to gain or lose up to 50 percent of their payments and a risker version where 100 percent of payments would be at stake.

Alexander is a respected longtime senator and former governor who stands to go down in Tennessee history. Even if he thought voting for new witnesses was the right thing to do, it's only natural for a politician — someone from a line of work that rewards self-preservation and requires a constant eye on public opinion — to weigh the upsides and the downsides.
Set up safe zones in Syria and then force wealthy Persian Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia to pick up the bill. They're going to put up all the money. We're not going to put up money. We're going to lead it, and we'll do a great a job. But we're going to get the Gulf states to put up the money. (Trump continued talking about the idea, but there is no indication they've been set up or funded as he suggested.)
Hey guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight — they want to know how we are going to put food on their table, she said, drawing loud applause.
Under questioning from the Republican senator, he was also sharply critical of former FBI director James B. Comey's handling of the Clinton email case that roiled the 2016 election.
This is going to be Biden's last stand because he thinks that black people are going to support him just because of Barack Obama, said Connie Breeden, an attorney in Columbia who is African American. He's tooting that horn all the way to the bank. But people are savvier than that. He hasn't done anything. What has he actually done for us? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I'm leaning toward Steyer because he's really put his money where his mouth is.
Now is the time for some organizing, Obama said, according to a transcript published by the White House at the time. An election just finished, so it's not going to be straight political organizing, but it is going to be raising awareness; it's going to be the work you're doing in nonprofits and advocacy and community-building. And over time, what's going to happen is, is that you will reinvigorate and inform our politics in ways that we can't anticipate.
I suspect the advocates for the bill will say that's their guarantee, he said. I will insist that the president's pledges be met. And the president pledged that he would take care of people with preexisting conditions.

The problem for the president and Republicans is that the ideas presented to lawmakers Thursday are sparking major divisions among their party. Medicaid, for instance, is a flash point between hard-line conservatives who want to significantly roll back federal spending and members from states that took advantage of the ACA's Medicaid expansion and are now wary of reducing coverage.
Dr. Bandy Lee's opinions are her own and do not represent the views of the department, the medical school or the university, Yale School of Medicine said in a statement.
I've always been for a public option so I'm always eager to talk about that, Pelosi told reporters yesterday during her weekly media briefing, when asked if Democrats would advance such legislation if they win the House.

Speaking at the World Health Care Conference, Price had said that there are many, and I'm one of them, who believe that that actually will harm the pool in the exchange market, because you'll likely have individuals who are younger and healthier not participating in that market, and consequently that drives up the cost for other folks within that market.

What's more, Republicans have regularly held power in Congress in recent years. Throughout most of the postwar era, astute political observers assumed that Democrats had a permanent congressional majority. Minority status encouraged congressional Republicans to accept half a loaf and move on. Now, as Frances Lee notes, majority control is up for grabs in almost every election. That competitiveness encourages the parties to heighten their messaging and discourages conservatives from giving up on ACA repeal.
Now Democrats seem to have wholly and enthusiastically assumed the Obamacare gloom-and-doom mantle, jumping on any chances to spread negative marketplace news far and wide. They're the ones, not Republicans, seeking to leverage the law to their advantage in the upcoming midterm elections, which will take place five days into the 2019 open enrollment season.

Rep. Chaffetz (R-Utah) is leaving Congress at the end of this month so it's no surprise perhaps that the House Oversight chairman — whose job it is to hold the administration accountable — is letting loose. But there's also significant criticism of House Republicans, who are being attacked for writing a major overhaul of the health-care system behind closed doors.
But several voters I've interviewed around South Carolina have wondered why Obama's not endorsing Biden if they're so close. Biden claimed last April, dubiously, that he asked Obama not to endorse him so that the president could stay neutral. Others said they've seen ads online from Bloomberg highlighting how close he was with Obama as New York's mayor.
Most others are insured by Medicare, the national program for seniors and the disabled, or Medicaid, the joint state-federal program for those with lower incomes. Unfortunately, in 2012, the Supreme Court ordered that the ACA's Medicaid expansion be optional for the states. Fourteen states still have not expanded, leaving about 2 to 4 million people without an option for affordable insurance now. Altogether, 28 million people remain uninsured — mostly because they never signed up, did not know their options, or are priced out.

The Supreme Court turned down a chance yesterday to quickly decide a lawsuit that could dismantle the 2010 health-care law and its provision of coverage for millions of Americans.

-- Trump, with NASA, has a new rocket and spaceship. Where's he going to go? by Joel Achenbach: NASA is building a jumbo rocket. It's called the Space Launch System, or simply the SLS. The core stage of the SLS is slowly materializing in a sprawling facility on the outskirts of [New Orleans].… But [first], the new rocket will have to survive the unpredictable crosswinds of Washington. President Trump is now in charge of the space program, and no one in Washington seems to have a clear idea what's going to happen next. [Bush 43] wanted U.S. boots on the moon by 2020. [Obama] killed the Bush program, saying we'd been there and done that. But with Republicans in control of both Congress and the White House, the moon looms larger in the sky. Last month, in his address to Congress, Trump made a single, enigmatic comment about space: 'American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.' Did that mean the moon? Mars?
So our working group endorsed compulsory licensing, or allowing government to greenlight the generic production of expensive branded medicines in cases of medical necessity. Public drug manufacturing (which already happens in Sweden) should also be an option, as a last resort to combat price gouging — and to deal with shortages that have left hospitals scrounging for basic essentials like IV fluids and post-op pain medications as commercial manufacturers have faltered.
-- The Trump administration has missed the deadline, established by law, to turn over to Congress an unclassified report on Khashoggi's murder and the role played by the regime in Riyadh. From BuzzFeed News: In December, lawmakers passed a sweeping defense bill that included a provision ordering the director of national intelligence to send Congress an unclassified report identifying those responsible for Khashoggi's death at a Saudi Arabian consulate in 2018. The legislation set the deadline for the report at 30 days, which passed earlier this week.
Three top House Democrats endorsed Shalanda Young to replace Neera Tanden as Office of Management and Budget chief nominee.
Both Senate Republicans and Democrats say ending these automatic spending cuts is their priority. They must find a way to raise these caps if they want to come to a long-term spending deal.
TRUMP: ... is it's total gridlock. Nobody gets along. We need people to get along. We need to be able to get things done.
The lawsuit alleges Purdue deceived patients and doctors about the risks of opioids, pushed prescribers to keep patients on the drugs longer and aggressively targeted vulnerable populations, like the elderly and veterans, Allanna reports.
The other thing is that I've said to people if you look at the Kaiser polls, Medicare-for-all falls apart once you start telling people what it will cost [and] that they'll have to give up their existing health insurance. I debated my opponents on Medicare-for-all. I had four or five opponents to my left. They were all for Medicare-for-all. I said, 'Look, I'd like to expand access to Medicare,' but we were at a labor union. I said, 'Every person in this union has better health insurance then Medicare, so tell them that they have to give up their health insurance.'
The Trump administration deserves credit for Operation Warp Speed, the program that helped to fund the vaccines, and the private sector deserves credit for the miraculous speed and effectiveness with which it developed the vaccines. But, for the most part, President Donald Trump left the rollout to the states. Last March, Ron Klain, now Biden's chief of staff, observed that the Trump administration was approaching the pandemic, a massive national crisis, as if the country were still living under the Articles of Confederation.
• Raise to 125,000 the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. in 2021. That's up from Trump's cap of 18,000 in 2020, and from the target of 110,000 for 2016, the year before Trump became president.
Trump's declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans — moderates and conservatives — expressed anxiety last week about the party's lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once his plan is made public, Trump said, he is confident that it could get enough votes to pass in both chambers. He declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats.
Sanders held his own in the foreign-policy-focused second hour of the debate, something he had not done in debates past. And he had one of his best moments of the exchange at an unlikely time — in response to a question about his criticism of Bill Clinton's past behavior. Sanders turned the question into one focused on how the campaign he is running is about policy, not personal differences — to much applause.
So, why are they still around?: It's a leftover of the immediate post-reform era, when the Democratic Party was out of the White House for a large part of that and constantly trying to figure out the right mix of rules that would produce a presidential nominee who could not only win the White House, but governor effectively, win reelection and be successful generally, Putnam said.
Starting in the 1980s, however, that role of business statesmen began to fade. Executives came under increasing pressure to focus ruthlessly on boosting company profits and share prices. Those who didn't risked losing their jobs or seeing their companies swallowed up in hostile takeovers. Those who did were generously rewarded with bonuses and stock options. And while some chief executives were lionized on Wall Street and on magazine covers for restoring the competitiveness of U.S. industry, ordinary Americans began to associate them with plant closings, layoffs and extravagant pay.

The response from Trump fans: Wow, why so mad? TDS much?
No matter how queasy the president's impulsive Twitter feed makes Senate Republicans (thinking out loud with unverified facts is the diplomatic description one of them uses), McConnell's grip on his caucus is ironclad. In recent memory, he has lost only one significant vote: the dramatic thumbs-down rendered by John McCain (R-Ariz.) that killed Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. Honestly, I think McConnell was secretly happy with that one. Who wants to own the health-care mess?
The Democrats have treated us fairly, he said. I really believe that we've had a very good back-and-forth. And I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer.
Midway through Tuesday's hearing, Barr made clear he personally would support marijuana being illegal everywhere. But under questioning from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about states that have legalized it, he made a promise that will likely hearten those involved in selling and using the drug.
I mean, if [Democrats are] applauding, they shouldn't, because I can tell you that conversations over the last 48 hours are really about how we come together in the Republican Conference and try to get this over the finish line, he said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos.
This time, Senate Republicans will have to decide whether to tweak the House's version or throw it in the trash. And this estimate is only a fraction less politically damaging than the first one was.
His team was up on Capitol Hill last night to meet with Speaker Paul Ryan and his team. He continue to meet with Senate leaders and House leaders on how to do this. So we're continuing to formulate a plan and work with Congress, as he said on the campaign trail.
One morning not so long ago, Sarah Silverman needed some weed. So she drove to Hollywood and pulled into a parking space outside a dispensary.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also criticized the president's attacks:
NIGHT ONE: Wednesday night, 10 different candidates covered issues including Medicare-for-all, immigration, Iran, guns and the ideological direction of the party. Onstage were New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), former HUD secretary Julián Castro, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Maryland congressman John Delaney.
Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency — and Twitter — to usher his legislation to passage.
That's the kind of thing I'm not going to answer off the top of my head, but if we take it out of this context and say, if a prosecutor came and showed that there was a quid pro quo by which somebody gives something of value to induce a false testimony … Barr said.
Melania Trump has talked about the need to combat cyberbullying before and formalized those efforts as part of her 'Be Best' campaign, Mary writes. Her decision to address cyberbullying has drawn considerable attention because her husband flings insults and taunting tweets, and he has been blamed by many people for fanning a divisive online conversation.
Instead, if the state met certain conditions, insurance companies for one year could consider a person's health status when writing policies in the individual market. Another possible waiver would allow the state to replace a federal essential-benefits package with a more narrowly tailored package of benefits, limited to the individual and small-group markets.

Obama said he hoped his progressive movement would not be extinguished with Friday's transfer of power. This is not a period, he said. This is a comma in the continuing story of building America.

-- The European Union is also expected to announce tariffs today on $3.4 billion worth of U.S. products — from whiskey and motorcycles to peanuts and cranberries, the AP's Paul Wiseman reports.
In brief remarks, the President said he had approved a new executive order allowing the United States to 'immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests as well as close family members.' He said they would identify targets of those sanctions this week, CNN's Jennifer Hansler reports.
Trump met with representatives of the Saudi government:
And he noted that seniors' out-of-pocket costs have been rising under Part D plans. They've been facing large co-pays or coinsurance when buying drugs at the pharmacy counter, and then there's the donut hole where they lose drug coverage for a time after hitting a certain level of annual spending.
Proponents of increased aid for children say that it could help reduce child poverty, which is closely linked to a number of worse health outcomes.
The decision has the potential to impact vaccine distribution. Several houses of worship — including Catholic churches — currently serve as vaccination centers, as do many faith-affiliated organizations, Jack writes.
Even widespread dissatisfaction with government shutdowns does not necessarily translate into effective voter disciplining of politicians, they wrote.
In early December, the end of the pandemic glimmered on the horizon. Blockbuster vaccine results suggested a clear path forward, Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. Then the euphoria dissipated. The illusion — or, as one scientist puts it, the delusion — that science had bested the virus crumbled as mutation-ridden variants with concerning new characteristics were detected, she continues.
The Senate is heading toward an initial procedural vote on the relief bill.
But he welcomes liberals to the Federalist Society's jurisprudential worldview: There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. The fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.
— Democratic primary debate, Feb. 25
Some see a hopeful sign that voters, sick of the Washington-style polarization, are in the mood for bipartisanship. Others see a worrisome signal that Republican activists feel so burned — by Richmond and Washington — that they've thrown up their hands.

The poll also documented the impact of the pandemic on daily life, finding that more than a third of Americans say that they have struggled to pay living expenses since December.
After months of negotiations, a badly divided Roundtable — which had pushed for comprehensive health-care reform for two decades — declined to take a position on the legislation.
They point to language in his book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia, in which he opines that all human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the vice president when President Barack Obama secured his most important domestic achievement, issued a statement: This fall, Donald Trump will be trying to get the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare — ripping health insurance away from 30 million Americans, ending protections for 100 million more with preexisting conditions, destroying families, and costing a million jobs. I'll be fighting to end Donald Trump's administration.
AHH: Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff yesterday, after a months-long campaign and the most expensive House race in history. Staving off a major upset in Georgia's ruby-red 6th congressional district, Handel won with about 52 percent of the vote, retaining a seat that has belonged to a Republican since 1979 and becoming the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Georgia.
The argument: The elimination of the penalty made the mandate to purchase health insurance unconstitutional, and the entire law, including such popular provisions as keeping young adults on their parents's insurance policies and ensuring coverage for those with preexisting medical conditions, should fall.
Republican leaders have said that they will not strand people who gained insurance under the ACA without coverage. But it remains unclear from either Trump's comments in the interview or recent remarks by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill how they intend to accomplish that.
THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
Quite obviously, more people have health insurance than would otherwise have it, so you got to look at it as positive, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a recent interview.
— In a medical milestone, surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital transplanted a kidney from a living HIV-positive donor to an HIV-positive recipient. For the first time in a year, the recipient no longer needs kidney dialysis.
This is now real, she said. I would give a strong message to every member of Congress that you're going to hold the bag on this if you try to hide behind a vote. The consequences are real.
-- The ACLU launched a new campaign against Trump's policies. David Weigel reports from a Saturday training session in Coral Gables, Fla.: It had all the trappings of a campaign rally: the signs, the Bruce Springsteen songs on repeat, the clipboard-hugging volunteers in matching T-shirts. But the 2,000-odd people in the University of Miami's basketball arena were there to hear Anthony Romero, the executive director of the [ACLU], try to recruit them into a legal army. The ACLU is spending millions of dollars on a plunge into grass-roots politics — a 'People Power' campaign. It's the newest and largest development from a sprawling 'resistance' movement that regularly moves faster than the Democratic Party's leaders can think and isn't waiting on politicians for cues. The key to the effort: targeting Trump's policies, rather than the man or his words. If 2016 taught Democrats anything, it's that attacking Trump isn't enough. 'The biggest danger was in not doing something like this, where people get apathetic and they fall asleep,' [Romero said in an interview]. There's little apparent risk of that, and the biggest organizations on the left, broadly defined, are staffing up to give it direction.
BAIER: Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists' families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.
Insurers are particularly anxious to know whether the cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income people to afford their out-of-pocket costs, which House Republicans have challenged in court as illegal, will continue. According to the Congressional Budget Office, those federal payments will total $7 billion this year and $10 billion in 2018.
-- It also does not mean that Republican leaders will fail. Trump has political capital, and he's willing to spend it. Ryan (R-Wis.) believes that this fight will define his legacy as House speaker. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recognizes that a promise has been made to the conservative base over the past four election cycles, and he fears the fallout of breaking it. The Senate majority leader is up for reelection in 2020 and could face a primary challenge.
I have had a lot of experience. I've sat on the corporate boards of health-care companies. I've run hospitals and big health-care systems and I've obviously been secretary, but my best experience has been talking to people and seeing what's bothering them. Out-of-pocket costs, I think, are a big issue with people. We've got to figure out a way to get our arms around that issue. These are bread- and-butter issues, but they're also issues for companies because the companies are going crazy because they don't know what their health-care costs are going to be next year. So there are a lot of interests in containing costs.
Trump, who has spent recent weeks meeting with executives from the health-care industry, has struggled with the issue since Republicans in 2017 failed to repeal the ACA, falling short on a repeated campaign promise. Instead, the effort boosted the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and Democrats notched major victories in the 2018 midterms by criticizing the GOP on health care.

No, nor have I met any American that has, McCain said when asked if he'd seen the Senate health-care plan. I'm sure the Russians have been able to hack in and have gotten most of it.
Biden said he would act — even if Republicans in Congress wouldn't go along — to add 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations around the country and to fund billions in scientific research. Biden also returned to a theme of the evening for him, that he had dealmaking experience that other candidates lack. In this case, Biden said he wanted to return the United States to the Paris Climate Accord, a global emissions-reduction plan that Trump has said he's pulling the United States out of. And Biden said, he would then press other nations to increase their goals to reduce emissions.

In a matter of days, Democrats circled their wagons and geared up for a fight to defend what they consider the most important piece of domestic policy legislation of this century — a law they successfully defended on Capitol Hill two years ago that propelled them into a midterm election landslide and the House majority in November.
Matthew McCoy, a University of Pennsylvania medical ethics and health policy assistant professor, told the Kaiser reporters that even though there are circumstances in which what's best for patients is the same as what's best for drugmakers, people should consider patient advocacy group statements with a 'skeptical eye' if groups have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
Indeed, liberals in recent days have chosen not to fight Pelosi on a number of battles. While the congressional Progressive Caucus last week sank a leadership-backed budget bill, its passage was not critical, allowing the left to send a warning to leadership without burning bridges or scuttling a must-pass bill.
Lee and Harvard Medical School associate professor of psychiatry Leonard L. Glass penned an article for Politico Magazine this week arguing it is their duty to question Trump's mental fitness as psychiatrists: Without diagnosing Trump in a specific way, as the Goldwater rule prohibits, it is not only acceptable but vitally necessary to have a public conversation about mental state of our nation's leader ... Any president's mental health is inextricably tied to our health as a society, and, in this case, Trump's mental state poses a serious danger that we must be willing to discuss and address.
Aware of criticism that any cap on Medicaid funding would target vulnerable patients, Verma will stress during Thursday's announcement that her plan, by focusing just on the Obamacare expansion, will not affect the poorest or disabled patients, Dan and Rachel write. Verma has long argued Medicaid expansion is siphoning away resources from the most vulnerable patients covered by the program. CMS will frame the block grant as a way for states to reinvest any savings into care improvements for Medicaid beneficiaries.
Then he goes, we have five. And -- well, excuse me, I won 10. I won 10 states. If you listen to him, it's like -- I won 10 states. Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner. There wasn't one person that didn't say that. Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job. So how does he take -- how does he take five and say it's better than 10?
I honor the First Amendment, I believe in the First Amendment, she said. With all rights come serious responsibilities. Civil discourse is one of those responsibilities, especially for educators. We are models.
Both the House and Senate bills aim to set a per-person cap on Medicaid spending in each state. That cap would adjust annually to take into account inflation. Through 2025, both bills would adjust the cap based on a measure of how rapidly medical costs are expanding — a measure known as the CPI-M.
Diaper need can have significant health implications, because keeping babies and toddlers in diapers too long — or washing and reusing disposable ones — can lead to painful rashes, urinary tract infections and emergency room trips. A Yale University study found that it is a major indicator of maternal stress and depression, which can affect a child's development and increase the likelihood of multigenerational poverty, she writes.
Of the first five questions to Sen. John Thune (S.D.) and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers (Wash.), four involved reactions to Trump controversies. Thune called the issue of using torture settled law despite the draft executive order to review those tactics.
Paul is hardly the first GOP holdout to cave to the Trump administration for a pittance in return. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for one, voted for the GOP's tax bill in December after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pledged to pass a bill shoring up Obamacare exchanges. And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) voted for that bill after McConnell and the White House pledged to negotiate on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Neither promise has been kept.
I feel rotten, and I feel tired, Carney said at the time. And I feel that mistakes are made constantly when people are tired. And I feel rotten about it, but I take responsibility for my vote.
But the crowd that spilled onto the Mall gave the proceedings a distinctly Trumpian flavor. There were jeers when Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was called upon to speak, and when Trump stepped forward to take the oath, people chanted, Trump! Trump! Trump!
No, he's not right, Kasich replied. First of all, Medicaid expansion has covered 700,000 people in my state, a big chunk of whom are mentally ill and drug addicted and have chronic diseases. … If chronically ill, you're going to have to have consistent coverage. Under this bill you don't have it.
In contrast to the administration that has tried to discourage ACA exchange sign-ups, the Democrats' bill would restore marketing funding for health care sold through the marketplace, which the Trump administration has cut by 90 percent since taking office . . . [and] for health navigator groups that help people sign up for comprehensive care, which has been cut by 77 percent since the President Trump took office.

Rotterman said that there still could be a course correction but that if Trump and Republicans don't make good on their promises, they risk losing support — particularly from the blue-collar voters who helped propel Trump to victory last fall. They're counting on him, Rotterman said.

I think it was so early people didn't know who he was and he wasn't defined as doing any kind of flip-flopping, said Chris Jennings, a longtime Democratic adviser and health-policy expert. He was able to tell people what his policy was before people could frame it differently.
Trump previously backed the idea of importing drugs from Canada, but his top health appointees have been critical of the practice, Rachana notes. On Monday, HHS Secretary Azar said any process to import drugs from other countries is a gimmick. The United States has the safest regulatory system in the world. The last thing we need is open borders for unsafe drugs in search of savings that cannot be safely achieved, Azar said.
An FDA spokeswoman confirmed the agency had received Braeburn's petition but declined to comment publicly on the matter. She directed Health 202 to previous statements in which the agency promised to promote medication-assisted treatment by issuing guidance for developing it, encouraging its use through policy changes and working to reduce stigma associated with such treatments.

Stettin insisted the company's announcement isn't tied to recent scrutiny by lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have been holding hearings in the House and Senate on drug prices, and have specifically fixated on insulin prices.

Several Democratic strategists involved in presidential politics say they worry Democratic primary voters have been radicalized by anger at Trump's controversial and racially insensitive approach to immigration. That was a mistake many in the party concluded occurred in 2016, when Clinton ceded the security aspect of immigration to Trump in an effort to increase enthusiasm among younger and nonwhite voters. At one forum in 2015, she promised to be a much less harsh and aggressive enforcer than Obama, who had been criticized by Hispanic groups as too punitive.
If we persist on following GDP, we're going to follow it off a cliff because things like artificial intelligence and self-driving trucks will be tremendous for both GDP and corporate profits, and they will be very problematic, even disastrous for many, many Americans. If you can imagine a business or organization that is following the wrong measurements, that is the United States of America right now. Human-centered capitalism actually shows us how we are doing, and then we'll put our country's energies towards improving our lives rather than the bottom lines of a smaller and smaller handful of companies.
-- This doesn't look good: While serving as a top campaign aide to [Trump], Michael Flynn made tens of thousands of dollars on the side advising a company that sold surveillance technology that repressive governments used to monitor activists and journalists, HuffPost's Paul Blumenthal and Jessica Schulberg report: [Flynn] earned nearly $1.5 million last year as a consultant, adviser, board member, or speaker for more than three dozen companies and individuals … Two of those entities are directly linked to NSO Group, a secretive Israeli cyberweapons dealer founded by Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, who are rumored to have served in Unit 8200, the Israeli equivalent of the National Security Agency. [And] during the time Flynn was working for NSO's Luxembourg affiliate, one of the company's main products — a spy software sold exclusively to governments and marketed as a tool for law enforcement officials to monitor suspected criminals and terrorists — was being used to surveil political dissidents, reporters, activists, and government officials.

Lamb, 33, had waged an energetic campaign in the district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points in 2016 but that opened up after the Republican incumbent was felled by scandal. Republicans cited that scandal, along with the lackluster campaign of their nominee, Rick Saccone, to minimize the closeness of the race. The district itself will disappear this year, thanks to a court decision that struck down a Republican-drawn map.
In an appearance on Face the Nation, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) also endorsed repealing Obamacare with a delayed implementation that would give lawmakers time to craft a replacement, noting that approach might be easier.

Most One America employees were young and inexperienced. They worked hard for low pay. Four OAN writers and producers said they were paid as little as $12 an hour, or $25,000 a year, and three anchors said they were paid as little as $52,000, well below the scale at national networks, though more in line with what's paid at local TV news operations in smaller markets.
For one thing, the co-ops had to accept any marketplace customers, meaning they had less control over the makeup of their risk pool. If sicker, more expensive consumers bought in, too bad for the co-ops. Association health plans can limit their enrollment to association members — farmers and ranchers in this case – so it could be easier for them to anticipate the costs of coverage.
The FDA has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, our Post colleagues Laurie McGinley and Joel Achenbach report, noting the agency oversees 80 percent of the food supply. The FDA is continuing to conduct inspections of foreign manufacturers, imports and domestic producers involved in recalls or outbreaks.
And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.
RUBIO: Well, first of all, government doesn't...
But Congress can address these inequalities in its next covid-19 bill as well as close coverage gaps that put everyone, even those with insurance, at risk. A big gap is the danger that those who are treated for covid-19 — even with insurance — will be asked to make potentially bankrupting cost-sharing payments (the part one covers that the insurer does not — co-pays, coinsurance and deductibles) or receive surprise bills from out-of-network providers that are unpaid by insurance.
There's plenty to criticize about PBMs, to be sure. While they obtain rebates from drugmakers to ultimately lower drug spending – a worthy goal – there's incentive for them to favor the most expensive drugs when creating the list of drugs covered by an insurance plan. That's because they're allowed to keep a share of the rebate, which is based on a drug's list price.
We won the House through the middle, said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), who co-leads the Problem Solvers Caucus. Our party has to be open and recognize that. And if we don't and insist that everyone takes a hard line view on everything, (a) I don't think that's going to attract votes in the next election, and (b) it puts our majority at risk.

I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can't find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?
Planned Parenthood chief executive Cecile Richards, speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, said she took Ryan's threat very seriously and said her organization had already launched a major national campaign to mobilize supporters.
— Meanwhile, health officials in the city issued summonses to the parents of three children in separate households last week because they did not vaccinate their children against measles, even after the city's emergency order requiring immunizations.
The official pointed to findings that local news outlets enjoy greater trust from the public than their national counterparts and provide a venue to highlight local impacts the legislation could have.
Of those [allegedly illegal] votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. … They all voted for Hillary.
Senate Democrats are facing increasing pressure to end or modify the filibuster from their more liberal members, the more progressive wing of the House and outside activist groups. As all 50 Republicans lined up against Biden's $1.9 trillion covid relief plan, some more moderate Democrats, including Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, signed on to the idea. But in order to alter the rules, all 50 Democrats in the chamber would have to vote in favor, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the resulting tie. At least two centrist Democrats -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- have said they won't go along. Manchin says the filibuster should be made more painful to use by requiring senators who invoke it to speak continuously.
Post-1980, the Hunt Commission was created to overhaul the entire nominating process, including the creation of superdelegates in 1982. Two years later, they were a part of the campaign and have been ever since.
And comments are due today on draft rules announced in February by Department of Health and Human Services head Alex Azar, taking sharp aim at the discounts obtained by PBMs. The rules, which HHS aims to finalize in June, would ban the rebates PBMs are paid by drug manufacturers in Medicare plans and Medicaid managed-care plans — savings that aren't always passed along to consumers. The rules are among a bucket of changes proposed by the Trump administration as part of its promise to lower drug prices.
Biden's promised union members he'd be the strongest labor president you've ever had. While serving as vice president, he got out ahead of President Barack Obama in publicly supporting same-sex marriage.
-- Bernie Sanders asked his supporters to cool it – but they don't always listen. Sean Sullivan reports: Campaign officials have been pressing surrogates and other allies not to escalate combustible disputes that have recently become more personal, ... including a tense fight with Joe Biden, a separate altercation with [Elizabeth Warren] and a renewed schism with Hillary Clinton. … But many Sanders supporters, and even some campaign aides, are inclined to take a more aggressive approach that they say will highlight important differences. … Some close Sanders allies acknowledged the difficulty of balancing the passions of his loyal backers, inspired by his calls for a political revolution and his staunchly liberal platform, with the need to demonstrate a broader unity.
Our focus is on the violence. We don't care what ideology motivates somebody, he said. We don't care whether it's left, right, up, down, diagonal or any other way. If the ideology is motivating violence and it violates federal law we're coming after it.
According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.
You can tell if [a patient] is trending individually in the right direction or not based upon different parameters that we monitor behind the scenes, Helton said. And then we know when to intervene. We can call the site and say, 'We think you need to go to Room 12, this patient is not doing well — or he's about to not do well — and this how we think you should intervene.' 
But the governor also told reporters that everything is on the table.
TRUMP: I have nothing to say. I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said. I would have certainly have rather left it to the states. I was always in favor -- I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.
The California Republican's remarks represent a vindication of Democratic efforts to elevate health care as an issue in last year's campaign, Mike adds.
Republicans want to cut corporate tax rates nearly in half — but can't identify even a single corporate tax loophole they would close to prevent the deficit from ballooning out of control.
He impersonated several characters from The Simpsons in a Buzzfeed video in June, seemingly trying to connect with younger voters. Most notably, he attempted Mr. Burns's infamous excellent, complete with hand motions.
-- What makes these two polls especially striking is that they were both in the field several days before the national furor over Trump's separation policy reached a fever pitch. The Pew survey was conducted June 5-12. The Gallup poll was conducted June 1-13.
1. Who controls a 50-50 Senate?
She also said that an increasingly anti-immigrant climate has made many immigrants afraid to sign up their children for public programs such as Medicaid and CHIP, and that Texas has cut programs intended to help people enroll in health insurance.
Here's another strange irony of the shutdown for the Trump administration: It's putting a damper on the IRS's ability to review applications from states to run their marketplace in alternative ways — a big way the administration is seeking to put a more conservative stamp on Obamacare.
-- A lack of a black box could hinder the NTSB investigation into Kobe Bryant's helicopter crash. Ian Duncan and Luz Lazo report: While airliners and some other aircraft are required to have the recorders, which can gather technical data as well as audio and video recordings, many helicopters are not. The Federal Aviation Administration says it's difficult to make the economic case for requiring the devices because they don't prevent crashes. … NTSB investigators continued their work Tuesday, sifting through the crash wreckage, trying to understand what happened and beginning interviews with witnesses. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner said it had recovered all nine bodies from the crash scene, three of which had been recovered Sunday afternoon. Four of the people on board, including Bryant, were formally identified by fingerprints.
A few hours later, Thune was asked whether the president's remarks were distracting the effort to coordinate a unified message with his fellow Republicans.
Activists on both sides of the issue are nervously eyeing newly minted Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was fiercely opposed by abortion rights advocates during his confirmation hearings last fall under the assumption that he'd tilt the court in a more antiabortion direction and perhaps even open the door to reversing Roe v. Wade.
Conservative Republicans were elated with the shutdown, write Casas and Wilkerson, seeing it as their best opportunity to defund the Affordable Care Act.
AHH: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she was disappointed the president did not discuss the gun violence epidemic in his speech, even as he listed threats against the country.
So things could still get very ugly. But it's intriguing that top Trump advisers see political danger in going too hard after the Affordable Care Act. And they face another problem, too. But that brings us to our next item.
Trump hadn't exceeded her low expectations.
The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is preparing to notify states of the newly available grant flexibility, Ricardo writes. Ultimately, state officials want Congress to consider folding the opioid money into a larger block grant program administered by the same agency, creating a big pool of federal money to treat addiction, with fewer restrictions on its use.
Andrew Yang: She's right. And what's happened to adjunct professors is morally bankrupt. You have these universities that have figured out that they have this pool of labor that they can systematically exploit. In the old days, they would feel like they had to put someone on a tenure track in order to teach for the long term. But now they've figured out that there's an oversupply of PhDs and they can get away with pushing them around. I am for the rights to organize among these adjunct professors. I know some of them have pushed for it. We need to see that they are treated better. But I want to speak to what that is emblematic of.
I would say that this proves that the 'deranged' were the ones who were seeing things clearly, he said. If anyone has become deranged by Trump, it's the people who can't stop supporting him.
With Warren (D-Mass.) out, the only other major candidate left is Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). She earned a delegate from American Samoa on Tuesday, but Democratic National Committee officials signaled that they will raise the threshold to qualify for the Phoenix debate so that this is no longer sufficient to get onstage.
— Cigna and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, two Obamacare insurers in Virginia, have proposed major premium hikes for 2019. In filings on Friday, the companies cited policies by the Trump administration and Congress's decision to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate as some of the reasons for the hikes, The Hill's Nathaniel Weixel reports.
As a U.S. Senator and Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John McCain was among the Senate's staunchest supporters of our men and women in uniform, the document says. It argues that McCain fought to make sure America kept its promise to its veterans.
The president is going to have a choice: to reach out to moderate Democrats and work in a bipartisan fashion; or to reach out to recalcitrant Republicans in his own party that he wasn't able to get this time, Steel said.
Much of the serious policy work has been conducted behind the scenes by a small group of health-policy staffers, with members of McConnell's inner circle leading the political strategy, according to top GOP aides familiar with the negotiations. Experts have been working to craft a number of policy options that lawmakers can mix and match to create a final policy outline.
— A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found less than half of people in America are aware of HIV treatments and their effectiveness.
Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), the most powerful Republican on Capitol Hill, seemed convinced that there is nothing damaging in the report.
So why is the ACA still politically vulnerable?
His slogan is make America great again, and I feel like everybody is kind of, like, connected now, he said. Everybody's all against Trump. People are more united because everybody just doesn't like the president right now.
On Wednesday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted that the agency is fully committed to reducing tobacco-related disease and death and mentioned that he met with the U.S. surgeon general to discuss e-cigarette-related risks.
The tax code is a powerful tool, but it only works insofar as you have really good participation in the tax system, said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. Tax credits are likely to miss people who don't file individual income taxes, and so they will miss many low-income households.
Do you want me to talk about the pay-for?
The research found 18 percent of e-cigarette users stopped smoking after a year, compared with 9.9 percent of those using nicotine-replacement products like lozenges or patches, The Post's Laurie McGInley reports. The participants in the study also received behavioral support to stop smoking.
Vox has collected more than 1,300 ER bills from readers, finding such surprise medical bills are quite common in emergency rooms. The dominant storyline to emerge is what anyone who has visited an emergency room might expect: Treatment is expensive. Fees have risen sharply in the past decade. And when health insurance plans don't pay, patients are left with burdensome bills, Sarah writes.
-- The Capitals lost to the Ducks, 5-2.
But Hanger objects to using savings on anything other than health care. And Wagner wants to use about half of the savings on raises and the like, and the other half for his proposed $250-a-year tax credit.
Those contrasting experiences of the past two Democratic presidents suggest that Biden is smart to pursue more than one path to getting a package that would provide economic relief to those who have been hardest hit by the covid-19 pandemic, and more resources to immunize Americans against it.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: Mitch McConnell criticized Trump's tariffs while attending an event in his home state of Kentucky. I'm not a fan of tariffs, and I am nervous about what appears to be a growing trend in the administration to levy tariffs, the Senate majority leader said. This is a slippery slope, so my hope is that this will stop before it gets into a broader tit-for-tat that can't be good for our country. (Louisville Courier Journal)
Nonetheless, we decided to see if voters in Clinton country stood by their candidate one year into Trump's tenure. We know Trump's supporters are sticking with him, but are Clinton's sticking with her? Is Trump convincing any opponents to rally to his cause?
Expect an opposite narrative tomorrow, when executives for the country's top three PBMs — CVS Health, UnitedHealth's OptumRx and Cigna's Express Scripts — will sit before the Finance Committee for its latest hearing on the high cost of prescription drugs. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.) have made drug costs a top priority this year, stirring widespread hope Congress will find a bipartisan way to get at the problem.
Advocates said they considered proposing a state insurance mandate but decided to push for a down-payment system instead, hoping to avoid the type of conflict that surrounded the federal requirement enacted under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.
Meaning there's still a chance the nomination battle drags on through the Democratic convention in Milwaukee this summer, resulting in a rare contested convention that hasn't occurred for either major party in almost 70 years.
Here is what the numbers also say. Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you. They do not want you to be our nominee.
LePoulin was the first person I spoke with who regretted his vote for Clinton — but Trump had not earned his vote.
Rector, an architect of the 1996 federal welfare overhaul under President Bill Clinton that instituted work requirements, generally opposes safety net measures that do not promote work and marriage. But he would like to see more-generous benefits for individuals and cities in crisis in response to the coronavirus — for a finite period of time.
A GoFundMe spokesman said in a statement to the Daily Beast that the company is conducting a thorough review and will remove any campaigns currently on the platform. So far, he said the site has found fewer than 10 to take down.
-- Paul Ryan is expected in a speech today to talk up the possibility of overhauling the tax code this year, despite many obstacles. The Wall Street Journal's Richard Rubin reports: Mr. Ryan, in a speech to manufacturers in Washington, isn't expected to delve into the details that divide Republicans or the negotiations between the Trump administration and members of Congress … Mr. Ryan's speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, sandwiched between cable news appearances, is meant to build momentum and public support for the party's aims. Republicans face significant obstacles, but many see a tax overhaul as a political necessity that would deliver on one of their core campaign promises. For now, taxes are secondary to health care and other policy issues. But the GOP is planning a busy fall.
This is unwelcome news for many Virginia consumers. Anthem HealthKeepers currently covers approximately 206,000 people in Virginia's individual health insurance market, Virginia Insurance Commissioner Jacqueline K. Cunningham said in a statement. The departure will leave five insurers in the state's marketplace for next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A dramatic example of the contemporary court's attitude toward the poor came in 2012, when it narrowly upheld most of the Affordable Care Act. That part of the opinion marked a victory for people who could not afford health insurance. Yet in the same ruling, the court limited the law's Medicaid expansion, on unconvincing constitutional grounds that it involved coercion of states by the federal government. That decision effectively took Medicaid away from millions of the poorest Americans (given that 14 states still have declined to expand the program). One study estimated that more than 15,000 deaths could have been avoided over four years if all states had expanded Medicaid.
Rosenstein could, if he chose, issue a redacted report that conveys the gist of Mueller's findings. Of course, given the president's apparent displeasure with Rosenstein, it's possible that by then Trump will have replaced the deputy attorney general with a more compliant successor who would not affirmatively disclose the report. Or Trump could achieve the same result by replacing [Jeff] Sessions with a new attorney general who isn't recused from supervising Mueller.
Biden has even more history with Thomas, who was confirmed when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas's nomination was disrupted by allegations of sexual harassment leveled by Anita Hill, who previously had worked in government jobs with Thomas.
Duckworth also opened up to Sweet about her struggles to conceive again. I've had multiple IVF cycles and a miscarriage trying to conceive again, so we're very grateful, she said.
If after all of the talk, after all of the chest-thumping, we can't get anything done, we may get clubbed like baby seals in 2018, said Stipanovich, who was an early Trump critic.
Against the advice of many congressional Republicans, White House advisers are also working to craft an Obamacare replacement plan that Trump could campaign on, especially if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit should declare the law unconstitutional this fall and catapult the issue to the forefront of the 2020 races.
Their fear is that Trump would get the United States into trade wars with Mexico and China and a real war in the Middle East, while initiating mass deportations of illegal immigrants that would disrupt labor markets and lead to social unrest.
I think that there are some things that he will do on Friday. There are executive actions. He may swear-in some members of the Cabinet that have been -- if and when they are confirmed by the Senate. But there's a lot of things that he's going to get right to action on.
Biggest news to me here is that Mueller is writing an obstruction report, added Matthew Miller, a Justice Department spokesman during Barack Obama's administration. I'm not sure POTUS can actually be a target if Mueller doesn't believe a sitting president can be indicted.
All of it, gone, Trump says. After we're done, you'll never have to drive to see a doctor again, how's that sound?
Americans also appear uncertain about giving U.S. veterans more access to private medical care. Thirty-nine percent of likely voters feel privatizing VA would be bad for veterans, while just one-third say it would good to do so, according to a Rasmussen poll released yesterday. Smaller shares of respondents said either privatization would have no impact or weren't sure whether it would.
For better or worse, most African Americans support Obamacare: In January, the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found 82 percent of African American respondents had a favorable view of Obamacare — the most contentious domestic issue during the last Democratic administration.
Well, in Washington, apparently a fiscal hawk who's famous for warning that we've got to tackle our alleged debt crisis before it tackles us. That, after all, is how House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who just announced his retirement, has most often been described. Pay no attention to the tax cut in front of the curtain — his real passion is attacking red ink with the earnestness of someone who thinks the words budget baseline are exciting. It must be true! He has said so himself!
-- A panel of judges ruled that a defamation lawsuit, alleging Trump sexually assaulted a former Apprentice contestant more than a decade ago, can be heard by New York's highest state court. Joshua Partlow reports: The decision by an appellate division of the New York Supreme Court granted Trump's legal team's request to have the case heard by the New York Court of Appeals. Trump's team has argued that he should not be subject to actions in state courts while he is in the White House. Trump had been scheduled to give a deposition by Jan. 31, but that is now on hold. A statement from the firm of Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said, 'we are pleased' about the decision. The defamation lawsuit was brought by Summer Zervos. … Her case has been moving slowly through the New York courts and could potentially be decided before the 2020 election.
-- The Green New Deal is so aspirational that it invites attacks, David Weigel writes. In an accompanying FAQ, the authors write that they can't get to zero emissions in 10 years (the horizon of all legislation) because 'we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.' That was meant to be wry; within minutes it was being attacked as proof that the deal's endorsers literally wanted to ban planes, and perhaps cows. But that language grew out of a movement that calls for a transition to 100 percent renewable energy in the next 12 years, with a World War II-level mobilization of resources.
Toward that end, he's been launching field offices and flooding the airwaves and the Internet with ads entirely funded by his own vast wealth. His campaign told NBC News yesterday that it now has organizers and staff in more than 30 states, including all 14 of the crucial states with primaries on Super Tuesday.
The people in Florida wouldn't elect him dogcatcher. He couldn't get any -- he's right now 21 points down to me. And, you know...
I was having a little deja vu the last couple of weeks, I got to be honest with you. I don't know exactly what's going on in their backrooms. Turnout for us was great, he said. The party all came together and we elected — I think they're in a much tougher spot. But I get that deja vu. I think things might be a little bit rigged against him.
And while states could decide to restrict enrollment, they couldn't slash the benefits Medicaid plans cover. Plans will still have to comply with the ACA's requirements to cover 10 services deemed essential, such as maternity and emergency-room care.
Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.
Trump lashed out at Bolton on Twitter this morning as he pleaded with Republicans not to go along with calling witnesses who could testify against him:
That wall made for a great campaign chant. But getting it done has been much more complicated. So complicated, in fact, that the president shut down a quarter of the federal government. He says he'll leave 800,000 workers without paychecks until Congress agrees to appropriate money from U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico, for the wall's construction.
He's like a CEO rather than a traditional president, Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), a Trump supporter, said in an interview. It's somewhat more detached, sure. What he wants to do is set the target and let others figure it out.
Democrats aren't likely to garner any GOP support for these ideas, so they'd have to try using a budget reconciliation bill requiring 50 Senate votes (with Vice President Harris breaking the tie). And Congress can pass only one budget reconciliation bill a year. Democrats are already using up this year's bill by focusing on coronavirus relief. It's unclear exactly how they plan to use next year's budget reconciliation bill.
I'm from Brooklyn; we speak in strong language, he said. I shouldn't have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I never — never — would do such a thing.
This was in large part why Democrats successfully ran in 2018 on bread-and-butter issues including health care. Returning to a traditional Democratic economic record, they can remind even previously devoted Trump followers that the president has betrayed their interests.
Without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable, Paxton said in a statement. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court.
It's a stupid talking point designed to deflect attention away from what he did, former deputy solicitor general Neal Katyal said.
… The primary is April 30 in the district that includes parts or all of 17 counties in Eastern North Carolina.
4. What can Democrats do with 50 Senate votes?
The secretary, testifying before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that several drug manufacturers wanted to lower prices, but were facing challenges. Azar said those companies feared pharmacy benefit managers would discriminate against them by dropping them from the lists of medicines covered by an insurer.
This story, originally posted on May 6, 2017, has been updated.
-- Biden's advisers were bracing for another dismal result, with some inside his campaign saying he could finish as low as fifth, and with some early warning signs that his national polling lead — one that he pointed to just two days earlier as validation — has collapsed, Matt Viser and Sean Sullivan report. Much as he tried to hurry past his low finish in Iowa, Biden on Monday sought to push beyond New Hampshire even before the vote. His campaign announced that its co-chairman, Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), will host a 'launch party' in South Carolina on Tuesday night at around the same time polls will be closing in New Hampshire. Biden is planning to travel to South Carolina, where he has been leading in polls ahead of the Feb. 29 vote, before heading to Nevada, which holds its caucuses Feb. 22.
The administration's rule means federally funded family planning clinics can no longer refer patients for abortions and have to maintain a clear physical and financial separation between abortion services and services funded by the government.
Gene Sperling , a Clinton and Obama economic official, and Ann O'Leary , a former top Hillary Clinton adviser. Biden, however, is still working through the process of picking a replacement for Tanden, CNN reports . White House officials are quietly considering other replacements, including, a Clinton and Obama economic official, and, a former top Hillary Clinton adviser.
Deterioration in the rule of law. Reckless fiscal policy and lack of public investment. Failure to fix a costly and underperforming health-care system or address the challenges of globalization and climate change. Like the impeachment process now playing out at the Capitol, each is both a consequence of and contributor to our broken politics. And like the impeachment process, each will have negative long-term impact on the quality of our institutions and the vibrancy of our economy.
Soon after Trump was elected, favorable opinion of the ACA grew.
Asked whether he agreed that the new coronavirus would be gone by April, Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, told Congress he did not. Prudent to assume this pathogen will be with us for some time to come, he said.

These immigration numbers must be viewed against the backdrop of other issues. Republicans have opened a nine-point advantage on which party is best to deal with the economy (45 percent to 36 percent). Last October, Democrats had a three-point edge (41 percent to 38 percent). Typically to win elections, you play to your biggest strengths. Trump has not chosen to take this approach:
And Andy Slavitt, who headed CMS under President Obama
The changes proposed in the rule are targeted to further the goals of lowering premiums, enhancing the consumer experience, increasing market stability, and reducing regulatory burdens, CMS wrote. Other proposals in the 331-page notice include:
Lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. On April 26, 2017, Trump unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. But the conference report on the tax bill approved by House and Senate negotiators made the rate 21 percent. That's still a big cut, but less than what Trump had promised.
Trump has also frequently attacked judges who make rulings he disagrees with, even calling them Obama judges. Gorsuch rebuked Trump during his nomination over Trump's attacks on judges. Roberts too has seen fit to rebuke Trump for this — which is worth emphasizing, given that Schumer's office criticized him for not doing it last week.
In an interview near his motel, Yang said there was no special process for brainstorming these ideas. He is happy to point out that the universal basic income concept has been around for decades and nearly became law in the 1970s. The problems are obvious, the solutions are out there, but people with more traditional political minds have just been too hidebound to talk about them.
McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is pushing legislation, modeled on a bill introduced days after the August 2019 mass shooting in El Paso. That's when a 21-year-old White man allegedly drove more than 11 hours through Texas to go on a rampage at a Walmart, killing 22 people and leaving 26 more injured in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.
Catalyst says the $375,000 price for Firdapse, used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), is comparable to similar products, Reuters's Manas Mishra reports.
Of course, Republicans pounced on the Medicare spending reductions in Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act. For a while, Medicare cuts were one of their top attack lines against the health-care law. More recently, they've been charging the Medicare-for-all plans advanced by progressive Democrats would destroy the current Medicare program for seniors, a claim my colleague Colby Itkowitz examined in this Health 202.
OUCH: The AP's Sadie Gurman offers a fascinating report on how the Justice Department is making available reams of new data available to help sniff out the nation's top opioid prescribers. The October indictment of top opioid prescriber Andrzej Zielke was the first by a nationwide group of federal law enforcement officials that, armed with new access to a broader array of prescription drug databases, Medicaid and Medicare figures, coroners' records and other DOJ data, aims to stop fraudulent doctors faster, Sadie writes.
At one point during the campaign, Ryan denounced or disagreed with something Trump said roughly once a week.
I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press, and that applies to you, unfortunately, Chelsea told the dejected fourth-grader.
BIDEN: The ideas I have, Chuck, are big and bold. I mean this idea that I'm not the progressive in the race. I mean my lord, if, if I get elected president of the United States with my position on health care, my position on global warming, my position on foreign policy, my position on the middle class, this will go down as one of the most progressive administrations in American history. But what we're — what you're up against is things that are almost fanciful. Like, you know, Medicare-for-all. Thirty-five, 30, 40 trillion dollars. Even Bernie's now saying, 'Well, how much is it going to cost?' Well, who knows. We'll find out.' I think that's the phrase he used — or 'we don't know.' I mean, part of being president is not just the idea you have. Can you get it done? Have you ever done anything big? Have you ever been able to put together coalitions that bring along Republicans and all the Democrats to get things done? And the idea, I mean it's almost fanciful sometimes.
Implement the Penny Plan, which each year would reduce net spending by 1 percent of the previous year's total. Over 10 years, Trump says, this would reduce spending by almost $1 trillion. Defense and public safety spending would be exempt. (See above.)
President Trump said he may declare a national emergency to get funding for his border wall depending on how negotiations develop:
I'm old enough to remember a few weeks ago when talking about a united House Democratic conference was all the rage, joked National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack, passing the Politico story on to reporters.
According to the federal government, Ryan earned too much money on unemployment. It was more money than she would have made working as a preschool teacher, and it bumped her into a different income bracket that reduced her Affordable Care Act insurance subsidy. She's desperate to keep health insurance in the middle of the pandemic and is trying to figure out how to pay the hefty bill.
In no way has he tried to bring people together, she said. In any way. In fact, I think his power comes from keeping people mad at each other.
Shalala: Absolutely. The principle is universal health care. Medicare-for-all is one way to get there. My preference is to be very pragmatic and fill in the gaps.
-- Also forced to resign was Channing D. Phillips, who has been the U.S. attorney for D.C. It is unclear who his replacement will be, and the field of possible candidates is not limited to District residents – giving the Trump administration a wide pool to choose from. (Colbert I. King)
It should be the golden era for the marketplaces, which have showed signs of stabilizing in recent years after an initially tough rollout under the Obama administration. Yet they're not exactly flourishing, as they attract fewer new customers and signups on Healthcare.gov creep downward.
Surgeons have transplanted 116 organs from deceased HIV-positive donors to recipients with HIV since 2016, when a new law allowing that surgery took effect, our colleague writes. Among people without HIV, more than 152,000 kidneys from living donors have been transplanted over the past 30 years, and a few hundred livers from live donors are implanted each year.
-- Aghdam's family said they told the police their daughter was missing and warned the authorities about her anger at YouTube. ABC10 News's Anthony Pura and Marie Estrada report: [Her brother] said his family began worrying about Nasim over the weekend. She was staying at her grandmother's home in 4-S Ranch, but she stopped answering her phone — and they reported her missing to police. Their concerns grew worse when police told them that her car was found in Mountain View. 'I googled mountain view and it was close to Youtube headquarters. And she had a problem with Youtube,' her brother said. 'So I called that cop again and told him there's a reason she went all the way from San Diego to there, so she might do something.' He says police told the family they would keep an eye on her … but 12 hours later, the shooting happened.
Yet the association health plans are subject to the same requirements as the health plans provided to employers of large companies, and there's some initial evidence that Democrats' dire predictions of their effects aren't playing out. It's likely the Department of Labor, which put forward the new regulations, will appeal the decision. But if the ruling went into effect immediately, thousands of people could lose their health plans.
GOP House members who returned to Washington on Monday split on whether the bill had any near-term prospects.
Large portions of the Republican Party are radicalizing and threatening American democracy, McMullin told Reid. The party needs to recommit to truth, reason and founding ideals or there clearly needs to be something new.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has frequently emphasized his support for Medicare-for-all in his presidential campaign, but Tuesday he sought to defend Obamacare from the Trump administration.
I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.
Just look at Cremona, Italy to see the pandemic's toll on the elderly.
* GOP GOVERNORS BLAST TRUMP BUDGET: The New York Times reports that GOP governors are opposing the Trump budget's elimination of funding for agencies that fund development in Appalachia and the Delta region, which are Trump-backing regions. As one tax expert notes:
AHH: Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays for critical inpatient hospital services for seniors, is expected to run out of money by 2026. The trust fund, which pays for things like services and hospice care for Medicare beneficiaries, will have the revenue to pay for just 89 percent of costs by 2026, our Post colleague Jeff Stein reports, following the release of a report from the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees. The report also found Medicare costs are set to spike in the next several decades, increasing from 3.7 percent of the total U.S. economy to 5.9 percent.
In his carefully calibrated testimony before House appropriators, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price made one thing clear Wednesday: The administration is still intent on dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act even if Republicans lack the votes to rewrite it.
Instead, they should use text, structure and history to understand what the law is, not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.
The document also pushes back on some of Trump's other more personal attacks of recent days, including a tweet that falsely asserted McCain finished last in his class at the Naval Academy in Annapolis.
In plain English, the attorney general's letter means that the Trump administration no longer supports a provision of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, that makes it possible for people to buy insurance if they have preexisting health conditions.
Some of them lost seats that were very safe, McCarthy said on the call. But it was kind of the policies that they wouldn't let go through of why they lost. And I think those seats are better for us to win, but also the quality of the candidate will matter more.
This morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will gather with other top Democrats on the steps of the Supreme Court, where they'll introduce a resolution condemning the Trump administration for now refusing to defend any part of the ACA in a legal challenge brought by conservative-led states.
Sarah Owermohle, Politico's drug and tobacco reporter:
So Democrats are deluding themselves about wresting control of impeachment from McConnell's bloodless grip. The only way to be rid of their nemesis is to win more seats. In the 100-member Senate, they need to grow their numbers from 47 (counting the two independents who caucus with them) to at least 50 or 51, depending on which party has the tie-breaking vice president. How likely is that?
[T]wo years, thousands of subpoenas, hundreds of search warrants, hundreds of witnesses, millions of taxpayer dollars, and these are the findings: No collusion. No conspiracy. No obstruction, McConnell said on the Senate floor in March after Attorney General William P. Barr — not special counsel Robert S. Mueller III — decided there wasn't enough evidence to implicate the president on obstructing the probe into Russian election interference.
Yesterday, I inadvertently mentioned that Senator Dole was joining the transition team as the vice chair. That is my mistake. Senator Dole continues to be a huge supporter and has been extremely helpful in the transition process, but due to some time commitments that he has, he's not able to take on an official role with the transition executive committee.
After more noise, Harris calmed the chatter.
• Create federal grants to encourage more states to enact red flag laws allowing family members or police to ask a court to temporarily remove firearms from people exhibiting violent behavior.
He notes that many accounts he heard of the Trump White House conflicted one another. In some cases, Wolff says, he let the players offer competing versions of reality while in other cases, he said that through a consistency in accounts and through sources I have come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true.
You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes. People said that can't be done. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it.
That system worked fine for both states until the Trump administration last fall eliminated CSRs, thus reducing the amount of federal funding those states received to cover people in their Basic Health Programs.
In a historically old presidential field, candidates are still refusing to release their health records.
[Stimulus package offers relief for retirees with RMD waiver, penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals]
In one nonprofit clinic that serves HIV-positive men with severe health needs, nurses have had to let patients sit in soiled diapers, sometimes for hours, because the facility needs to save money. It normally relies on patients' food stamp money for funding, as our Post colleagues Jeff Stein and Josh Dawsey write in an extensive report on the crisis facing Puerto Rico. There's a full-time nurse who has two daughters, one who needs expensive asthma medication, and who plans to stop buying yogurt, meat or vegetables because of her reduced benefits.
Just last month, the administration implemented an immigration rule that has frightened and confused families into disenrolling U.S.-citizen children from Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
-- When asked, Handel says she would have voted for the House bill because it's better than the status quo. It is by no means a perfect bill, but it was important to get the process started, she told me before she held a meet-and-greet at a restaurant. And the process couldn't begin until we had a bill that was passed, right? So there's some good things in it: Being able to keep people on their parents' plan until they're 26, I think most people are A-okay with that. A lot of people ask me: Why can't we fix it? Well, we can't fix something that had the largest tax increase embedded in it in my lifetime [a reference to the individual mandate]. The only way to fix a tax increase is to repeal it.
The regulatory changes will take time.
Afterward, Trump's supporters feared the new strain of TDS was spreading among Republican leaders in Washington.
It's very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven't put it in quite yet but we're going to be doing it soon, Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), to be confirmed. That decision rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which hasn't scheduled a hearing.
Back in January, you gave an off-the-record interview to the New York Times. It was apparently audiotaped. Now, a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy, specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally. You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build. But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?
Fred Hiatt: Let's move on. We asked readers to send in questions.
The campaign employs more than 800 staffers and has spent more than $100 million on advertising in the past six weeks. To put that in perspective, the four top-polling Democrats in the race — Biden, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — have spent about $28 million on ads all year.
People can buy in. And then if people like us are right … then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment, Buttigieg said. He described dealing with his late father's terminal illness, stressing that Medicare made the process much easier.
She did not respond to a request for comment from The Post.
As the situation with Iran escalates, it is worth remembering that many key positions in the administration remain unfilled:
-- Trump plans to unveil a new White House office today with sweeping authority to overhaul the federal bureaucracy and, potentially, privatize some government functions. The Office of American Innovation, to be led by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, will operate as its own nimble power center within the West Wing and will report directly to Trump, Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker report. Viewed internally as a SWAT team of strategic consultants, the office will be staffed by former business executives and is designed to … create a lasting legacy for a president still searching for signature achievements. … Kushner's team is being formalized just as the Trump administration is proposing sweeping budget cuts across many departments, and members said they would help find efficiencies.

There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.
New York Times, 'Austerity, That's What I Know': The Making of a U.K. Millennial Socialist, by Ellen Barry: The general election of 2017 exposed the starkest generation gap in the recent history of British politics. Young voters broke dramatically for the Labour Party, whose socialist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to rebuild the welfare state and redistribute wealth. Hardened against the centrists of their parents' generation, they have tugged the party to the left, opening up rifts that are now fracturing Labour. The young also saw their views on exiting the European Union — three-quarters of them voted to Remain — bulldozed by Leavers their grandparents' age. [Alex] McIntyre is still angry that he was too young, by a year, to vote in that 2016 referendum. He is pale and lanky, discreetly tattooed, caustically funny and so well-mannered that he would rather miss his train than cut into a line. ('Being British can be limiting,' he observed.) He is not representative of a generation. But his grievance is generational: that the state has taken away benefits his parents and grandparents enjoyed, like low-cost housing and free education.
Higher taxes on rich people are popular — in one recent poll, 76 percent of registered voters wanted them to pay more. But wealthy campaign contributors have been blunt about conditioning future donations on lower tax rates. When the 2017 Trump tax bill was pending, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned colleagues that if Republicans did not get it passed, the financial contributions will stop and incumbents would lose their jobs. When lawmakers voted, more of them listened to their contributors than to their constituents.
But he grew most animated when discussing World War I. When I asked how he'd handle the current Iran crisis if he were in the Oval Office, Bloomberg mused at length about the emotion and miscalculations a century ago in Europe that spiraled into a four-year conflict, bringing down monarchies and forever changing the nature of combat. He said the best book he's read in a while is Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War, by the British journalist Max Hastings.

In the rather unlikely event that Sanders was elected president in a landslide of socialist enthusiasm, turning the Senate and the House socialist, and introducing punitive taxes to impoverish rich Fox News opinionators, O'Reilly would still be in trouble. Even if he lived in Ireland, he would have difficulty avoiding U.S. taxes unless he renounced his U.S. citizenship. The United States continues to regard U.S. expatriates as taxpayers, no matter where they reside. Ireland and the United States have a double taxation treaty, to prevent people being taxed twice for the same income — this might provide some loopholes for royalties and the like, but probably not enough to make an enormous difference. O'Reilly would likely find himself paying to support Sanders's socialist American utopia from overseas.
We need maximum flexibility, the president said. There is always a chance we will encounter unexpected challenges or there will be a new need for a vaccination effort.
There are still many states, territories — and the oft-ignored District of Columbia — left to vote in this year's nominating cycle. But Iowa and New Hampshire got to go first. They got to set the tone for the race. If Americans end up with an unsavory general-election choice between Sanders and Trump, they could begin by placing the blame with the supposedly sage voters of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Biden appears determined to portray Sanders as divisive and eager to avoid getting bogged down in a back-and-forth over issues of his opponent's choosing. What we can't let happen in the next few weeks is let this primary turn into a campaign of negative attacks, he told reporters in Los Angeles around the time Sanders spoke in Vermont. The only thing that will do is help Donald Trump.
Any information we provide to our software vendors including HIV status information is encrypted and at no point did we share sensitive information like HIV status with advertisers, Case said in a statement. As the testing of our feature is completed, any information related to HIV status has been removed from Apptimize and we are in the process of discussing removal of this data from Localytics.
Trump repeatedly predicted the virus's quick demise around the time the World Health Organization said the virus had infected more than 46,000 people, had killed at least 1,116 and was on a path to spread vastly more widely. Administration public health officials disputed Trump's prediction, which appeared to be rooted in the idea that flu season in the United States generally ends in the spring. The virus was already spreading in Singapore, where temperatures are akin to summer in the United States.
TRUMP: It's very, very hard to get people. But other hotels do the exact same thing. And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process. This is a procedure. It's part of the law. I take advantage of that. There's nothing wrong with it. We have no choice.
Some Democrats deplored the move, calling for the abolition of ICE and the HHS warehouselike influx shelters.
Rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders routinely castigate Bloomberg by name, presenting him as an avatar for the outsize influence of the billionaire class in politics. It's an easy, cheap shot if you don't have any money to criticize people who do have money, he answered. But I'm spending my money to try to educate the voters and make this country better and to give me the opportunity to devote what would probably be the rest of my life to helping the country that my children and grandchildren are going to live in long after I'm gone.
The poll also found, Only 27 percent of American voters say they are proud to have Donald Trump as president, while 53 percent say they are embarrassed – a 2-1 negative. In other words, a catchy campaign message could suggest it would be nice to have a president who doesn't make you cringe.
Crack down on China's lax labor and environmental standards. (Trump has done little to crack down on human rights abuses in China or elsewhere and, according to former national security adviser John Bolton, encouraged Xi on China's concentration camps for Uighur Muslims.)
On other fronts, in Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Parson has announced that if a ballot referendum expanding Medicaid passes in 2020, he'll carry out the proposal, even if he personally disagrees with it. In 2018, referendums passed in three deep-red states — Idaho, Nebraska and Utah — and the expansion has been adopted in all three.
The purpose of the Wheaton meeting is to try to shift the conversation back to core questions of the faith, and Trump as an individual will not be the focus of discussion, Birdsall said. Nonetheless, the president will be the elephant in the room, he said, because under his leadership the term evangelical has become negatively associated in the minds of many Americans with regard to topics such as racism and nationalism.
So it's not one or the other or how to do it. We're going to make sure that we dual-track some of these things in terms of the repeal and replace of Obamacare, as well as fundamental tax reforms. Last night was another example of a meeting to coordinate that effort, to make sure that we have a plan going forward.
TRUMP: I don't believe these politicians. All talk, no action. I'm standing here listening to -- I'm hearing him say about a percentage. CNN, he gets 15. That means 85 percent, based on what you're saying, of the people don't dig you, number one, number one. Is that a correct statement? How do you get -- are you at 15 in the new CNN poll? Do you believe in CNN? I mean, I know we're with FOX. But CNN spent -- CNN...
The new analysis documents county by county that even as average ACA premiums for the most popular level of coverage dipped slightly for this year — the first time that has happened since the marketplaces opened in 2014 — there is wide geographic variation in how affordable rates are, Amy writes.
It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe.
There are promising signs out of the Trump administration, Welch said. I think there is a significant potential Trump is going to step up on prescription drug pricing.
WALLACE: But that doesn't really cut the federal deficit.
-- New York Times A1, For Solace and Solidarity in the Trump Age, Liberals Turn the TV Back On, by Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin: There is a new safe space for liberals in the age of [Trump]: the television set. Left-leaning MSNBC, after flailing at the end of the Obama years, has edged CNN in prime time. Stephen Colbert's openly anti-Trump 'Late Show' is beating Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight' for the first time. Bill Maher's HBO flock has grown nearly 50 percent … Traditional television, a medium considered so last century, has watched audiences drift away for the better part of a decade. Now rattled liberals are surging back, seeking catharsis, solidarity and relief. The turbocharged ratings are a surprise even to seen-it-all television executives, who had been bracing for a plunge in viewership after the excitement of the presidential campaign. Instead, the old analog favorites are in … Despite a dizzying array of new media choices, viewers are opting for television's mass gathering spots, seeking the kind of shared experience that can validate and reassure.
Did Donald Trump Jr. hate-watch the Oscars?
CMS Administrator Seema Verma called it the most cost-effective enrollment season ever, saying CMS spent just over $1 per each Healthcare.gov enrollee compared to $11 per enrollee during the final year of the Obama administration. She posted a few tweets:
-- Lawmakers in Maryland are rushing to pass a package of opioid bills in the final weeks of the legislative session, introducing at least 30 bills aimed at combatting a ballooning drug crisis that, according to a Post-University of Maryland Poll, touches one in three state residents. Two of the most sweeping measures are expected to come up for floor votes this week. (Josh Hicks)
Sanders said he wants a substantive debate over policy differences, not Trump-type personal attacks. Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country, and Joe and I are running very different campaigns, he said on Wednesday. My hope is that, in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have.
The National Academy of Sciences holds a workshop on The Promise of Genome Editing Tools to Advance Environmental Health Research on Jan. 10-11.
Bloomberg is investing heavily in online advertising, my colleagues Isaac Stanley-Becker and Michael Scherer reported last month. He has bought $4.6 million of Google ads, while on Facebook, his spending over a single week ran at more than $170,000 per day, 2 ½ times the level of Trump's reelection campaign.
As for the Planned Parenthood provision, Collins said she expects that she and Murkowski will push an amendment to strike it if it is not removed before the bill hits the Senate floor.
Hoyer also angered Omar's supporters by saying that when someone accuses American supporters of Israel of dual loyalty, I say: Accuse me — a non-subtle reference to Omar's February comments attacking political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country. Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer went even further, twinning the president and Omar: When someone looks at a neo-Nazi rally and sees some, 'very fine people' among its company, we must call it out. When someone suggests money drives support for Israel, we must call it out.
Among the Republicans who early on recognized Biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are Utah's Mitt Romney, Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski.
KELLY: ... Senator Rubio, standby, let him finish his point, and then I'll give you the floor...
But having taken the time to scroll through the legislation, my cumulative impression was different than I expected. There is, of course, funding for vaccine distribution, testing and contact tracing, state and local health departments, genomic surveillance, emergency medical supplies and global pandemic response, rural hospitals, community health centers, mental health services, VA hospitals, the Indian Health Service and Obamacare subsidies. There is funding for farm loans, food stamps, libraries and school lunches. There is funding for child-care block grants, private schools that enroll low-income children, small businesses, nonprofits, rental assistance, mortgage payment assistance, emergency housing vouchers, public transportation, restaurants, aging and disability services, the Fish and Wildlife Service, airlines, the earned-income tax credit and paid sick leave.
OUCH: Planned Parenthood's new president Leana Wen is ready for a fight against the Trump administration, which is expected to soon announce a final Title X family-planning funding plan, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.
The best example of branding derived from a shutdown is probably the case of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) His 24-hour speech before the 2013 shutdown, during which he read Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters on C-SPAN, helped make the otherwise obscure freshman a national figure, loathed and ridiculed by many but lionized by the most fervent opponents of the ACA. It turned him into a plausible, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, contender for the 2016 presidential nomination.
The on-screen banners known as chyrons (kai-rahns) were once flat, artless labels (President Holds Press Conference, Fire Destroys Home, etc.) that were about as exciting as an airport arrival-and-departure board.
President Trump cast blame Sunday for the collapse of his effort to overhaul the health-care system on conservative interest groups and far-right Republican lawmakers, shifting culpability to his own party after initially faulting Democratic intransigence.
Driving the organization is the stark libertarian philosophy of the network's founder, Charles Koch, who has long sought to curtail the reach of the federal government.
The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program — funded at the cost of less than a single shuttle flight — was aimed at encouraging private companies to develop the capacity to serve the transport needs of the International Space Station. The program was piloted under President George W. Bush, but in a somewhat surprising move (and over the objections of congressional Republicans), the Obama administration extended and expanded the initiative. That gave the competitive private industry just enough breathing room to get across the finish line with cheap, safe reusable spacecraft to ferry cargo and eventually humans. It was a small bet that paid off bigly under Donald Trump, who had the good sense to leave well enough alone for once.
During the brief period since his election, President-elect Donald Trump has begun to revise his health-care agenda in ways that conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades.
Because the market is hard for a biosimilar to penetrate, I worry that companies are going to pull out and not develop new biosimilars, he said.
A Democratic senator criticized Trump's foreign policy:
The original ambition was not so grand. A handful of conservative law students at the University of Chicago, Yale and Harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. When we started the Federalist Society, we didn't know we were starting the Federalist Society, Lee Liberman Otis, one of the Chicago co-founders, told me. We thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'Let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' 
Ryan did not take questions on the roughly 10-minute call. Zack Roday, a spokesman for the speaker's political operation, declined to comment. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for the speaker's office, said Ryan huddled with Trump at the White House on Monday and also met separately about the coming legislative agenda with Vice President Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. It's safe to say we're having these conversations, she said. We look forward to talking with our members on Tuesday when we get back.
-- It's not just the long shots staking out positions that could prove toxic in a general election: Elizabeth Warren opened the door in New Hampshire this weekend to paying reparations to Native Americans. They should be part of the conversation, she said. (Annie Linskey)
In the case of a second ballot, a candidate must win a majority of available pledged delegates AND superdelegates, which would increase the magic number needed to secure the nomination to 2,375.5.
Warren cut off Azar several times to clarify that no companies were near cutting prices as the president had said.
OUCH: The National Institutes of Health now requires all visitors to disclose citizenship in order to enter its facilities. It's a policy that recently led to disputes with two Iranian scientists invited to make presentations who were blocked when trying to enter one of the institute's buildings, our colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Lena H. Sun and Lisa Rein report.
He's a life-long hunter and fisher, who grew up outside of Glacier National Park. He's got a strong appreciation of the importance of public land and its conservation for future generations.

What should I do if I've been laid off or furloughed?
-- Trump is keeping his distance from the Republicans who might vote to call witnesses after White House advisers warned the president that outreach wouldn't help his cause. Democrats are also giving them space. Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: Democrats say there is no serious effort to privately lobby the Republicans, with the party relying instead on public opinion and the House prosecutors to squeeze them into breaking ranks.
Still, Heye said Trump's twin reversals on health care and immigration show his ability to drive enthusiasm in his political base while bowing to the reality of governing.
I think what you should expect going forward is an industry and PCMA that's more aggressive, more active in the drug pricing debate at the federal and state levels, which hasn't necessarily been a strength in the past, a source familiar with group's board discussions told me.
From Dan Snyder: Weren't you in that sexy secret video I never saw? (Steve Smith, Potomac, Md.)
The Trump administration eventually agreed with that assessment.
-- Trump is taking almost no steps to expand his support and broaden his leadership of the Republican Party, Annie Linskey reports on the front page of The Boston Globe: Two-thirds of the president's domestic travel for public events has been to states that he won, including all of his travel this month ... His few trips to blue states seem mostly happenstance, because they are home to government facilities Trump visited, such as Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. There are times you think: 'Does he even want to run for reelection?' said Peter Barca, a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and a Democrat.
Barr called Russian President Vladimir Putin a potent rival of the United States whose aim is to weaken American alliances throughout Europe — yet also warned that he believes China posed a major threat.
-- The Capitals beat the Rangers 6-5. (Samantha Pell)
The report added that the work was ongoing: The agencies have undertaken considerable work to revise their methods to estimate the effects of repealing the individual mandate. … Because that work is not complete and significant changes to the individual mandate are being considered as part of the budget reconciliation process, the agencies are publishing this update now without incorporating major changes to their analytical methods. The report added that the preliminary indication was the estimated effects on the budget and health insurance coverage would probably be smaller than the numbers reported in this document.
You can blame Iowa Democrats for what were, in hindsight, obviously inadequate preparations, from training the organizers to testing their app. But you can't really blame them, or their caucuses, for breaking down under strains that are testing both parties across the nation — the strain of an increasingly geographically sorted electorate, and the intra-party insurgencies bred by those divisions. Maybe the Iowa caucuses simply can't comfortably accommodate these new political realities. But then, it's not clear that the rest of our system can, either.
Today, we're also living in an alternate universe in which Cruz is the Republican establishment candidate. None other than Jeb Bush has endorsed him, and Mitt Romney voted for him in the Utah caucuses. That means Cruz is likely to get more endorsements from D.C. if (or when) it comes down to him and Trump in a contested convention in July.

All but one candidate say they'd reenter Iran deal: In a show of hands, Booker was the only candidate to indicate that he would not reenter the Iran nuclear deal that former president Barack Obama negotiated and President Trump abandoned.

The man Trump would need to sign off on blowing up the filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), understands its value better than most. McConnell has spent twice as long leading his party in the minority than the majority, and he remembers all too well how helpful the filibuster was in those years.
Four of the FDA's most recent commissioners all admitted to STAT the push for independence is still in its infancy, even after years of consideration, he writes. They acknowledged that though they've been batting around the ideas together since 2016, modifying the agency's structure — which would require a change to federal law — is unlikely to happen any time soon.
That lopsided margin among college educated white women could have lasting implications. By the way, the averages have the spread a bit tighter (six points) than ABC does, so keep that in mind.
Collins is among the moderates who might join Heller in rejecting the bill over cuts to Medicaid. She has said she is waiting to see the CBO's estimate on how many people stand to lose coverage and how premiums would be affected.

We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That's my opinion.
Sanders will end the race at some point, a diminished figure. In retrospect, his wins in 2016 will be seen more as an anti-Hillary Clinton vote than a pro-Sanders vote. How he behaves at Sunday's debate will determine whether he leaves a bad taste in the mouths of Democrats.
A new report, commissioned by Covered California, finds a significant increase in media coverage of enrollment nationwide during the sign-up period that ran from November through mid-December, compared to the year prior. There was more news coverage involving the terms enrollment, enrollment period and deadline – 53%, 125% and 129% percent more coverage for each term, respectively – for the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period, the firm Ogilvy & Mather found.
Now we have kids literally laying in their own snot, he said. That is not a sign of strength. That is a sign of weakness.
Swalwell: We can't be a forward-looking party if we look to the past for our leadership.
— A top adviser to Pelosi told about two dozen attendees at a November meeting that House Democratic leadership was worried about the push for Medicare-for-all from some in the party, calling on health policy groups to raise public concerns about it, Politico's Adam Cancryn reports. It was just weeks after the party had recaptured the House majority.
In the absence of any other federal governmental party in the case presenting a complete defense to the Congressional enactment at issue, this court may benefit from the participation by the House, Southwick said. In the context of this case, the motion to intervene was not untimely. Further, intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the rights of the original parties.
Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) vote against the GOP's replacement for Obamacare was as dramatic as it was significant. With the vote coming down to the wire, McCain made a bold statement by walking over and delivering his decisive no vote with a thumbs-down.
I just won my Senate race and I talked about health care, a lot, said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).
The Maryland Insurance Commissioner released rate requests from three other insurers, which ranged from 18 to 37 percent increases. A 40-year-old nonsmoker in the Baltimore area would face premiums ranging from $359 a month to $715 for a benchmark plan, before receiving any federal subsidies.
I can disagree with Republican policy, she said, but I find Trump disgusting as a human being.
In an earlier television age, news stations had to let the pictures and the talking heads do the talking. What little on-screen text there was consisted of names and titles, rendered by means of a slide that was projected, or superimposed, on the screen. The process was time-consuming and cumbersome, hardly suited for the vagaries of breaking news and live TV.
I wanted to ask you a quick question on two things -- Manufacturing Council, back in mid-December, you had said Liveris was appointed, but that you would be naming the rest of the board soon, in the next two weeks. I was seeing if there was any update on that.
We propose an approach aimed at making enrollment into insurance as automatic as possible, they continue. This will be a complex undertaking. Nonetheless, once it is up and running, we believe this approach can dramatically improve enrollment into insurance, and thus help to stabilize the market and make it more attractive for all consumers.
GREAT news this week regarding the Keystone XL pipeline — moving forward with fantastic paying CONSTRUCTION jobs for hardworking Americans, Trump tweeted on April 3. Promises Made, Promises Kept!
The first move was nominating a marginal (to be polite) Trump toady, Stephen Moore, to be a Federal Reserve Board governor. The second was having the Justice Department support a federal judge's decision to kill the entire Affordable Care Act.
TRUMP: ... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course. We have an A from the Better Business Bureau. And, people like it. Now, he's saying they didn't learn.
I thought either you were lying or that you didn't realize you had to pay, he said.
Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), a House Freedom Caucus member, said his office surveyed thousands of constituents about the health-care bill and found the response to be overwhelmingly against it — not just among Democrats, but independents and Republicans, too.
Parscale seized on the Democratic Party's explanation that they were doing quality control on the results coming in.
I understand that if you're not here illegally, the whole situation, I get that, Pitt said, but I feel like if you're already here you can't just throw people out of the country like wild animals that just jumped over the fence and you're throwing them back in somebody's yard.
So far it looks to be working.
A 2015 reconciliation bill that repealed major parts of Obamacare also included language defunding Planned Parenthood. That bill passed both houses of Congress and was vetoed by Obama. Republicans expect President-elect Donald Trump to sign the coming reconciliation bill. While Trump has spoken positively about Planned Parenthood in the past, he said last year that as long as they do the abortion I am not for funding Planned Parenthood.
But it's also easy to forget that the health-care overhaul was Obama's biggest domestic accomplishment. The Democratic presidential candidates are devoting much of their airtime these days to discussing Americans' persistent struggles with costs — a troubling problem the ACA didn't solve. And they're looking to go beyond the ACA by adopting a Medicare-for-all system in which the government would become the single largest payer in the system.
A third big change will be the form and size of the subsidies provided by the federal government to those working-class families without employer-provided health insurance who buy policies on the Obamacare exchanges. Republicans would replace the current premium subsidies with tax credits, the size of which would be adjusted for income and age but in total will be significantly less than Obamacare's premium subsidies. So working-class people will pay higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for health insurance that is less comprehensive — or they will go uninsured — while the people who financed Obamacare through higher taxes will be paying less by about the same amount.
And then there's also the question of how voters might react if told they would lose their current coverage. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who has gone the furthest of all the 2020 candidates in pushing for an overhaul of the U.S. health-care system, attracted widespread attention recently when she suggested she'd be fine with entirely eliminating private coverage in favor of government-run plans.
Andrew Yang: When I talk to Americans, they do not want us to be in a constant state of armed conflict as we've been for 19 years and counting. There are ways that we can combat ISIS that don't involve semi-permanent occupation of certain territories. So I have a three-part test for armed intervention. No. 1, there is a clear, national interest at stake or the ability to avert a humanitarian crisis. No. 2, there's a clearly defined timeline where we can bring our troops out. And No. 3, we have allies and partners that are willing to join us in the mission. Something like ISIS would satisfy all three, where there is a clear national interest, we should be able to define a timeline, and if we have partners and allies that are willing to join us in that that mission, which we do in that case, then we'll be able to act in concert. So I do not want to engage in forever wars …
— Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is set to have a hernia operation at a privately administered hospital in Canada next month, a procedure related to his 2017 injury that occurred when a neighbor attacked Paul while he was mowing his lawn, the Louisville Courier Journal's Thomas Novelly reports.
The bill largely mirrors the House measure that narrowly passed last month but with some significant changes aimed at pleasing moderates. While the House legislation tied federal insurance subsidies to age, the Senate bill would link them to income, as the ACA does. The Senate proposal cuts off Medicaid expansion more gradually than the House bill,\ but would enact deeper long-term cuts to the health-care program for low-income Americans. It also removes language restricting federally subsidized health plans from covering abortions, which may have run afoul of complex budget rules.
So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.
Clinton leads by 17 points among women, while men divide essentially evenly, 42-45 percent, Clinton-Trump….Trump leads by 7 points among whites, Clinton by 49 points among nonwhites. Trump's best group demographically remains white men who don't have a four-year college degree, a 61-29 percent advantage over Clinton. She counters with virtually the same margin, 60-32 percent, among college-educated white women.
Reid has suggested that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with whom he must work every day, agrees with Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs. He's accused Republicans of being drunk with power, puppets, amateurish and cowards who are led by crazies.
-- The incident seemed to confirm British Muslims worst fears following recent attacks by radical Islamists. Griff Witte and Karla Adam report: Witnesses said the driver was heard shouting after he was wrestled to the ground that he wanted to kill Muslims. It was chilling but not, in the Finsbury Park neighborhood, entirely unexpected. Fears have been growing among Muslims here that they could be singled out by extremists in tit-for-tat attacks because of other attacks carried out in the name of Islam, even though they are widely denounced by the mainstream Muslim community … 'We don't feel safe anywhere,' said a young man who gave his name as Adil Rana. 'We don't feel safe walking the streets or going to the mosque.'
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb speaks alongside former agency commissioners at a Bipartisan Policy Center event.
But led by the White House, Republicans had elevated the race to a high-stakes referendum on the president and the GOP. Trump made two appearances with Saccone, including a Saturday-night rally in the district, and his son Donald Trump Jr. stumped with Saccone on Monday. The president repeatedly linked his brand to Saccone.
On one hand, you don't like handing the other side a potential campaign message at any point, and Democrats will inevitably try to make this into a 'Trump wants to cut your Medicare' argument, Republican pollster Chris Wilson said. But Wilson argued that the plan probably would not reverberate as the ACA repeal push did. A proposed cut to entitlements in a budget proposal that has no chance of passing the House just isn't going to enter the public consciousness in the same way, he added.
With an amendment, Northam might be able to reshape the plan to win over Hanger, perhaps by sparing rural hospitals like the one in Hanger's district from the hospital tax. Northam noted last week — as a gentle warning — that he could strip out some of the conservative sweeteners if legislators leave it to him.
One more thing: I was at the U2 concert along with many other D.C. folks last night. Look who showed up, onstage nonetheless:
No easy resolution has appeared, and despite loose talk from White House aides and staff-level conversations this week, little has been done to court Democratic support for his priorities. Meanwhile, most Democrats remain wary of Trump's hard-line policies and incendiary persona, and the confirmation vote on Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, faces a potential filibuster by Senate Democrats.
CVA's critics — including the congressionally chartered veterans groups — acknowledge the need for some private care, but they argue that unfettered privatization would be costly and siphon resources from the VA system.
And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue. You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing. Because he doesn't have answers.
-- The Trump administration has outlined a new plan for dealing with Russia — but will the president support it? BuzzFeed's John Hudson reports: [Rex Tillerson] has crafted a three-point framework for future US-Russia relations that takes a narrow view of what can be achieved between the former Cold War adversaries, but seeks a constructive working relationship with Putin on a limited set of issues. The first pillar of the [still-classified] framework, a US official said, is to convey to Moscow that aggressive actions against the United States are a losing proposition that will be counterproductive for both sides. When Russia takes bold actions against American interests … Washington will push back. [The second pillar is to] engage on issues that are of strategic interest to the United States, including the [war] in Syria, North Korea's rapidly developing nuclear weapons program, and cybersecurity and cyberespionage … The third pillar of the framework emphasizes the importance of 'strategic stability with Russia, an umbrella term that encompasses a range of long-term mutual geopolitical goals.

TRUMP: I'm not only talking about drugs, I'm talking about other things. We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate. We don't do that. We don't negotiate. We don't negotiate anything.
Three months after 61 percent of the state's voters approved Medicaid expansion, a group of 15 conservative state lawmakers in Idaho are working on a bill to add work requirements and monthly premiums for individuals eligible for the expanded program, Kaiser Health News's Phil Galewitz reports.

Virginia, with its legislature under GOP control, staunchly resisted Obamacare expansion for four years under Northam's predecessor, Terry McAuliffe (D). Opposition in softened in the House after Democrats nearly took control of the chamber in an anti-Trump wave in November.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said McCarthy's remarks were very troublesome after a reporter described them. I hoped the us-versus-them mentality of the past was something that indeed was in the past, he said.
There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.
Even though the gathering isn't about politics, Yang said she expects discussion around major events of the past year, including the #MeToo movement about sexual assault and harassment, the white supremacy march in Charlottesville, and Trump's refugee and immigration policy changes. About six leaders from outside the United States, she said, will tell the group how evangelicals are perceived globally.
You can make an unemployment claim online, over the phone or in person. The payout is based on how much you earned and aims to replace about half of your previous income. It also varies by state: In Mississippi, which pays the least among the 50 states, the average benefit in February was $215 a week; in Massachusetts, which pays the most, it was $550, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Such referendums are another sign that it's becoming harder for Republican legislators to stand in the way of voter support for the Medicaid expansion. After all, the logic of it is overwhelming: The federal government picks up almost the entire tab of expanding health care to enormous numbers of state officials' own constituents.
KELLY: Senator Rubio, you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight, but you're still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally. And in addition...
-- Trump's reelection campaign is already running ads on Facebook touting Suleimani's death. From the Times: 'Thanks to the swift actions of our commander in chief, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is no longer a threat to the United States, or to the world,' several of the Trump ads read, using an alternate spelling of the Iranian general's name. Some featured pictures of a beaming Mr. Trump from one of his campaign rallies; others showed a stoic, finger-waving president, also in front of supporters. The ads asked voters to take the 'Official Trump Military Survey,' directing users to Mr. Trump's re-election campaign website. All told, the Trump campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads about the killing of General Suleimani, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group.
—Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, indicated as much, saying he's focused on legislation to reduce overall health-care costs.
And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS. And what that's going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. We are going to see wages going up. We are going to see opportunity.
That's because the law's most widespread feature is helping people buy health insurance, and the link between being covered by health insurance and actually being healthier is not fully understood. … health is a cumulative, complex and long-term outcome, determined not only by health insurance status, but by socioeconomic factors, genetics, lifestyle and the neighborhoods where people live . The differences between having insurance and not having insurance often encapsulates a broad swath of other factors that affect people's well-being.

Key excerpt: The New York Post got its hands on outtakes from a nude photo shoot that Melania had done early in her modeling career — a leak that everybody other than Melania assumed could be traced back to Trump himself. Inconsolable, she confronted her husband. Is this the future? She told him she wouldn't be able to take it. Trump responded in his fashion — We'll sue! — and set her up with lawyers. But he was uncharacteristically contrite, too. Just a little longer, he told her. It would all be over in November. He offered his wife a solemn guarantee: There was simply no way he would win.

If the health plan takes up your biosimilar then they lose all those rebates, Gottlieb said. Now you have to discount your biosimilar to a point where you offset the loss of the rebates to the health plan.
Trump's second impeachment trial begins tomorrow. You can follow The Post's latest impeachment coverage here.
Current and former White House officials said that CVA is among a number of veterans groups that have a voice in the administration, and said Trump's views on veterans policies have been driven by his own observations on the campaign trail.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the Supreme Court, swore in Vice President Harris, the first woman to hold the job. Sotomayor did the same for then-Vice President Biden in 2013.
Yet some advisers have pushed Trump to focus more on a message of economic success. The president, for example, visited a General Dynamics tank plant in Lima, Ohio, recently to talk about job growth in the state. But aides and outside advisers were frustrated when he spent a portion of his speech attacking the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), an angry screed that dominated headlines out of the event.
Around June 2017, Barr said, he began noticing news reports about possible theories of obstruction of justice Mueller might be looking into. Though he acknowledged he had no facts, Barr said he was concerned about the precedent Mueller might be setting.
This could include people who required an extension to file their taxes or who requested a special exemption allowing them to enroll outside the sign-up season. It's the IRS's job to verify such enrollees are making the income they claim or have experienced special life circumstances (such as having a baby, for example) allowing them to enroll after the enrollment window has closed.

Hatch also sent a letter to McCain — who is at home in Arizona battling a serious form of brain cancer — apologizing for his comment and for suggesting that McCain wouldn't return to the Senate, Sean and Paul write.
Harris's staff emphasize that she said 129 million could be denied coverage: They could be denied coverage if they lost their employer coverage and the potential cuts from Medicaid would eventually put a bunch of people at risk, as well.
Recent polling shows that voters want lower costs and expansion of coverage. There is little popular support for ripping out all private health-care coverage (obtained through employers or otherwise) and even less for taking health-care coverage away from 20 million people.
He's been working on fundamental tax reform for 20 years, and now he's gotten it done. He's been working on entitlement reform. It may not happen on his watch, but they were working on Obamacare before Obama was even born, said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.). Some of these ideas will be achieved in one Congress; some will take many congresses. But he was the one who really showed the way.
Democrats' long-term plan for reclaiming the House majority has anticipated a demographic pivot where well-educated, wealthy suburban dwellers who tended to vote Republican become increasingly Democratic over time. Trump, party strategists argue, has accelerated that pivot to the point that districts thought to be out of reach until 2018 or beyond are now in play.
Part of the difficulty stems from the anonymity of online drug traffickers. Buyers can access stores on private web browsers, can use encrypted channels to make purchases and use virtual currency such as bitcoin to pay for the drugs. This year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions doubled the number of federal agents working on drug cases by these darknet vendors, the AP writes.
The takeaway: The study's results are mixed.
TRUMP: I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...
By applying for and receiving a 1332 waiver (named after the pertinent section of the ACA), states can make a range of changes to how the insurance marketplaces function. Nearly all the 1332 waivers granted so far allow states to set up reinsurance programs in which insurers get help paying for higher-cost patients, allowing them to lower premiums for everyone across the board.
Those senators are still divided, however, on whether the replacement must be devised now or sometime in the future.
BIDEN SPEAKS OUT ABOUT CUOMO: Biden called on embattled New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign if an investigation confirms claims he committed sexual harassment, ABC News's Ben Gittleson writes.
It's fine in their book to watch Trump's manic conduct infuriate experts and see hardship inflicted on immigrant children -- until it hits home.
When cable channels began airing Trump's raucous campaign rallies live and in full, anchors and reporters couldn't — or wouldn't — speak over Trump. The only thing between the candidate's blunt pronouncements and viewers was the on-screen banner.

The FBI fell short in assessing homegrown terror threats.
Since Friday, Trump aides have been talking increasingly about reaching out to moderate Democrats for help not only on another health-care bill but also on other priorities. But prospects for such cooperation remain difficult.
Replacement of Obamacare, Trump said at a Wednesday news conference, would happen essentially simultaneously as its repeal and would be far less expensive and far better. In a New York Times interview published Tuesday, Trump indicated that legislation could come together within weeks.
Trump will receive his intelligence briefing before traveling to Ohio to speak at an Army tank plant and at a fundraising event.
-- Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) has had harsh words for Trump's posthumous McCain criticism, saying on the Senate floor in August that anybody who in any way tarnishes the reputation of John McCain deserves a whipping. Isakson told the Bulwark he'll expand on his remarks later on the Senate floor and that Trump's comments on McCain drive me crazy.
Totally disrespectful. No place for it, and he should apologize, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said, The Post reported at the time.
Rule of law is eroded when judges who rule against the government are dismissed as political hacks, when journalists who report the truth are deemed enemies of the people and any investigation of corruption is labeled a witch hunt.
Gut, if not eliminate, the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump has called a disgrace. (Depending upon how you define gut, Trump sought to make good on this promise. Many of his actions, although, remain tied up in the courts.)
I think there's a reason that he selected Dr. Price to be his HHS secretary, is because of a lot of the efforts, initiatives and legislation that Dr. Price has laid out. But he's continued to work with Dr. Price and the House and Senate leadership to figure out ways to sequence this thing, and ensure that the goals that he's setting out, which is both greater access and competition and negotiation to drive down costs are met.
Everything with Trump right now? Bad, she said. I just feel like with him in office, we've taken steps back. He definitely needs to go.
Chyrons, in other words, have become potent agents of influence.

-- A federal judge last night canceled the sentencing hearing for former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn that was set for Feb. 27. Judge Emmet Sullivan issued an order putting off the hearing indefinitely, pending a new order from him. Martin Weil reports: The move represents the latest turn in the case against Flynn, who pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Federal prosecutors once suggested probation for Flynn, then shifted to include prison time, and then said in a late January court filing that probation remained a 'reasonable sentence.' The prosecutors' Jan. 29 filing was submitted as Flynn continued his effort to withdraw his guilty plea.

Buttigieg, 38, has yet to release any medical records despite arguing last week that the candidates should undergo physical exams and disclose the results. Bloomberg, 78, released a single page from his doctor that said he's in great physical shape and that he plays golf avidly. Biden, 77, released a three-page letter describing him as healthy [and] vigorous. Sanders, 78, released letters from three doctors – including a cardiologist who said he has the mental and physical stamina to be president.

The findings are based on an examination of nearly 3,000 counties and 81 indicators and 10 categories that measure overall health, such as housing equality or obesity.
-- Pruitt brushed aside the controversies in an interview with the Washington Examiner, blaming the fallout on Washington's toxic culture. There are people that have long in this town done business a different way and this agency has been the poster child of it. And so do I think that because we are leading on this agenda that there are some who want to keep that from happening? Absolutely. And do I think that they will resort to anything to achieve that? Yes, Pruitt said. It's toxic here in that regard.

Many individual Federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the Federalist Society. Rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. In that sense, the Federalist Society is a talent network and placement agency as well.
A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for an explanation of the president's shift in position.
There is some momentum behind going back to earmarks, with the House Rules Committee set to start holding hearings on the subject next week. That momentum exists for the exact reason Trump highlighted: Congress has been historically gridlocked for years thanks to rising partisanship, and earmarks are a great way to grease the skids. If Congressman A from Nevada isn't so sure about your Obamacare replacement bill, getting tens of millions of dollars for infrastructure projects in Reno can be pretty compelling. With the GOP back in power but still struggling to pass major legislation, the time is ripe.

The tracker also shows how those premiums are changing from 2018 and what a 40-year-old enrollee making $30,000 annually would pay before and after available tax credits. Based on insurers' requested premium increases in the states available, benchmark premium increases before tax credits range from 7 percent to 36 percent in the cities included. The average increase in the benchmark silver premiums is 2 percent after tax credits for a 40-year-old enrollee with a $30,000 annual income. Check it out.

The speaker of the New York State Assembly ran into both Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on the same Amtrak train:
Trump, who has ventured west of the Mississippi River only once as president, has barely mentioned health care on his few stops outside Washington and his golf properties in Florida and New Jersey.

-- If the long shot plan were realized, it would fulfill a long-held conservative goal that has the potential to reduce federal help for the neediest Americans, write Amy Goldstein and Caitlin Dewey. The blueprint does not itself contain funding cuts for food stamps, cash assistance, Medicaid or other longtime pillars of the government's safety net. But it runs alongside President Trump's efforts in his budgets to slash funding for such programs. And it would buttress a case for reductions by pulling together programs in ways that make clearer how much the government is spending. The plan's very lexicon embraces conservative branding of federal assistance for the poor. It proposes to change the Department of Health and Human Services, as it has been called since 1980, to the Department of Health and Public Welfare, reviving a term that has acquired negative connotations on the right.

Trump associates said that he may be different but that, in a deeply divided Republican Party and in a Senate where McConnell struggles to find agreement, there is only so much he can do.
Politically, it is sensible for GOP outside groups to steer clear of this issue in their paid media. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that just one-quarter of likely voters in the costliest House race in U.S. history approve of the Republicans' American Health Care Act.
The climb-down came after Republican leaders and business executives warned him that shutting down the border would be catastrophic for the economy.
I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, Oh, you don't like China?
— CVS Health has opened three health-focused concept stores in Houston, which include expanded clinics, blood-testing labs and health screenings as well as dietitians and rooms for yoga, CNBC's Angelica LaVito reports.
If your landlord is an individual, rather than a management company, contact them personally to tell them you're struggling financially, said Long, from the American Institute of CPAs, and ask for flexibility with how much you'll pay per month until you get back on your feet.
They want to increase investment in infrastructure — but don't want to raise taxes or user fees to pay for it.
After trading direct messages with Fair on Twitter and appealing to Fair's supervisors last month, Nomani filed the complaint Thursday with the university's Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action organization.
The time for empty talk is over, Trump said. Now arrives the hour of action.
• Offer a public option insurance plan run by the federal government that Americans could consider alongside private plans.
(4) The Medicaid issue affects nearly every state and federal race. Democrats will argue that Republicans want to take away health care while Republicans will be forced to defend their votes and take a stance on expansion. That's a problem given how popular Medicaid expansion has become. (A poll conducted late last year by Public Opinion Strategies and the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association found 83 percent of the state's residents supported the expansion, including a majority of self-identified Republicans. . . . Polls show that two thirds of Utah voters support the Medicaid expansion in their state. So it's unlikely to be close, The Post report continued.) Meanwhile, Maine's controversial Republican Gov. Paul LePage is being sued for failure to expand Medicaid after a state referendum approving it passed with 59 percent of the vote.
The group behind the late February operation is known as Cheollima Civil Defense, a secretive dissident organization committed to overthrowing the Kim dynasty, people familiar with the planning and execution of the mission told The Washington Post.
DRIP, DRIP, DRIP: The New York attorney general's office issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank on Monday evening for records relating to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 2014, the New York Times's William Rashbaum and Danny Hakim report.
Kennedy stood by that day in Denver to administer the judicial oath, and he might soon be welcoming his former charge to the empty chair at the end of the Supreme Court's mahogany bench.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, said at an event at The Washington Post on Friday that GOP governors are working closely with both lawmakers and the administration to determine how to transition those living above the poverty line off the expanded Medicaid rolls.
True enough. But when Owens decries the victim mentality, she's signaling her allegiance to an alternative worldview. West, on the other hand, isn't concerned with the issues driving partisan politics; he craves reification of his self-image. Just five years ago, he released the song New Slaves, but a perusal of the lyrics leaves you unclear whether he's indicting the victim mentality against which Owens inveighs or is treading perilously close to engaging in it.
Trump will participate in the credentialing ceremony for newly appointed ambassadors to the United States. He will then give a speech on immigration with angel families. Tonight, the president and first lady will attend the Marine Corps' evening parade.
Wall Street rebounds: Major U.S. stock indexes rallied sharply as investors grew optimistic that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would soon intervene to limit the economic impact from the spread of the novel coronavirus, our colleagues Rachel Siegel and Thomas Heath reports.
As she prepared to suspend her campaign, top surrogates and allies of Warren and Sanders started preliminary discussions about ways their two camps could unite and push a common liberal agenda. Annie Linskey and Sean Sullivan reported that these conversations largely involved members of Congress who back Sanders reaching out to those in Warren's camp to explore the prospect that she might endorse him. But Warren associates and Biden's camp were also talking about a potential endorsement.
We continue to closely monitor the current political and programmatic developments pertaining to our 2018 participation in other Marketplace states, and subject to those developments, will withdraw from 2018 participation as may be necessary, Molina said in a news release.
It works for the Finns, said one diner, after being told about the universal basic income.
Today is the deadline for insurers to declare whether they'll sell plans on the Obamacare state marketplace in 2018 – and submit bids for the premiums they want to charge.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history —- 157 million.
But Azar, the former president of the U.S. division of Eli Lilly, has been touting the proposal all week at news briefings and in public speeches – and he pushed back on Reilly's comments yesterday, saying he would beg to differ.
Speakers at that first symposium included future justice Antonin Scalia, who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago and a mentor to the campus Federalist Society chapter. Choosing as his topic The Two Faces of Federalism, Scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: I urge you, then — as Hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. The trick is to use it wisely.

We're very aware that there is anxiety about — however imperfect — a system you know and doctors you know, and that is going to be all part of the hearing process, public input into: How do we build a system in this country that really cares about all Americans? said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), another co-sponsor of the Jayapal bill.
Of course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.
Pence professed ignorance, saying he hadn't heard about these policies. But just as Trump falsely claims he's safeguarding rather than jeopardizing protections for preexisting conditions, Pence insisted that whatever the administration had just announced surely involved expanding Medicaid coverage, not cutting it. As proof, Pence repeatedly touted his earlier work as governor of Indiana, where he had indeed expanded Medicaid — something he was able to do, of course, only because of the Affordable Care Act that he's now working to destroy.
Trump's performance has left residents underwhelmed. (The poll finds that likely voters in PA18 are divided on the president's overall job performance – 49% approve and 49% disapprove. Last month, Trump earned a slightly positive 51% approve and 47% disapprove rating.)
The president also reiterated his determination to constrain the price of prescription drugs. He gave his administration credit for what he contended was the largest slowing of drug prices last year in nearly a half-century. In an allusion to an administration proposal last week to end the widespread practice of passing drug rebates to middlemen, Trump said that drug manufacturers, health insurers and hospitals should disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.
Silverman's mother was beautiful, intelligent and artistic. She would direct more than 50 plays in their native New Hampshire and, after her divorce, in her 40s, enroll in college. But she was also distracted and flaky. There would be food in the house, but Sarah would be left to make her own meals. Laundry would pile up. She would often find herself waiting at school to be picked up; Beth Ann had forgotten.
Liberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the Federalist Society after the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore in 2000, handing the White House to George W. Bush. Peter Rubin, then a professor at Georgetown, founded the American Constitution Society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.
And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.

Last month, for example, the White House granted press credentials to the Gateway Pundit, a blog that is supportive of President Trump and that has promoted dubious reports about Hillary Clinton's health and the extent of voter fraud. White House press secretary Sean Spicer now regularly takes questions at daily briefings from pundits and talk-radio hosts via Skype.
Kayleigh McEnany, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said the president has a wide range of accomplishments to press in his case for reelection, a pitch she expects both Trump and the campaign to make.
Klobuchar: As a U.S. senator, I listened and I acted, and I think that's important in a president.
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: Last Day of Chemo. Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.
So now, imagine an America where Medicare-for-all ensures health care is a basic human right, she continued. Imagine an America where you could get your prescriptions filled, without worrying about the cost.
Democrats would firmly disagree that the Affordable Care Act does not work, given that the number of people without health insurance has sharply declined since it was passed in 2010. Some Democrats have proposed ways to reduce out-of-pocket costs, mainly by bolstering subsidies and extending the pool of people who would qualify for them.
We literally did every single thing we could do, says Cruz's campaign manager, Jeff Roe, in the video. Ted Cruz didn't lose. Our campaign for president lost.
We're pretty sure we felt that in 2019 and 2017 as well, but this time we hope that this latest installment of our biennial joint legislation contest will help our national lawmakers bind their wounds, and reach out across the aisle as they read the results of this contest, and in true concord, look straight at each other and say, Whaaaa?
Later that afternoon, Trump called Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, who asked him how the meeting had gone.
Democrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance.
How much political sway Kushner holds in Congress is questionable, but Richards said it still felt like a bribe. Richards also wrote that Kushner told her Planned Parenthood had made a big mistake by becoming 'political.' Richards' memoir Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead was released yesterday.
A funny observation from a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:
Texas officials torched the CDC: The agency released a woman who later was found to have the novel coronavirus, The agency released a woman who later was found to have the novel coronavirus, our colleagues write . The city unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the release of dozens of people scheduled to leave quarantine in the San Antonio area and demanded another round of tests be performed.
-- U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley responded to a U.N. report criticizing U.S. treatment of its poor. It is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America, Haley wrote in a letter to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In our country, the President, Members of Congress, Governors, Mayors, and City Council members actively engage on poverty issues every day. Compare that to the many countries around the world, whose governments knowingly abuse human rights and cause pain and suffering. (Jeff Stein)
Yes, but not many and it's not easy. In 1974, the Senate adopted a procedure known as reconciliation that allows for expedited consideration of legislation related to spending, taxing and the federal debt limit. Under reconciliation, a simple majority is all that's required for passage. But the process has limits: The Byrd rule -- named for Robert Byrd, a Democratic senator who represented West Virginia for 51 years -- requires that all provisions in a reconciliation bill have an impact on federal revenue, spending and deficits, and that no extraneous provisions are included. That forced Democrats to drop Biden's proposal for a national $15 an hour minimum wage from the virus-relief package. Republicans used reconciliation to pass tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017, and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, achieved final passage only by using reconciliation. Democrats fear that priorities like measures on voting rights or immigration would not qualify for reconciliation.
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies holds a hearing on electronic health record modernization on Wednesday.
I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, he tells the network's Jake Tapper. So I don't know. I don't know — did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.

As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit, Romney writes. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.
Even if the FDA advances the plans, they would take a long time to become reality, Anna writes. Gottlieb encouraged Congress to grant opioids that are proven safer a period of additional time to sell their treatment free from competition to prod development of such drugs.

• Trump: Voters don't care about seeing tax returns, accompanied by an underline reading, Poll: 78% say Donald Trump should release his tax returns. (CNN, September 2016).
Opposition in the House softened after Democrats — who ran on a promise to expand Medicaid — picked up 15 seats in November elections, nearly taking control of the chamber in an anti-Trump wave. During the 60-day legislative session that began in January, 19 House Republicans voted to expand Medicaid, apparently concluding they have more to fear from energized Democrats and independents than from potential primary challengers on the right.
— Discussion during the hearing largely revolved around ideas that have been floated before, such as a potential change to the rebate structure, restructuring the 340B federal drug discount program (which requires drug companies to give discounts to hospitals serving low-income people) and allowing Medicare Part D to negotiate directly with drug companies -- one proposal that Grassley has said he doesn't want to pursue.
CRUZ: That's not what Donald Trump did. Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan. Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush. If you don't like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.
Cruz called the House bill a positive step that the Senate must improve on. He named selling insurance across state lines and medical malpractice reform as two other priorities for a Senate bill seeking to replace Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act.
While the White House is not expected to explicitly say the United States is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, and people familiar with the White House deliberations say Mr. Trump has not decided whether to do so, the policy reversals would make it virtually impossible to meet the emissions reduction goals set by the Obama administration under the international agreement.
At a conference sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Vice President Pence suggested the White House remains focused on its agenda, regardless of distractions.
By framing the economic debate in terms of these widely supported aspirations, rather than a flawed set of policy litmus tests, Democrats could energize their base, unify their party and put Republicans on the defensive. Indeed, there is even model for such an approach: the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.
Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) are both planning to buck the president by helping pass the disapproval resolution.

Florida is in an alarming new upward spiral, with nearly 20,000 cases of the virus reported on Friday and more than 15,000 on Saturday. But the state's well-intended effort to throw open the doors of the vaccine program to everyone 65 and older has led to long lines, confusion and disappointment, the New York Times's Patricia Mazzei, Eric Adelson and Kate Kelly report.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends prescribers give no more than 50 morphine-milligram equivalents (MMEs), a standard of describing opioid doses, a day for less than seven days, but researchers calculated the top 1 percent of prescribers give more than 120 MMEs daily per patient.
CORRECTION: Ivanka Trump did not help Sen. Rubio craft his family leave bill, as the piece originally and inaccurately stated. She has been more generally involved in discussions with Republican senators interested in family leave legislation.

Trump says that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was not a hero because he was captured after being shot down over Vietnam.
Trump named the senators again — plus Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- in a tweet earlier in the day:
I think it's really hard for any of us to imagine what we can't see, Clinton added. And so I just am really proud that little girls will be able to redirect their imaginations in other ways, because my mother will have broken down this barrier.
Arguments that carbon taxes can spur innovation are discredited by Europe's decades-long experiment with high fuel taxes. Europeans pay much more per gallon of gas in taxes, amounting to the equivalent of a carbon tax of between $200 and $400 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Yet, as policy analyst Oren Cass has noted, sky-high carbon taxes such as these have not produced any innovative approaches to fossil-free transportation. Carbon taxes, however, are far from the only way conservatives can combat climate change.
There may never be a moment when no one is telling this administration to dial back its ambitions and be more afraid of backlash. But so far, they seem to have vaccinated themselves against it.
As the face of both Planned Parenthood and its political arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Richards massively grew the group's public profile. During her time as president, Richards greatly expanded the organization's fundraising and organizing capabilities — and helped raise its profile through celebrity-oriented campaigns and increased political participation, write BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer and Ema O'Connor, who first reported the news.

MORE ON THE CASE: The court accepted a case from Wisconsin, where a divided panel of three federal judges last year ruled that the state's Republican leadership in 2011 pushed through a plan so partisan that it violated the Constitution's First Amendment and equal rights protections. And they gave an indication of how divisive the issue might be: after granting the case, the court voted 5 to 4 to stay the lower court's decision, which had required new districts be drawn this fall. (The liberal justices each went on record saying they would have denied the stay, meaning the court's five conservatives granted it.)
Many white evangelicals have been too focused on what they view as issues of sin and personal morality, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, without looking at the systemic injustices that most concern black evangelicals, such as economic inequality and radicalized policing, he said, adding the bill has now come due.
The cautionary message, published online Thursday in the journal Circulation, came in the organization's first comprehensive scientific statement on the complex interactions between breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, Laurie writes. In many ways, the AHA statement is trying to change the mind-set of women diagnosed with breast cancer who consider it the biggest threat to their health. It noted that breast cancer survivors who are 65 and older and were treated for their cancer are more likely to die of cardiovascular problems than breast cancer.
It's really one of the more inspiring things I've seen, like the mouse pulling the thorn out of the tiger's paw, McKay says.

— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.

Trump also once again voiced support for Rep. Ron DeSantis in Florida's contested GOP gubernatorial primary:
North Korea is proceeding with its missile program, from what we see in the media. We've tried bluster and we've tried negotiation. Should we consider reducing our demands that Pyongyang denuclearize entirely? Would you meet face to face with Kim Jong Un?
3. Call to Defend President Trump (The Committee to Defend the President)
Attendance was expected to be robust Saturday at the Women's March on Washington, a display of opposition to Trump. City officials said that four times as many requests were made for parking permits for buses that day than on the day of Trump's inauguration.
The rising tensions followed a flurry of finger-pointing after Friday's decision by Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to pull the health-care measure, effectively ending for now the GOP's years-long quest to repeal President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.
Heritage Action for America called that effort a trial run in a July 2015 memo, one that would reaffirm the Republican-controlled Congress's commitment to sending a bill repealing Obamacare to the president's desk in 2017 — when it will hopefully be signed into law.
What are the problems with the ACA you think need to be fixed?
So we reach out in numerous ways: Through national media interviews, through national White House press conferences, through regional media interviews, through Facebook town halls, Carney continued.
-- Republicans have been in similar positions before. After Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security, leading Republicans ran on repealing the system, which they saw as an un-American redistribution of wealth. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower finally brought the GOP out of the wilderness after two decades by embracing the idea of Social Security and promising to keep other New Deal programs intact. Barry Goldwater famously attacked Eisenhower for offering a dime store New Deal when he proposed government medical care for the elderly.
-- A fuller picture is emerging of Jay Sekulow, Trump's new lawyer and Sunday-show defender who is not well known among Washington's criminal attorneys. Sari Horwitz, Devlin Barrett and Tom Hamburger report: [Sekulow] is, however, a fixture on conservative talk radio and a celebrity among conservative organizations for his high-profile First Amendment court battles over religious rights. He has argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court. Along with his own widely syndicated daily radio talk show, Jay Sekulow Live! — broadcast on more than 850 radio stations, satellite radio and on his website — Sekulow is also a regular guest on the Fox News Channel, 'The 700 Club' and Sean Hannity's radio show, as well as provides commentary on the Christian Broadcasting Network. In May, Sekulow dismissed the Russia scandal as 'a fraud on the American people.'
The aircraft involved in Wednesday's incident, a Boeing 737-800, was three years old and purchased from the manufacturer as new by Ukraine International Airlines, the carrier said in a statement. It had its last routine technical maintenance on Monday. A flight-data recorder from the plane has been recovered. … Though the Boeing 737-800 has not been flagged for issues, the newer 737 Max was grounded worldwide last year after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on March 10.
Meanwhile, government's activities have mushroomed, financed mainly by declines in defense spending. In 1960, military outlays represented 52 percent of the total federal spending. Now, they're 15 percent. In their place are health-care programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare), expanded Social Security, the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency and more.
Protect Our Care, a group formed in 2016 by top Democratic operatives to resist Obamacare repeal attempts, will launch a five-figure, health-care-themed ad buy this week targeting four senators and six House members considered to be vulnerable in 2020. The ad, provided first to The Health 202, paints the president as a hypocrite for promising during his campaign to save Medicare and Medicaid while proposing a budget to reduce spending for both programs.

Six days after tweeting he would be closing the border next week if Mexico did not immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States, Trump announced Thursday that he was instead giving Mexico a one-year warning before taking action.
House Democrats have proposed legislation to address drug prices, but it differs from that offered by Republicans and the Senate Finance Committee. Democrats chanted H.R. 3, a reference to the House bill, during Trump's address and tweeted Thursday after his news conference.
I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. It's not a theory for me. It's not -- it's not some -- you have to know how to put everything together. And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.
The police monitored Muslim students across the Northeast, even beyond the 100-mile radius, including the Muslim student associations at numerous colleges and universities in New York City and in New Jersey and other states.
Then came the rally in Dallas. Biden was as fired up as after his South Carolina victory and wielded his best new stump-speech applause lines: If Democrats want a nominee who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the NRA and gun manufacturers; protect our children; who'll stand up for the middle class, not raise their taxes and make promises that can't be kept, then join us, Biden said. If Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat ... then join us. We can either win big or lose big — that's the choice.
Second, Paul has a track record of bucking the Republican Party. He won his 2010 primary in defiance of the party establishment. While other Republicans criticized President Barack Obama for being too soft on terrorism, Paul often stood up for civil liberties. Yet Kentucky voters accepted his political heresies: In his first reelection campaign, he cruised through the GOP primary and increased his margin of victory in the general election. He has voted against the Trump administration far more than any other Republican senator, and he hasn't seemed to have any qualms about it — until, this time, his vote became the deciding one.
-- Ivanka, who now has an office of her own in the West Wing, is back from a week-long vacation. She will travel to Germany for an economic summit focused on women's financial empowerment. The White House says Angela Merkel invited her. Catherine Lucey reports: The W20 summit, a women-focused effort within the Group of 20 countries, will be held in Berlin in late April. Trump's plans are still being worked out, but she hopes to study successful apprenticeship programs during her visit. The meeting marked the second time foreign leaders reached out to Ivanka to coordinate an economic conversation. During Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's visit last month, she helped organize a meeting on economic development opportunities for women. That came together at the suggestion of Trudeau's office.
The new coronavirus appears to have a much higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu, possibly 20 times higher, but the outbreak was too new for a firm death rate to be determined. Moreover, it's a new virus, not yet a seasonal one, although it's possible covid-19 will become seasonal in the future.

Be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. (Even Trump's suspiciously rosy doctor's reports have put him on the borderline of obesity, and he made a still-unexplained visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in late 2019. However serious, he has clearly not been as healthy as much younger presidents.)
Both proposals fall short of the $1.9 billion requested by President Obama — but White House officials are less critical of the Senate figure.

Wisconsin Democrats interpret what's happening in a post-Ryan world differently. In contrast to Republicans, they have a serious candidate who has been in the race since June. Mustachioed iron worker Randy Bryce has already raised millions and received national attention with his pro-Affordable Care Act ads. He's arguably making a district that Donald Trump won by 10 points competitive. Wisconsin Democrats also feel the wind is at their backs after they won several state elections earlier this year they had no business winning.
Despite the resistance from some members, House Republicans can't get around the fact that for seven years, they have promised to repeal the Democrats' health-care law. As the pressure mounts, they're striving to just get the bill passed and let the Senate worry about how it could actually become law.
-- Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) will resign from Congress effective Jan. 13, more than a month after he pleaded guilty in federal court to misusing campaign funds. Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report: The six-term congressman is scheduled to be sentenced in March. He faces a maximum of five years in prison, although he is expected to serve less than one year. Hunter and his wife, Margaret, were charged in August 2018 with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including family vacations, theater tickets and school tuition. … Days after his guilty plea last month, the California Republican announced that he would resign from Congress 'shortly after the holidays.' The move meant he would collect one last full government paycheck, as House members get paid on the last business day of each month.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Axios on HBO there is an active conversation with the CDC about whether to require coronavirus testing for domestic flights. Pressed Monday in a CNN interview on the likelihood of that happening, Buttigieg said the CDC is looking at all its options.
Extend subsidies to marketplace consumers earning 400 percent or more of the poverty level, to ensure they don't spend more than 8.5 percent of their income on premiums. People at this income level currently aren't eligible for subsidies.
The senator's comments offered insights into the complicated relationship between two of the country's most powerful leaders — and into McConnell's particular challenge: to hold the GOP together through the tumultuous early weeks of Trump's presidency. While Republicans control both chambers of Congress as well as the White House, they have been sidetracked from their policy goals by Trump's all-too-regular controversies.
The president made no mention of several other parts of the health-care law that his administration has worked to undermine through executive powers.
In its first operation, the new Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement team arrested a 28-year-old Euclid, Ohio-based online dealer, as well as seven others, and seized weapons, computer equipment and 2,000 lethal doses of fentanyl. Before the team's formation, federal agents would dive into complicated investigations largely on their own, sometimes without realizing others were already on the case, the AP's Sadie Gurman writes. But the team has forged a new level of cooperation that its members say is critical in increasingly sophisticated darknet cases that combine tech savvy with old-fashioned drug dealing.
Referring to other countries as 'shitholes', she added later, is just not presidential.
[Trump guarantees protection for those with preexisting medical conditions — but it's unclear how]
RUBIO: All right, well, let's hear it big Donald.
With the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the next wave of candidates likely to announce Democratic presidential bids is far closer to the center than the wave of the past six weeks. Hickenlooper, who has been discussed as a potential president or vice president since he first was elected governor in 2010, is one of at least 10 candidates arguing that the party can't win by just exciting its base — and that if tacks a bit closer to the center, it can win in a rout.
--Cigna announced this week it's raising minimum wages for its employee to $16 an hour and improving retirement benefits for about 30,000 workers because of the tax overhaul passed by Republicans late last year, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The major health insurer said it will spend $15 million on higher wages, mostly for frontline employees, and invest $30 million in an additional 1 percent match to its 401(k) program.
Judging from his tweets, I would say that he has partly moved away from the health-care debate, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said in an interview. He seems more focused on terrorism, his dispute with the mayor of London, his recent foreign trip and his infrastructure package.
-- Trump has yet to address the mosque attack on his personal Twitter account, despite his rapid response to the radical Islamist attack earlier this month. Philip Bump writes: That Trump hasn't mentioned the attacks on Muslims in London isn't surprising, mind you. It took days for him to praise the two men who were stabbed to death in Portland, Ore., while defending Muslim women on a train. It took almost a week for him to speak out about the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas by someone who thought that they were Muslim. In one sense, it's odd that Trump hasn't tweeted condolences to the victims in London, given the criticism he's received for his slow response to the above attacks — but, again, it's not surprising that he hasn't, given his history. The broader question is why Trump remains uninterested in acknowledging such attacks.
Shulkin's moderate views on privatizing VA were among several differences he had with Trump, who said last week that Shulkin was dispatched because he wanted to give veterans more choices. Now Jackson's nomination could mean the privatization legislation will be pushed further back on the shelf, depending on how loyal the White House doctor is to the president in his likely new job. (For their part, a White House spokeswoman said following Shulkin's exit that no one is talking about privatizing the VA, per Politico).
This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.
Some conservative priorities could also pose problems for the budget reconciliation process, which limits the kinds of provisions that can pass by a simple majority vote.
On Sunday afternoon, Democratic candidates were genuinely wrestling with how to respond to the end of Robert S. Mueller III's probe of the Trump campaign. On Monday evening, all of that changed: The Department of Justice asked the conservative-leaning U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act. Literally overnight, the Trump administration had resurrected the health-care issue, the one that Democrats kept saying they wanted front and center in 2020.
Cruz should also have noticed that for all his loyalty to the evangelical movement, it is populated by many hucksters whose loyalty is sold to the highest bidder. Only a small segment of self-described evangelicals is concerned about social issues or a candidate's personal faith. Outside Iowa caucuses, the social conservative vote is not what it is cracked up to be. Building a political identity specifically to cultivate it — and at the expense of a much wider electorate — is an error.
The ideas have been adopted in the past year by the Democratic-led House but had no chance of becoming reality until the Senate and the White House shifted last month into Democratic hands. Now, the committee's plan — or something similar — is widely anticipated to become law, marking the first time since the ACA came into existence 11 years ago that the government would be adjusting the law's subsidies, which some policy analysts have consistently criticized as too small to be useful for some people struggling to afford health coverage.
According to the book, Walsh also observed that Trump had conflicting impulses and urges that required a lot of guesswork to translate into policy. Wolff quotes her as saying it was like trying to figure out what a child wants.
The commissioner said the move was part of the agency's efforts to address opioid-related deaths.
Steyer defended himself during his own CNN town hall last night. I thought it was the right thing, I decided it was the wrong thing and, 15 years ago, I sold it for moral reasons, he said. I came to the conclusion that everyone has come to conclude now, that this isn't a place to make money. Steyer added that he's sought to atone for his past investment by funding initiatives in California to get rid of private prisons. When I make a mistake, I correct it, he said.
Some conservative leaders say the tensions between Trump and the Freedom Caucus could be fleeting because the president may eventually need them to pass legislation in the coming months.
Northam ordered state flags lowered in his honor.
Trump's push comes after his Justice Department, in a filing Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, argued that the ACA should be thrown out in its entirety, including popular provisions protecting those with preexisting health conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health-care plans.
President Trump seems to have an obsession with size. From nuclear weapons to hand size, here are some of his relevant remarks:
It's a judgment call, and the attorney general is the person who makes the judgment, and that's what the job entails, Barr said.
COLLINS: And we were talking about it and what he was going to do. And all of a sudden he pointed to both of us and he said, You two are right. And it was then that I knew he was going to vote no.
This case is much worse than someone who falsely shouts fire in a crowded theater, said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), the lead impeachment manager. It's more like a case where the town fire chief, who's paid to put out fires, sends a mob not to yell fire in a crowded theater but to actually set the theater on fire.
11:15 a.m.: Barr says government must do a better job of stopping inflow of overseas drugs
The limits on vaccine supply bolster the argument that recovered people should let others go first.
--Yesterday, a patients' rights group announced a six-figure advertising buy through Feb. 7 to promote a bill aiming to lower drug prices. The group, Patients for Affordable Drugs NOW -- a new political action arm of the group Patients for Affordable Drugs -- said it's targeting Senate and House members in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, West Virginia and D.C. to vote for the bipartisan CREATES Act, which targets drug-company tactics delaying the entry of less-expensive generic versions of brand-name drugs from the marketplace.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted last night : The 'Not Guilty' vote is growing after today. I think most Republicans found the presentation by the House Managers offensive and absurd. The 'Not Guilty' vote is growing after today. I think most Republicans found the presentation by the House Managers offensive and absurd.
OPERATOR: And our next question will come from Anita Kumar with McClatchy Newspapers.
Not only is there no evidence of massive voter fraud, but there is no way Trump could possibly know this.
I know you said you want the investigation to continue, Stephanopoulos told Biden, referring to a probe by New York's attorney general into allegations Cuomo had sexually harassed several women. If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign?
NASA scientists may have noticed a wobble in Earth's axis Tuesday morning. Harry Reid, the irascible top Democrat in the Senate, had shown contrition.
ELIZABETH WARREN (D-Mass.): You remember what was at stake. This was about rolling health care back for millions and millions and millions of people. And we were a 48-52 Senate at that moment. The bill had already passed the House. And we all knew if it got even to 50-50, people were going to lose health care around this country, because the vice president would break the tie and roll back this health care.
A familiar face appeared at the White House, per a CNN reporter:
But the measure doesn't have GOP buy-in, including from Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the senator who tried to negotiate a bipartisan marketplace stabilization bill last year with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) only to see the whole effort ultimately crumble.
6. Who is key to keeping the 50 Senate Democrats together?
The ban had been put in place after officials in the county declared a state of emergency, announcing it would remain in place for 30 days or until unvaccinated minors got the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. There have been 167 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County as of Friday.
And I want to go back and do it again, and I'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from Washington galloping in. There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families. And I'm going to keep doing this.
But Kim Waller, voting in West Baltimore, said she chose Van Hollen because of his role in getting the president's Affordable Care Act through Congress. The 52-year-old bus driver said the issue was especially important to her because her grandchildren had spent time without health insurance after the death of their mother.
Prince Deigh, 57, sat at one of the tables in the food court with an array of cellphone parts and papers arrayed in front of him. Deigh would seem to be precisely the sort of American Trump was hoping to entice with his tax plan: A small businessman who in 2016 backed Trump's opponent.
While the U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to be influenced by a news conference, there is a patchwork of statutes on surrogacy in different states and lower courts have returned sometimes conflicting verdicts on the parental rights of surrogates, Ariana reports. Experts have said such cases raise critical constitutional issues that need to be addressed. Influential groups such as the Family Research Council and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists have urged the court to consider the issue.
That's an executive branch initiative, said McConnell, separating himself from Trump's controversial move to temporarily bar all refugees as well as foreign nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries. It's entirely up to them to decide what path to take.
But there are a variety of ways to put extra supply to use.
* NO, THE PRESS ISN'T GOING TO SHUT UP AND LISTEN: E.J. Dionne has a nice response to Bannon's insistence that the media is the opposition and should shut up and listen:
You cannot show up at our churches before Election Day singing the first and last verse of 'Lift Every Voice' . . . and call that post-racial and inclusion, she declared in her concession speech. When will our voices be effective, equal leaders in a big tent party?
The costs are going through the roof, at a time when our revenues are falling off a cliff, she told me. Unemployment insurance claims are skyrocketing, health costs are skyrocketing, and we have had to invent a lot of new social services to deal with the coronavirus fallout.
The Families USA Health Action Conference continues
That is in part because Republican candidates are likely to get peppered with questions about what they think of Trump controversies, she said.
Critics say that those neutral considerations seem to always lead Gorsuch to conservative outcomes, a criticism that was also leveled at Scalia.
Conventional wisdom says the Senate normally moves things left or more moderate, but this has been a year of the unexpected, said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity.

We could do so much with higher levels of Medicaid reimbursements, said Bruno, 38. We'd be able to explore much better models for providing care.
Obama's former acting solicitor general pushed back against Trump's attack on George Conway:
On his first day in office, Biden signed directives to reengage with the World Health Organization and opt into Covax, a multilateral effort to distribute vaccines globally. A national security memo released by the White House called for the secretaries of state and health to send Biden a framework for donating surplus vaccines, once there is sufficient supply in the United States, to countries in need.
The retired administrative assistant can recount decades of work for local and state Democrats' campaigns, printing candidates' brochures, distributing them at the polls and then hosting pizza parties for volunteers on election night. Her generation is used to hard political footwork, she noted.
All of this is notable because if there were anything that could turn that GOP-Trump rift into an un-crossable canyon, it would have been the Mueller report. There has been no greater threat to Trump's presidency than the investigation, which probed whether his campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election and whether he illegally tried to stop the investigation. When Barr shared in March that the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion, Democrats' hopes of a bipartisan turn against the president were dashed.
The campaign against those cheaper versions, known as biosimilars, could delay affordable access to a host of novel therapies, hurting patients and driving up health-care costs, Christopher writes.
Transit agencies are ramping up mask enforcement, as federal lawmakers raise concerns about the safety of transportation workers, Michael Laris reports.
To evaluate how these politicians deal with sunk costs, we presented them with a scenario in which an underperforming small business loan program run by the government is being considered for an extension and further budgetary commitment, although it hasn't recovered its original investment. We experimentally varied the size of the budgetary shortfall — the decision's sunk cost. We also varied the implied level of political accountability for the task — meaning that we either mentioned or didn't mention that the media is asking to know the respondent's decision, and that this is happening a month before an upcoming election. We then asked respondents to indicate, given what they knew, whether they would vote for the proposed extension and the additional investment.
President Trump never speaks the truth! said Imelda Barrett, 70, as we spoke on Wednesday. He's always lying. He says one thing and…
You may see people making jokes about engaging in online retail therapy to deal with the boredom, but don't buy into that, said Kelley Long, a member of the financial education advocates committee at the American Institute of CPAs. This is the time to brag about your frugality and prove to yourself how little you truly need to live on in.
KELLY: ... And, it involves veterans, and it involves teachers, and it involves so-called little guys, working class, and lower- working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced, who say that it was as scam. The class has been certified, and in that case you counter-sued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed.
Also essential: Programs that were time-limited in the rescue package, notably the big unemployment insurance increases, should be beefed up, extended beyond their current expiration dates and put on automatic pilot. They can switch off when economic indicators turn positive. The one-time payments in the original rescue should be delivered quickly now and authorized again.
The company has partnered with CVS Health, Walgreens, the Drug Enforcement Administration and state governments on the pilot program.
When I noted that Bloomberg lacks the kind of traditional foreign policy experience of someone like Joe Biden, who spent 35 years in the Senate and then eight years as vice president, he emphasized not just that he was mayor of the most international city in the world – as home to the United Nations – but highlighted his overseas business interests.
His approval rating has remained fairly stable since the deadly assault, too, NBC News's NBC News's Carrie Dann reported : A new NBC News poll found that 43 percent of voters nationwide gave Trump a positive job approval rating, just barely down from 45 percent who said the same before the November election and the 44 percent who approved of his performance shortly after he took office in 2017.

In contrast, the transition website says the Trump administration will modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation — and beyond.
One example of that appeal in Trump's press conference today. Early on, NBC's Peter Alexander called Trump out on his inaccurate claim that he had won the biggest electoral college victory of any president since Ronald Reagan. Well, I don't know, I was given that information, Trump responded. I was given — I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?
Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
The rest of the media has an establishment perspective, and we have a progressive perspective, Uygur said in an interview. It's very important, in a Democratic primary, that there be a conversation centered around that. I'm going to ask different questions than Jake Tapper is. He's going to ask questions skeptical of Medicare-for-all; I'm going to ask questions skeptical of the current system. That's already a massive difference. (In a town hall with Kamala Harris, Tapper asked if Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance; Harris implied that it would, partially reversing that position one day later.)
Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers. Polling director Scott Clement contributed to the Big Idea.
This law ignores long-settled precedent from the Supreme Court that a woman, not the legislature, gets to decide whether an abortion is the right decision for her and her family, Ken Falk, legal director with the ACLU of Indiana, said in a statement.
The Trump administration's plan was plagued by legal and operational problems, including a failure to get necessary clearance from the White House budget office, Dan writes.
Travis Smith has spent much of his adult life without health insurance. That hasn't really worried him over the years, and it doesn't bother him now — even though, at 32, he has a wife and two small children.
-- Syria and Turkey are inching closer to war after their troops exchanged deadly fire for the second time in days. Kareem Fahim and Sarah Dadouch report: The latest hostilities started after shelling by Syrian forces killed five Turkish soldiers and injured five others, according to Turkey's Defense Ministry. The deaths came a week after a previous round of Syrian shelling in Idlib killed eight Turkish military personnel. Turkey's response Monday included attacks on what it said were '115 regime targets,' including mortar positions, tanks and a helicopter. One hundred and one troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were killed, the Turkish Defense Ministry said.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which runs Medicaid and CHIP in the state, did not respond to specific questions from Stateline about the uninsurance rate among young children. It emailed a statement saying, HHS team members work hard every day to enroll and provide quality health care benefits for Texas children who qualify for the programs we administer in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
I think here is a recognition that this is not just an issue that you can keep shoving under the carpet and say this is something families need to deal with or that the private sector can fix it on its own, Mathur said.
OOF: The president's latest surrender on Obamacare, now saying he always intended for lawmakers to hold off voting on a health-care plan until after the 2020 election, is an acknowledgment from the Republican Party that the ACA is here to stay, our Post colleague Aaron Blake writes in this analysis.
I first encountered him as a 'fringe' candidate, but he's less fringe by the day, said Matthew Tomas, a 40-year-old data scientist. Tomas had driven four hours from Connecticut, listening to an audio version of Yang's policy manifesto The War on Normal People, to hear the candidate. He feels like a smarter, more successful version of me. I felt the Bern [for Bernie Sanders] in some ways, but Andrew is speaking more to the things that I see happening in our country.
The rule … does not provide the information patients need, lawyers for the AHA wrote. Mandating the public disclosure of negotiated charges would create confusion about patients' out-of-pocket costs, not prevent it.
Republicans argue that their bill would eliminate Obamacare's requirement that almost all Americans carry health insurance, freeing those who do not have coverage that is publicly provided or sponsored by their employer from the responsibility of buying policies that many feel are not worth the money.
-- Senate Republicans aren't likely to heed Trump's demand to abolish the legislative filibuster because it won't accomplish much. Paul Kane makes a good point: Their reluctance is not just some longing for the better, bygone days of bipartisanship, but also a recognition that Republicans have passed just about all they can on a simple majority. Senate Republicans are too divided to pass party-line legislation, whether on a border wall or the repeal of the [ACA], and instead need Democratic support to get just about anything done. All of that makes the 'nuclear option,' as the heavily partisan way of changing Senate rules is known, pretty pointless. There's nothing that they can't pass with 60 votes that they can pass with 51 votes.
Virginia, with its legislature under GOP control, staunchly resisted Obamacare expansion under McAuliffe, who had made expansion his marquee campaign promise.
Trump appeared at a closed fundraiser in Atlanta last month for Handel, but the candidate since then has seemed to distance herself from the president. During a fundraiser this week with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Trump's name was not mentioned by either Handel or Ryan.
It caught on, at least in Washington. The GOP-led House has now passed five annual budgets — theoretical policy statements, not actual changes of the law — that have endorsed a version of Ryan's Medicare plan.
Under the new policy, that would change.
Second is the challenge of getting the policy right and avoiding the pitfalls that come with deconstructing and then reconstructing such a big law over time. Gary Claxton, an analyst at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, compares Obamacare to a stool, in which the unpopular parts of the law are helping prop up the more popular parts.
Butaro is lifetimes away from the bustling cities that medical schools and their students gravitate toward — and hardly seems a place that would hold lessons for rich countries awash in high-tech medicine like the United States, Sarah writes. That's precisely why the university's founders picked Butaro. Most people in the world live in rural areas like this, eking out a living on meager sums. To bring them health care, the medical school staff here believe, you have to go where they are, immerse yourself in their lives.
You must have the integrity, the strength and the fortitude to tell the president no, regardless of the consequences, Feinstein said. So, my questions will be, do you have that strength and commitment to be independent of the White House pressures you will undoubtedly face?
Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and White House legislative affairs director Marc Short are fighting off a tide of discontent that has been exacerbated in recent days by President Trump's tweet that the Senate could simply repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it later if it cannot pass the pending measure.
Over the weekend, in a Biden-esque way, the former vice president accidentally said during a speech at the annual Delaware dinner for Democrats that he had the most progressive record of anybody running before correcting himself, -- of anybody who would run for president.
More to the point, the war on drugs is a prime generator of encounters between the police and these men, as much through officers assigned to search for drugs as men actually possessing or selling them. With no war on drugs, police officers would encounter Black men less frequently, as, meanwhile, underserved Black men who otherwise might drift onto street corners would, if there were no other choice, seek lawful work. Poor Black communities would turn a corner within a single generation, and the sense that America never gets past race would significantly lessen. (As we have seen in 2020, the poisonous relationship between Black communities and the police is the fulcrum of the race debate.) To make serious progress on this conflict would be as signature an achievement of a Biden administration as Obamacare was to the previous Democratic one.

It's a political fumble on the Republican part in the sense that this budget is going nowhere, he said. The argument prior to this was the Democrats' plan versus the status quo. And now it's the Democrats' plan versus the Republican plan to cut Medicare.

Trump Impeachment Trial Begins. Stocks Hit New High. If the headline sounds too good to be true, that's only because it probably is.
-- Internal White House battles spill into Treasury, by Politico's Ben White and Nancy Cook: The fight for the direction of [Trump's] presidency between the Goldman Sachs branch of the West Wing and hardcore conservatives is spilling into the Treasury Department, threatening Trump's next agenda item of overhauling the tax code. Conservatives inside and outside Treasury say the new secretary, [former Goldman banker] Steven Mnuchin … is assembling a team that is too liberal and too detached from the core of Trump's 'Make America Great Again' platform of ripping up trade deals, gutting the Dodd-Frank banking rules and generally rejecting 'globalism' in all its forms. The ideological divide has been brewing for weeks inside the White House as a result of appointing a raft of top advisers with radically different worldviews. The battle at Treasury is simply an extension of that brutal fight.
(2) This is a victory for the Affordable Care Act, no question. Obamacare made Medicaid expansion possible and, whatever you think of the efforts by the administration and Congress to chip away at the ACA, an expansion of this size suggests President Barack Obama's health-care legacy is on firmer footing than Democrats feared when they lost the White House, as well as their majorities in the House and Senate.
As they conclude: Trump is like a broken record of Pinocchios, incessantly repeating false and misleading claims that have been debunked. In this context, it bears repeating that an enormous majority of Republican voters trust Trump, rather than the news media, to tell them the truth.
If Congress is not ready to do something, your time working on it is not going to get you much, said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. Cote should know: He was a member of the bipartisan ­Simpson-Bowles budget-balancing commission and later recruited 130 corporate executives to a Fix the Debt campaign. Neither effort moved the political needle.
HOT ON THE LEFT: Trump supporter thought president would only deport 'bad hombres.' Instead, her husband is being deported, from Peter Holley: When Helen Beristain told her husband she was voting for Donald Trump last year, he warned her that the Republican nominee planned to 'get rid of the Mexicans.' Defending her vote, Helen quoted Trump directly, noting that the tough-talking Republican said he would only kick the 'bad hombres' out of the country ... Months later, Roberto Beristain — a successful businessman, respected member of his Indiana town and father of three American-born children — languishes in a detention facility with hardened criminals as he awaits his deportation back to Mexico, the country he left in 1998 when he entered the United States illegally. Supporters say the 43-year-old has never broken the law and doesn't have so much as a parking ticket on his record. 'I wish I didn't vote at all,' Helen Beristain told the Tribune. 'I did it for the economy. We needed a change.' HOT ON THE RIGHT: Mother Claims Her Four-Year-Old Was Suspended for Bringing a Shell Casing to School, from National Review: [A] preschool in Illinois suspended a four-year-old boy for a week because he brought a spent shell casing to school, according to a Facebook post by the boy's mother.
Barr said he held that view because in 1789, the Founding Fathers said the attorney general should provide legal advice to the president and his Cabinet. And if the president determined that he wanted to do something that was a reasonable construction of law — even if it was not what his attorney general might do — the attorney general should be supportive, Barr said.
-- Virginia's top three Democratic leaders face political scandals that could end their careers, and their responses have managed to only make matters worse. Paul Schwartzman explains: The nadir may have occurred when the governor, prompted by a reporter's question, appeared willing to perform a rendition of Michael Jackson's moonwalk at a nationally televised news conference during which he acknowledged putting on blackface to compete in a 1984 dance contest. But the cataclysm also has been punctuated and propelled by contradictory statements, untimely barbs and assertions that have seemed insensitive and hypocritical. ... 'Any one of these could be a case study for future analyses of how not to handle a political crisis,' said Mark Rozell, a George Mason University professor of public policy. 'In each case, their public comments have amplified the situation rather than tamped it down.'
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is pressing fellow Republicans to embrace a significant change to the ACA that would allow companies to offer minimalist plans on the private insurance market that do not meet current coverage requirements.
Which is why The Sarah Silverman Podcast, launched by the longtime comedian a few months ago with little fanfare and a sense of resignation, may be one of the sneakiest successes of the pandemic.
Keep the military prison at Guantánamo Bay open. (It's still open.)
Scrap the Clean Power Plan, which reduces the amount of carbon pollution from power plants. Trump says this could save the country $7.2 billion per year. (Just this week, a federal appeals court struck down the Trump administration's Clean Power Plan replacement.)
The hang-ups: Republicans are focused on raising the caps for military spending to give President Trump his requested increase of about $100 billion. Democrats are demanding a dollar-for-dollar raise on domestic spending, too. (Things like housing programs, Pell grants, and food and job assistance.) That could turn off some fiscally inclined Republicans, putting the whole spending bill in jeopardy.
Three major Senate confirmation hearings, a vote-a-rama, and the first news conference held by the president-elect since he claimed the Republican nomination nearly six months ago: Wednesday was business as unusual, with bureaucratic Washington adjusting to the age of Trump and to a newborn administration that seems poised to keep delivering news fodder by fire hose.
In Minnesota, for instance, the 2017 insurance premiums in the marketplace for individuals are increasing by 50 percent to 67 percent. In Arizona, the Blue Cross Blue Shield plan on the exchange is raising rates by 51 percent. Around the country, jumps of more than 20 percent are common.

The logic makes some sense, in the abstract. If Democrats are confronted with Obamacare being ripped out, root and branch, would they really not work with Republicans to restore funding to things like Medicaid?
All McConnell could do after making his decision was cross his fingers that Republicans would hold on to the Senate and win the presidency and get to fill the seat themselves. If not, he'd just risk losing the Senate, the presidency and the conservative balance of the Supreme Court.

After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. Please reconsider, I'll say no.
Walden said his two key priorities are to expand access to treatment and to try to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country. That's probably No. 1 – treatment, Walden said. No. 2 is trying to figure out how to turn off the illegal fentanyl, cause that's what is getting mixed in with the heroin.
Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.

The problem was that voters did not love this proposition.
African American turnout reached record levels, exceeding 2008, when Barack Obama first ran for president, and outnumbering white voters, according to exit polls. Yet the candidate who would have been Maryland's first black senator and the second black woman to ever serve in the U.S. Senate fell short.

From that perch, he brought down several major figures during Ronald Reagan's presidency. Among them: Justice Neil Gorsuch's mother. Dingell subpoenaed documents from EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford as part of an investigation into her handling of the Superfund program. After she refused to turn them over, she was cited for contempt and stepped down under political pressure.
Not all Republicans are convinced that those efforts will help. In an appearance on ABC's This Week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, warned against efforts to try to buy people off with little, last-minute fixes on issues such as opioid abuse programs that he called anemic. It's like spitting in the ocean. It's not enough.

When a lot of folks think about evangelicals they think of people who are tied to the administration, but they don't represent the evangelical community, said World Relief vice president Jenny Yang, who will co-chair this group's conversation along with Bishop Claude Alexander, a black pastor based in Charlotte. She later said she did not intend to imply that all of Trump's advisers do not represent evangelicals.

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.

A member of the president's coronavirus response team struggled to access a publicly available coronavirus map:
-- On the trail with Biden, this question arises: What happens when the electability candidate starts to lose? Ben Terris reports: There's a surreal feeling surrounding the Biden campaign's efforts in New Hampshire. … Maybe this is a strategic move by a candidate whose best play, for now, is to manage expectations. But how exactly are his people on the ground supposed to feel about that? Does anyone know what place they should be fighting for? … 'I'd be happy in the top three,' said Heather Ledoux, a registered nurse who turned her house in Litchfield into a canvassing staging area. 'Top four counts as a win,' said Bob Mulholland, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a Biden supporter. 'I'm not going to prognosticate,' former secretary of state John F. Kerry said when asked what would count as a success. 'You'll know it, we'll all know it, we'll feel it.' …
But those same Republicans are unlikely to convict the former president — and vote to prevent him from running again in 2024.
This is all a guess at best, said Blanchard, his anxieties kindling once again. In my head I'm wondering, should I start making this transition . . . and try to find a full-time position solely for the health care?
The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with. I don't think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we've undone that decision.

Ernst also was critical of the media coverage of female candidates compared to their male counterparts: Women are scrutinized much more than men . . . it's just ridiculous and we saw the same thing with [Hillary] Clinton. And I'm not a Clinton fan by any means but I did hate that the media focused on her pantsuits. Give us a break. I wish folks would focus more on the policy issues and understand that women bring some very powerful ideas to the table, Ernst said.
Esparza sees some Trump policies as reinforcing racist ideas. Trump's stupid wall with Mexico, he said, was a way of prodding xenophobia and catering to his base.

That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.
Sanders also benefited from a shift in opinion that he encouraged but did not invent: the growing disenchantment of younger Americans with capitalism in the wake of the Great Recession. The future of this country is with our ideas, he declared in his video from Burlington, Vt. While young people who vote in Democratic primaries are no doubt to the left of those who don't, he had a point. Americans under the age of 35 are the country's most progressive generation since the cohort that powered the New Deal coalition. Sanders gave them a voice.
What did he hear about the Democrats? They are obstructionists who are good at resistance. (This highlights one nifty feature of the Trump-Friends relationship: They often would echo his own rhetoric, sometimes by directly reading his tweets.) They're vulnerable; they're panicking. They're starting to turn on the Clintons. They're trying to regroup. They're pushing the Russia narrative. That black and Hispanic Americans are skeptical of the party.
Utah Republicans on the state Senate's Health and Human Services Committee voted Tuesday to recommend a measure creating a scaled-back version of Medicaid expansion — even though the ballot initiative specifically calls for people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level to receive benefits as generous as current Medicaid enrollees. There are also questions around whether CMS would even allow partial expansion, something the agency hasn't yet fully weighed in on.

Although the White House has not settled on a clear path forward, a partial strategy has taken shape on social media: going after the ideological purists who blocked Trump on health care. After dealing initially with the House Freedom Caucus with a carrot, Trump has settled on a stick, promising to fight Freedom Caucus members along with Democrats in 2018.
The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote, Rubio said on CBS' Face the Nation. So the first step in this may be crafted among a small group of people, but then everyone's going to get to weigh in.

Medicare-for-all solves that problem, she said. And I understand, there are a lot of politicians who say, 'Oh, it's not possible.'…What they're really telling you is, they just won't fight for it. Well, health care is a basic human right. And I will fight for basic human rights.
And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable. We get rid of all the taxes. We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. That's a 32 percent differential.
Sessions, in an unusual step, sided with plaintiffs who had argued the ACA was now unconstitutional because Congress, in the tax bill, eliminated the penalty for not buying insurance, known as the individual mandate. Sessions said the Justice Department would no longer defend the law in a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states, a surprise stance that led to the resignation of a senior career lawyer at the Justice Department.

What I can say is that Professor Dershowitz said last night that even if the president asked for the aid to be delayed for, you know, the fact that he wanted an investigation of corruption, that's not an impeachable offense, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) told Wolf Blitzer on CNN. Paul added that it doesn't matter if the investigation Trump demanded was into the Bidens or anyone else. They think that rules should be written, that OK, you're allowed to investigate corruption, you're allowed to withhold the aid for corruption, unless that corruption involves a Democrat, Paul said. No one could write a rule that way. That would be saying to the local Republican sheriff, you're allowed to go after crime, unless your Democratic opponent's son commits the crime.

Bosworth dismissed the idea that Russian efforts to manipulate U.S. voters over Facebook, a subject of extensive government investigation and journalistic scrutiny, were crucial to Trump's victory. Bosworth, who shared his post publicly after the New York Times published it, also played down the importance of the use of Facebook data by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign and boasted of its ability to target ads using psychological profiles of voters derived from their social media posts. Rather, said Bosworth, who ran advertising at Facebook for several years, Trump 'got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.' Bosworth, a self-proclaimed liberal who donated heavily to 2016 Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton, particularly praised Trump's leading digital-advertising adviser in 2016, Brad Parscale, who is now managing Trump's reelection campaign. …

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the defense of the health-care law, is holding out hope the Supreme Court might still decide to hear the high-stakes case this year:
Anyway, there are always new adventures to come.
The first is that the conventional wisdom about independents deciding presidential elections hasn't exactly held over the past decade or so. George W. Bush won reelection in 2004 with a strategy that focused meticulously on building and playing to Republican base voters. (Remember all those anti-gay-marriage initiatives placed on ballots in key swing states?) Bush wound up losing independents to John F. Kerry, 49 percent to 48 percent, but he still won a second term. President Obama's quest for a second term was similar. Rather than running away from his liberal accomplishments -- economic stimulus, Obamacare, etc. -- he embraced them, betting big on heavy turnout among Democratic voters. It paid off. He won easily despite losing independents by five points to Mitt Romney.
Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.
These opportunities come in the form of two budget reconciliation bills, which require only a simple majority to pass. Congress is allowed to pass one budget reconciliation per year, so Democrats will have this year's bill and next year's bill as vehicles.
McConnell, who has frequently complained about what he calls Democratic obstruction, on Thursday called their resistance to Trump's Cabinet picks a futile gesture.

I think his response was, 'I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII,' going down the list. There is no Article XII, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told reporters afterwards. It was the normal stream of consciousness that's long on hyperbole and short on facts.
Yet opponents say it would do the opposite by limiting opportunities for people to sign up for Medicaid. This population, while slightly better-off than traditional Medicaid enrollees, is less likely to have access to workplace coverage enjoyed by higher-income Americans.
A spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.
Lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and get rid of most corporate tax loopholes or incentives. Allow corporations a one-time window to transfer money being held overseas, charging a much-reduced 10 percent tax. (The corporate tax rate remains at 21 percent — although that's down from 35 percent.)
Trump made clear he had no problem with Flynn discussing the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Obama administration with the Russian ambassador even if he was not directly told to do so by Trump, saying it was Flynn's job to reach out to foreign officials.
In a pluralistic society, there has to be a live-and-let-live attitude, Barr continued. But he stressed that mutual tolerance . . . has to be a two-way street — meaning that there had to be an accommodation for religion in laws supporting LGBT rights.

Clever readers will realize that what Ryan is describing here is actually called insurance. First of all, the healthy and the sick aren't different people; they're people at different points in their lives. And the whole idea of insurance is that those who don't need it at a particular moment are paying for those who do. By Ryan's logic, homeowner's insurance is crazy, because those whose houses weren't destroyed by tornadoes are paying for those whose houses were destroyed. If you didn't get into a car accident this month, your insurance premiums paid to repair the cars of people who did. What an upside-down world we live in.

Some experts worry that the process of signing up for a vaccine — which may require quickly snagging an opening on a computer or waiting outside in the cold — may make it harder for some of the most vulnerable seniors, including those over 75, to access the vaccine.
Told through the eyes of Katie Walsh, then a deputy chief of staff, the factions broke down this way, Wolff writes: Bannon was the alt-right militant. Kushner was the New York Democrat. And Priebus was the establishment Republican.
Three major hospital groups -- the American Hospital Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges and America's Essential Hospitals -- are suing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to halt the planned cuts, which for them means major reductions in their drug reimbursements for Medicaid patients. But U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled Friday the hospitals sued CMS prematurely, since the proposed cuts weren't going into effect until Jan. 1.
This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate — some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
The response was similar after Congress's 1965 passage of Medicare, the federal health-care program for senior citizens – to which persons with permanent disabilities were added in 1972. Before Medicare passed, congressional debate was ideologically charged; its opponents alleged that the program would lead to socialized medicine. But once the law took effect in 1966, conservative resistance collapsed. There were no serious efforts to repeal Medicare or challenge its constitutionality. Similarly, Medicaid, which also passed in 1965, encountered little conservative resistance. By 1970, all but two states (Alaska and Arizona) participated in Medicaid.
Virginia's legislature staunchly resisted Obamacare expansion for four years under Northam's predecessor, Terry McAuliffe (D).
9:20 a.m.: With whom did Barr discuss his memo, and when?
Their worries persuaded the ACLU to agree to a month-long extension in the fight to stop the expulsion of migrant families.
Several Republicans staffers said privately this week that they wish Trump would hold more rallies and other events aimed at bolstering Republican leaders' efforts to advance health-care legislation and other key priorities. Instead, Trump has remained largely aloof save for stray remarks — such as his tweet calling for a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act — that have only made cobbling together votes harder.
The party's increasingly liberal bent is also creating dilemmas for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is trying to manage a band of outspoken new liberal members while also staying attuned to the needs of moderates hailing from swing districts that could be key to Democrats retaining the House majority in 2020.
Women in these states often lose their Medicaid coverage at the 60-day mark after giving birth. The new legislation would allow states to extend pregnancy-based eligibility for a full year — something they're not allowed to do currently without applying for special permission from the federal government.
Kansas' Democratic governor and a top Republican lawmaker on Thursday outlined a new proposal for expanding the state's Medicaid program, breaking an impasse that had allowed a handful of GOP leaders to thwart bipartisan legislative majorities. The plan from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning would give Kelly the straightforward expansion of state health coverage that she has advocated, covering as many as 150,000 additional people. But Denning would get a version of a program that he has proposed for driving down private health insurance premiums to make it less likely people would drop existing private plans for Medicaid.

This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
Together, the doses from all six companies would be enough to vaccinate 750 million people, given that all the vaccines other than Johnson & Johnson require two shots. Considering there are 260 million adults in the United States, that puts the United States way over the threshold needed to immunize the entire population who is eligible for vaccination.
And there are those who still feel deceived, with one woman in Tennessee invoking President Barack Obama's promise that people would be able to keep their plans and doctors going forward. The first day of the ACA I was notified that my insurance was canceled, she wrote.

Tennessee is one of few states to decline Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which has left thousands without insurance. Republican officials have touted the new model as an alternative that will help reign in cost.
The Fifth Circuit's decision itself does not warrant immediate review because it did not definitively resolve any question of practical consequence, Francisco wrote.
Conservatives fought so hard to stop the ACA from getting through in the first place because they understood just how hard it would be to claw back, no matter how problematic or expensive the law turned out to be. Their fears are now coming to fruition, as the debate over Medicaid's future increasingly threatens to imperil the House GOP bill.
To these hospitals, they're pioneering a promising new era of medicine, one that is centered on evaluating and delivering care to the patient when they need it versus forcing patients to accommodate physicians' often crowded schedules.

Fink, in his annual letter to more than 1,000 global chief executives, signaled his firm wants to see the tax cuts produce more than just stock buybacks or dividend payments. What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use it to create long-term value? Fink wrote. This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors.
That became less likely as the moderate wing of the party moved rapidly to coalesce behind former vice president Joe Biden after his South Carolina win over fears that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the front-runner so far, is gaining unstoppable momentum. But Biden's push to make this a two-person race isn't guaranteed, and the party is still fractured enough that there could very well be a muddled picture and continued infighting moving ahead.

AHIP wrote that if left to stand, the judge's ruling, would undo scores of reforms that have reset the American public's expectations about the availability and scope of health care coverage.
Of course, it would never occur to Trump that his own behavior might have had something to do with the fact that Ryan broke with him (finally, after months of racism and hate).
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal's (D-Mass.) bill calls for the Department of the Treasury to create an online portal where Americans can update their information to claim the credit.
Additionally, experts say, the IRS is likely to struggle to reach the millions of families experiencing changes in child custody arrangements because the agency lacks current information about family status. Democrats' plan calls for sending the monthly benefit to parents who had custody of their child for more than 50 percent of the preceding year.
-- Kamala that-little-girl-was-me Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joe Biden to boost her standing in the veepstakes. From the New York Times: Such a move could lift Mr. Biden's campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris's chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California. An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial … She and [Biden] have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.
Now, we are in a crisis of democratic legitimacy: A president who has plainly abused his office and broken the law, a legislature too paralyzed to do anything about it — and a chief justice coming face to face with the system he broke.
Yet recent evidence suggests anti-opioid medications aren't widely available. Even though buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone have all been found safe and effective, most people who could benefit from the treatments don't get them and they're not typically made available in residential treatment facilities, according to a report last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
Week 1376, add a character to a Shakespeare play
Many aren't, with many federal attorneys and judges likely to remain out until the end of the impasse, leaving their cases waiting.
The House health care plan allows Virginia to work with the Trump Administration to expand Medicaid while guaranteeing common sense reforms to control costs and protect taxpayers. Do you support or oppose this plan? voters were asked.
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also asked Barr whether he would continue to defend the administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census — a change that a federal judge ruled against Tuesday, likely sending the matter to the Supreme Court.
Twitter mocked Bryce Harper's short-lived record:
For the crisis that has shook us — beg to differ? Kiss my tuchas!
The 387 cases have emerged from outbreaks in 15 states, including New York, California, Texas and Washington, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. There were 372 reported cases in all of 2018.
SPEAKER: I'm Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant Ronnebeck, 21 years old. Killed January 22, 2015 by an illegal immigrant who shot him in the face. I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things. He's going to fight for my family, and he's going to fight for America.
Maybe he just decides: 'Hey, Paul Ryan really wants to do this. . . . Maybe there's a way to make this a winner,'  said Rohit Kumar, a longtime aide to Hill Republicans who now works for the firm PwC.
We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts -- we're not running a surplus in Ohio. But, you see, what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn't come. Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise. They don't understand policy...

-- Japanese voters in Okinawa rejected a referendum to build a new U.S. military base on their island. Akiko Kashiwagi and Simon Denyer report: Okinawa is home to about half the 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and houses the largest U.S. air base in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. military says its presence on the island is vital not only for the defense of Japan, but also for keeping peace in the region. But Okinawans say their small island bears an unfair burden of the U.S. military presence in Japan, and on Sunday, they made their resentment felt. The results showed that 72.2 percent of voters rejected the construction of a U.S. base at Henoko, in the north of the island. The turnout was over 52 percent.
No other president has amassed such a record of pro-life victories. But Trump has done more than simply govern as a pro-life conservative; he has embraced pro-life conservatives without shame or hesitation. Want to know why so many Republicans don't care about Trump's ham-handed phone call with Ukraine's president or his personal moral failings? Because he is an ally like no other in the fight to save innocent unborn lives.
It could complicate the process as health providers are already struggling to get the vaccine distributed quickly. So far around 6.7 million people have been vaccinated, even though 22.1 million doses have been distributed, according to a Washington Post analysis.
But Trump has boxed several of his Hill allies into a lose-lose situation that could spark a primary opponent and/or a bruising campaign either way, even in solidly red areas:
In his own statement, DeMint called the critique puzzling, saying the board had praised his work for the past four years and approved annual performance bonuses for the entire management team.
As he opened his testimony, Barr read nearly verbatim from written testimony the Justice Department released Monday. He vowed to let the Mueller probe finish and said it was important Congress and the public be informed of the results.
If the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the move would halt the lawsuits so Purdue Pharma could negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the direction of a bankruptcy judge, Reuters's Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Nate Raymond report.
We want to work with you to improve what's working and fix what's broken – not start over, writes the group, which includes America's Health Insurance Plans and Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America. We urge you to oppose single payer health care solutions and work with us to ensure the best of the free market and the strength of public programs can deliver real solutions that lower costs, increase patient choice, and improve quality.
Biden's acting drug czar is emphasizing treatment and harm reduction in combating the opioid epidemic.
Giuliani has been promising for a while now to release said evidence. It has not been forthcoming, so take such claims with more than a grain of salt. The president's lawyer also said for months that he was going to release a lengthy report rebutting former special counsel Bob Mueller's findings on Russian interference and whether Trump obstructed justice. He never did.
— State lawmakers in Hawaii have proposed a bipartisan bill that would ban cigarette use for everyone except people 100 years and older. The bill looks to slowly phase out cigarettes in the state almost entirely, except for centenarians, by 2024, our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports.
Committee staff confirmed at least three of 57 bills passed in committee that are expected to get votes next week. They include measures from Reps. Bob Latta (R-Ohio), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) aimed at improving doctors' access to patients' history of addiction, giving the National Institutes of Health new authorities to research responses to the opioid epidemic and creating a public database tracking federal efforts to stop the crisis.
Expand the number of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers so that more of the talented people who graduate from Ivy League institutions can stay in the United States and work in Silicon Valley. (Trump tightened rules for these, although he at other points said he would restrict them.)
Trump made three contributions totaling $5,600, in excess of the legal limit at the time, prompting the McCain campaign to refund $1,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Every country we lose money with. As far as I'm concerned, we've got to reduce -- we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent. I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it. We will make...
The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.
On Capitol Hill, the comments produced a collective yawn. McConnell told reporters in Kentucky that we are going to stick with that path, nodding to his ongoing pursuit of passing a Senate GOP revision of the House's passed bill. And administration aides at the Department of Health and Human Services had already told lawmakers that such a proposal was off the table. House and Senate Republicans had briefly considered the idea in February but rejected it as unworkable.
After reaching a peak of 6.2 percent during 1995-96, the multiple job-holding rate began to recede, the BLS noted in a report. By the mid-2000s, the rate had declined to 5.2 percent and remained close to that level from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, the multiple job-holding rate decreased to 4.9 percent and has remained at 4.9 percent or 5.0 percent from 2010 to 2017.
GOP leaders are still tweaking their health-care plan to attract more votes, especially from centrists. McConnell is prepared to preserve two of the Affordable Care Act's existing taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 annually and couples earning more than $250,000 for several years, according to multiple Republican lawmakers and aides briefed on the plan. One is a 3.8 percent tax on investment income, and another is a 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax on wages and self-employment income.
I joined Chase McGrath, 18, on one of his door-knocking shifts. He just graduated from high school and will attend Georgetown this fall. Walking down streets lined with pine cones and red dirt in Roswell, he urged these targeted voters to take the time to turn out for Handel. Canvassers for CLF had previously knocked on many of these doors twice. This was the final push to drive them to the polls. There's a lot of people who are just ready for the election to happen, McGrath said.
If the facts require us to initiate removing the president, we are obligated to do it. If the facts don't support it, we won't, said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who sits on Judiciary and is a leadership member, told Politico.
President Trump lashed out at late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) on March 19. (The Washington Post)
Trump's weakness (one of them) is his gigantic ego, which never permits him to accept blame, error or imperfection in himself. At bottom, this is a hopeful, optimistic country which is why — you got it — we can do better.
-- New polling released by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling shows that the House bill is deeply unpopular in three states with GOP senators who could torpedo the legislation: Alaska, Nevada and West Virginia.
Republican campaign committees and super PACs spent $10.7 million to help Saccone, more than five times as much as their Democratic rivals, according to Federal Election Commission records filed Monday night.
-- The bottom line: If Handel loses tonight, it will be almost entirely because of moderate unease with Trump and his agenda. The Journal-Constitution poll found that only about one-third of voters in the district approve of the president. Even one in four Republicans give him an unfavorable review.
Calling the gun violence epidemic the problem of our time, Barr called for improvements in state gun laws that would help authorities detect people with mental illnesses to ensure they don't have access to firearms.
A noose was found on the gunman's locker at a Milwaukee Coors facility years before his shooting rampage there last week. Current and former employees of the Molson Coors brewery here say there is a long-held culture of racism, including racist cartoons placed in workspaces, the n-word scrawled in break rooms and bathrooms and nooses hung at the facility — one on the locker of an employee who killed five co-workers there last week, Annie Gowen and Katie Zezima report. While police have not provided a motive for the Feb. 26 rampage, they said in a statement that, based on a preliminary investigation, neither race nor racism played a role in the shooting.
Health 202: That sounds like pretty much a nonstarter with Republicans in the Senate.
We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the legislative process, the letter read, and we are steadfastly committed to ensuring that this great American institution continues to serve as the world's greatest deliberative body.
Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ha said there would be no vote in the Senate on a Republican health-care plan ahead of the 2020 election. Mulvaney acknowledged McConnell's stance.
The FDA said the byproducts would not have been detected in routine inspections. But David Light, chief executive of Valisure, an online pharmacy that chemically validates drugs before sending them to consumers, told Carolyn: The manufacturers know, or should have known, about the contamination. Common precision tools exist to analyze these contaminants, and there are standard procedures for getting rid of them.
Cecilia Muñoz, a former domestic policy adviser to Obama, said Biden faces a minefield on immigration policy, but he still needs to find a solution.
Health economists — and the health-care industry, for that matter — are hotly debating the impact of President Trump's controversial new requirement for hospitals to post prices online. Yesterday was the deadline for submitting comments on the proposal to the Department of Health and Human Services.
All of them, so far, have avoided the pitfall of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who started this line of attack last summer. Ocasio-Cortez, at the time a novice politician who had just won her primary, went way too far and earned Four Pinocchios.
People have to come forward and get tested, Sommers said. Getting referred by seeing doctors or nurses who say, 'Yep, this is a patient who is at risk and needs to be tested' — that doesn't happen when someone is scared to get health care because they can't afford it.
Trump has fixated on the health-care vote since it occurred. Amid a spate of tweets over the weekend, the president called it a stain on McCain's record and later took another swipe at him, falsely asserting that he was last in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis.
Andrew Yang: You are correct. I apologize.
The lawsuit targets just one type of procedure the company offers, a fat-based therapy that involves extracting a patient's belly fat, mixing it with an enzyme to break down the tissue and spinning the mixture in a centrifuge to isolate mesenchymal stem cells, which can morph into a variety of cell types. Those cells are then injected into patients' spinal fluid, bloodstream or joints.
We've been here before, said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. The only difference is now we have a Republican president, and some people thought the fever might break a little bit. But apparently not.
So while many drug policy experts have praised the administration's proposed rebate ban as a strong first step, it wouldn't by itself solve the problem of drug prices in the United States.
George W. Bush, in Reid's telling, was a loser and a liar who betrayed the country. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was a hack and a fraud, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas an embarrassment, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff incompetent, his own aides fat, and the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission unethical, prevaricating, a treacherous miserable liar, a first-class rat and a tool.
But board trustee Bill Walton said the issue was not Needham versus DeMint.
The Trump administration has said Americans need more choices than Obamacare, saying the cost of individual coverage offered on public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act is too expensive for an increasing number of people, Bruce writes. But Trump's short-term health plan ideas have yet to gain much interest in health plans' public disclosures and statements to Wall Street analysts.
They had a productive discussion with the doctor on national medical priorities that need to be addressed in our country, as well as innovation in the areas of medicine.
The consequences? Falling confidence in government, and a growing perception that Washington had become a swamp corrupted by political money, fueled Trump's victory. The Republican Party, weakened by the new dominance of outside money, couldn't stop Trump's hostile takeover of the party or the takeover of the congressional GOP ranks by far-right candidates. The new dominance of ideologically extreme outside groups and donors led lawmakers on both sides to give their patrons what they wanted: conflict over collaboration and purity at the cost of paralysis. The various decisions also suppress the influence of poorer and non-white Americans and extend the electoral power of Republicans in disproportion to the popular vote.
-- Federal employees' retirement benefits would also be cut. In some cases, the benefits would reduced only for future retirees, but in other cases, those already retired would face cuts as well. The budget also proposes a 1 percent pay increase for federal employees while recommending a 3 percent raise for military personnel. (Eric Yoder)
The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.
Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and former congressional aide, said Republicans' inability to forge consensus on health care shook the party to the core.
* Hillary Clinton: The former secretary of state was, as always, solid. And, at times — like in her closing statement on the water in Flint, Mich. — she was outstanding. Her knowledge — both the depth and the breadth of it — is on full display in these debate settings.
The program intends to test the idea that the best approaches to combat the drug crisis are well known but poorly implemented and coordinated and will involve doctors, treatment providers, law enforcement, courts, churches and housing providers in a system, for example, in which these groups work in tandem to offer continued support for substance abusers to try to avoid repeated relapses.
At her appearance in Davenport, Warren gave a lengthy answer when asked whether she supports the Green New Deal resolution, saying that she's gratified to see so much attention focused on climate change but steered clear of some of the specifics in the proposal.
And Charlotte Bennett's attorney says there are more accusers: There are more women with sexual harassment allegations against Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York who have not come forward publicly, an attorney for one of his accusers said on Tuesday, Politico's Benjamin Din reports.
Honestly, I don't think big business matters much anymore, said William Daley, a banker who served as commerce secretary in the Clinton administration and chief of staff in the Obama White House.
Trump's attack Sunday had the look of a coordinated effort.
That's fine … it shouldn't surprise anybody that we're not going to get to this before the 2020 election, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be talking about it — and we will, he said.
Anybody who is a moderate-wage worker who just experienced an economic lockdown in their state is in distress. Most people don't have savings, said Robert Rector, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that guides much of the Trump administration's policymaking.
— Jan. 21, remarks at the CIA
Barr made the statement in response to a question from Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) about when he might have his Jim Mattis moment of breaking with the president so fiercely on policy he might contemplate resigning. Mattis is the former defense secretary who announced his resignation late last year amid disagreements with the president.
Vindman remains assigned to the White House, something that has drawn the continuing ire of pro-Trump commentators. Schiff thanked senators last night for keeping an open mind about all of the issues we are presenting. But, after Schiff spoke, Senate Republican leaders privately expressed growing confidence that they can win the vote next week to block additional witnesses from being summoned to testify. It's not clear whether Schiff's calls for courage have pushed any Republican senators toward breaking with the president and their party leaders on the key votes coming up next week surrounding summoning witnesses or subpoenaing documents.
Biden was asked about his remarks to wealthy donors at a recent fundraiser, in which he said that nothing would fundamentally change for them under a Biden presidency. What did Biden mean by that?
I think I'm advocating a system, a barrier system, in some places, and I'd have to find out more about the situation since I last visited the border, he said.
Expediency was both the rule of the day and the fear of it, as committee members attempted to vet would-be appointees, some of whose nominations had been controversial. Tillerson was the country's would-be chief diplomat, with no political experience. Sessions was the country's would-be chief attorney, whose appointment had been protested by civil rights groups. Less than 18 hours before, news had broken that the president-elect had been briefed on unconfirmed claims that Russia had gathered compromising information about him.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) offered a word of support to protesting teachers:
-- During their raid on Michael Cohen's home and office, FBI agents seized tapes of conversations between Trump's former attorney and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who oversaw Trump's inaugural festivities. Vanity Fair's Emily Jane Fox reports: According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration—about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump's adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: [Rick] Gates and [Tom] Barrack. These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million.
D.C. being D.C., I also happened to encounter a former Clinton campaign staffer on V Street. He, unsurprisingly, still supported his former boss.
Instead, let me suggest a screamingly simple explanation for both the Moore nomination and the anti-Obamacare move. It's that Trump would much rather play offense than defense — something that's obvious to anyone who's been watching him from afar, as I have.
-- A super PAC supporting Senate Democrats announced that it raised $61 million last year. The Senate Majority PAC haul is more than twice the amount its Republican counterpart reported raising in the same time, which is wild because the GOP controls the majority. (Michelle Ye Hee Lee)
After another question about Trump's call for a voter fraud investigation, Thune simply said, We've moved on — the election's over with.
The U.S. needs to be a leader in the global health arena, he said. The void is being filled by Russia, China and India.
On Monday, Cruz's campaign sent supporters a video tribute to itself, with footage of the operative, spokesmen and volunteers who gave the better part of a year to him. There's even a shot of Rick Tyler, the well-liked spokesman who was asked to leave the campaign in February after he shared a video of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that had been misleadingly labeled to make the senator sound as if he was attacking the Bible.
Things did not look good for Obamacare that July. The House had already passed a repeal bill and the Senate seemed on the verge of doing the same. On a critical procedural vote about whether to let the bill move forward, Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) had the courage to vote no. But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) disappointed supporters of the law by voting yes to continue the debate while giving a heartfelt and acidic speech about the shortcomings of congressional politics.
KELLY: ... Hold on, Senator, hold on...
-- Joe Biden, facing scrutiny of his foreign policy record, sharpened his criticism of Trump's incompetence on Iran. Matt Viser reports: Biden, blasting [Trump] as 'dangerously incompetent' for his handling of the crisis with Iran, said Trump's 'impulsive decision' to order the killing of a top military official from that country put the United States at risk of greater international conflict. … Biden's comments were striking for someone who has spent much of his political career with a reputation as a foreign policy expert who has often embraced American use of power in the world. As a senator, he voted in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq — a vote that has become a point of contention in the Democratic race as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) presents himself as the true antiwar candidate in tune with rising public skepticism of drawn-out military intervention. … Biden's toughened rhetoric on Trump and Iran on Tuesday seemed designed to present Biden with a more nuanced position — more sharply critical of Trump's decision than his previous comments but not as black-and-white as Sanders's stance.
Political control R Reagan R Senate D House Why it happened Congress attached several measures to the funding bill, including a crime-fighting package, water projects funding and a civil rights measure. Reagan offered to sign a bill without those, but a deal wasn't reached in time. How it was resolved Congress passed a three-day funding extension to continue negotiations.
But in the letter, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin S. Kneedler, a career department lawyer, said the government no longer adheres to that position.

Their recommendations would require more funding from the federal government to subsidize private plans. But the list doesn't include this: a government-backed public option plan — a key way Biden has proposed to expand coverage options. That idea is fiercely opposed by most health insurers and medical providers, who dislike the idea of competing directly with the government, given it can unilaterally set lower prices and payments.
I will say, though, the H1N1, that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu. And that went from around April of '09 to April of '10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it's over 13,000. I think you might have said 17,000. I had heard it was 13,000, but a lot of deaths. And they didn't do anything about it.
The Solomon-like strategy is an attempt to calm fears of Republican governors in expansion states that abolishing the 2010 law would cost them hugely, while also satisfying new demands for equity from other GOP governors who opposed the expansion. ­Details of how the plan's dual elements would be implemented, including their specific time frames and funding totals, are still coming together in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Confirmation hearings for Becerra aren't expected to start until the week of Feb. 15 and could be pushed even later.
-- Unpopular elements of the Ryan plan are also getting additional scrutiny from health care reporters: Employers could impose hefty penalties on employees who decline to participate in genetic testing as part of workplace wellness programs, Lena Sun reports, to cite just one example. In general, employers don't have that power under existing federal laws, which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination.
In media interviews after his ouster, Shulkin blamed his removal on forces that would benefit from a diminished government health-care system for veterans.
Even if reforms like these bring us lower prices and higher quality drugs, it won't mean much for patients who can't access them. For the more than 28 million uninsured Americans, medicines are often entirely out of reach — a problem that would be exacerbated by Trump's Obamacare repeal efforts. And even for those who are insured, drug co-pays and deductibles force difficult — and unnecessary — choices between filling prescriptions and paying for other necessities.
The last Republican majorities denied oxygen to Democratic bills and resolutions and prevented breakaways such as the 2018 attempt to force an immigration reform vote that wasn't supported by GOP leadership. One result was the biggest Republican electoral defeat since 1974, with endangered Republicans unable to point to many substantial votes against their party.
— In an op-ed in USA Today, drug-pricing expert Ted Slafsky expressed skepticism that lawmakers would be able tackle anything ambitious on the issue of prescription drug prices but acknowledged that there's new momentum for change. Slafsky, former president and chief executive of 340B Health -- a group representing hospitals and health systems -- suggested that requiring list prices in television ads, allowing direct government negotiation of drug prices, issuing drug coverage restrictions, weakening drugmaker monopolies and allowing people to buy drugs from other countries are possible future areas the new Congress may tackle.

But the CEOs of more than 60 health systems are arguing the new rules would be overly burdensome for providers and could endanger patient privacy, according to a letter provided to Health 202. They want Azar to narrow the regulations and give them more time to comply.
In the last two years, we've embarked on an unprecedented economic revival. Unprecedented.
-- New this morning: EPA regulator skirts the line between former clients and current job, by Juliet Eilperin: Less than a month into his tenure as the top air policy official at the Environmental Protection Agency, Bill Wehrum hopped into the EPA's electric Chevy Volt and rode to the Pennsylvania Avenue offices of his former law firm. There, he met with representatives of the nation's largest power companies — including two groups that, shortly, had been his paying clients — to brief them on the Trump administration's plans to weaken federal environmental regulations. The Dec. 7, 2017, meeting is just one example of interactions between Wehrum, a skilled lawyer and regulator, and former clients that ethics experts say comes dangerously close to violating federal ethics rules.
While Trump likes to brag about how he can get people elected, that was more true in Republican primaries during his presidency than in contests against Democrats. Data from Ballotpedia shows that Trump-endorsed candidates won about 86 percent of their primary contests and 69 percent of their general-election matchups.
And you stay in your domain.
Again, I look forward to seeing you -- so many of you in person tomorrow and I hope you have great day. We are down to the -- to the final few hours here. I know we're excited and look forward to -- to Friday.
And it creates a corrosive beggar-thy-neighbor dynamic. Case in point: the tension in Nevada between Sanders and the big dog in Nevada Democratic politics — a 60,000-member casino and hotel union, the Culinary Workers. The union's excellent health plan, attained through collective bargaining, would be erased if Sanders-style single-payer became law.
-- The contents of the Senate bill remain tightly under wraps, which defies tradition but could establish a new norm if it works. Amber Phillips reports: There are always some kinds of closed-door negotiations on big pieces of legislation. But at this point in the 2009-2010 debate for the Affordable Care Act, there had been months of public committee hearings that you and I could attend or watch online or read about in the news. Senators had been briefed on what was happening and could answer reporters' questions instead of saying they have no idea what's in the bill. Amendments were offered by both sides. But if the bill makes it through despite the secrecy, that would be a remarkable change in the way legislation is debated and passed. And it would be a very tantalizing path for both sides to take in the future.
The allegations of misuse of funds extend from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2019, spanning both Obama and Trump administrations.
Biden came into office intent on reversing Trump's approach. He owned the crisis, releasing a 200-page national strategy that outlined, for example, exactly how the government would use its powers and resources to ramp up vaccinations. That included ordering millions more vaccines; using the Defense Production Act to ensure that additional production could happen fast; enlisting the armed forces, National Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies to support vaccination sites; and shipping vaccines directly to pharmacies, thus creating another network of vaccination centers across the country.
Here's how Democrats reacted to Friday's health care vote:
Week 1366, neologisms containing the letter block LIAR
Mike Bloomberg's commercials are breaking through:
The software checks to see if patients have contributed to charities or to political campaigns, and some hospitals train doctors and nurses to have patients who express gratitude for their care contacted by hospital fundraisers.
Biden is laser focused on the Palmetto State because he recognizes that failing here would functionally end his campaign. He hopes to ride momentum from a victory on Saturday to success in the other Southern states with large African American populations that vote one week from today on Super Tuesday. Reflecting his limited financial resources, Biden is not airing television ads in any of the states that vote next week.
The White House asked Congress for an emergency $1.8 billion to bolster the response.
Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.
Arkansas's governor signed a near-total ban on abortion into law.
This is not normal policymaking, and this is potentially a political nightmare for Republicans. They spent seven years promising to do what they can't seem to do. They are now more than six months into controlling all of Washington, and their efforts to reform health care are more secretive, messy and unpredictable than Democrats' 2010 efforts to pass Obamacare were.
As an asthmatic, McCreary already has large health bills. He's also been cautious about returning to the classroom until he has been vaccinated. His grandmother died of covid-19 in July.
It's going to take us a while to get out of this backlog that we're in, but we're doing the things necessary to help more consumers, Chris Herrick, the department's associate commissioner, told the Texas Tribune's Jay Root and Shannon Najmabadi.
He's traveling aggressively to states that vote in March. He landed in Virginia at 4 a.m. on Tuesday after a redeye on his private jet from Los Angeles, where he had a late dinner after attending an opening for one of his 10 field offices in California. After visiting Richmond, he flew to New York in the afternoon. He dropped by his foundation's office to pick up mail, stopped by his house to drop off a jacket that a button had come off so it could be sewn back on, went to his corporate office to sign a couple of papers and then headed to his campaign headquarters, where he called me. He planned to leave home around 6 a.m. today for the flight to Illinois.
Many involved believe it will be several months before the market starts to settle and availability will become much more widespread. The regulations will, in many places, continue to be tweaked, Katie writes. In some places, when business owners ask cities about their cannabis regulations, there are no answers.
-- Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) played with blue and purple fidget spinners. These are popular toys for children. In contrast, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who will potentially cast decisive votes on witnesses, almost never moved from their second-row desks. Collins is a furious note taker, while Murkowski just stares intensely at the speaker, Paul Kane reports.
We're trying to work in every state — even in the toughest places to expand access, the group's Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens told reporters. By the end of this year, we will take this offensive fight to all 50 states.
The bigger cities : Manchester, The state's largest city is arguably also the most important — a blowout here is a solid indication of who will win; Concord, It's a good spot to see where pro-establishment, middle-of-the-road voters are breaking; Nashua, The most diverse city in the state, only about 82% white as compared to the state's 94% white.
I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.
But when it comes to some critical decisions, such as how tough to get on Russia, or whether to get super tough on immigration, or how much federal money to spend on things like infrastructure reform, or whether to slap tariffs on imported goods, Trump increasingly looks like he's on an island within his own party.

Blackburn isn't backing down and tweeted another attack around 8 p.m. Trump himself retweeted her this morning. The senator, who won Bob Corker's seat after he retired in 2018, has also accused Vindman of being a handler for the whistleblower who filed the complaint. Vindman testified before Schiff's committee that he spoke with an intelligence community official about Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he declined to identify the official on the advice of counsel because he said he didn't want to blow someone's cover. But no public evidence exists that he was a source for the whistleblower.
— Members of the Senate Finance Committee debated skyrocketing prescription drug prices in a hearing yesterday, vowing to summon pharmaceutical executives before them in the future. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.) noted in opening statements they invited several pharmaceutical executives to testify before the panel, but all but two declined.

Ryan appears to still be very excited that he has a Republican president — it's topped his wish list since he suddenly became speaker in the fall of 2015. And he's not trying to hide the fact that there are some rifts between him and the president he got. Look, we don't all agree on everything. I think people kind of know that, Ryan acknowledged Thursday.

— The search for a permanent head of the Department of Veterans Affairs appears to be narrowing. Two retired generals under consideration for the role visited the White House in the last week to interview for the job, the Wall Street Journal's Peter Nicholas reports.
Could it be he's got a case of TDS?
Trump's budget would transform the structure of Medicaid and cut spending on the program by hundreds of billions of dollars on top of the GOP health-care plan's hundreds of billions in cuts to the Medicaid expansion over 10 years. This would chop down the program by nearly half. It's hard to know how many Trump voters would be hit by these cuts, but judging by Kaiser's polling, we're talking about a lot of them.
If the Senate can't get it done now, I don't see how they're going to get it done later, said Paul Ginsburg, a health policy expert with the University of Southern California's Schaeffer-Brookings Initiative, because the bill is just not very popular with the public.

OOF: The Trump administration missed a deadline last fall for providing critical grant information to local agencies, but officials insisted yesterday there will be no gaps in service in the country's $260 million family-planning program, the AP reports. While the grant funding is expected to run out at the end of March, the Department of Health and Human Services said it is still committed to the program, which helps about 4 million women every year by distributing grants to qualified health-care providers around the country (including Planned Parenthood for services like birth control and preventative medical care).
-- House Democrats started hearings on a plan to obtain Trump's tax returns. Jeff Stein reports: A House Ways and Means Committee panel brought in several experts in tax law to discuss the impact of a provision in Democrats' anti-corruption bill that would compel presidential candidates to release 10 years of tax returns within 30 days of receiving their party's nomination. The provision would apply to Trump, but Republicans oppose the measure and are expected to have the votes to block it in the Senate. … The subcommittee was not expected to take action Thursday to specifically seek Trump's tax returns, but the hearing was part of its broader push to lay the groundwork for a potential request, with lawmakers expected to ask about their authority to request the records.
Nearly 50 years ago, Lewis Powell, a big-firm lawyer in Richmond, had a dream: What if American business took over the then-liberal Supreme Court and turned it into a defender of capitalism and large corporations? Powell set out his ideas in the summer of 1971 in a confidential memorandum for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, with a bombastic title: Attack on American Free Enterprise System. Within months, President Richard Nixon appointed Powell to the court, and he helped bring about the pro-corporate transformation he had called for in his memo.

A federal judge on Monday directed federal and state officials to answer the questions of Costa Mesa, Calif., residents about their plans to bring Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus but show no signs of illness to a closed ­mental-health facility in the city, Jeff Rowe and Yasmeen Abutaleb report. District Judge Josephine Staton cautioned that the city — and Orange County if it joins the effort — does not have veto power over state and federal quarantine decisions and faces an uphill battle trying to block the transfer of people from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.

Meanwhile, Democrats are embracing these calls. They think it's going to be a 'gotcha' moment, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), lead author of a Medicare-for-all bill. But they have been wrong on this and continue to be wrong on it.
Last year, Congress succeeded in eliminating the law's penalty for individuals who do not obtain insurance. The Trump administration has also used its executive powers to try to unravel the law — for example, by proposing to allow insurers to sell skimpy plans that lack Obamacare's consumer protections.
Just before the Obama administration left office, HHS published an updated version of the report, which said 61 million to 133 million (23 to 51 percent) of non-elderly Americans have preexisting conditions. The difference in the numbers depends on the definition that is used. The more narrow definition is based on eligibility of state-run high-risk pools that predated Obamacare — which might reemerge as an option under the GOP plan for people in a waiver state and a lapse in coverage. The broader definition includes health conditions (such as arthritis) or behavioral health disorders (such as substance abuse) that might have resulted in denial of coverage or higher premiums.
But he can afford to lose only two votes from the pool of 52 GOP senators, with all Democrats united against it and Vice President Pence ready to break a 50-50 tie.

When enrollment in the ACA's insurance marketplaces opened in fall 2013, it had been two decades since Rick Woosley had seen a doctor. Not only did he feel pretty healthy, but as a tenant farmer raising cattle and growing crops such as corn, beans and tobacco, he also didn't exactly have the money to buy health coverage.
And the confirmation battle was equally bruising for Biden. Conservatives were outraged about the treatment of Thomas, a feeling that has only worsened with time, and liberals thought he did not do enough for Hill.
Nor did that mean that everyone who voted for Clinton did so enthusiastically.
Several people in Trump's orbit are eager to make bold changes to reduce the government's role in the health-care system. That camp includes Vice President Pence, who told conservative activists last week that America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end … Other White House advisers, according to multiple individuals who asked for anonymity to describe private discussions, have emphasized the potential political costs to moving aggressively. That group includes [Jared] Kushner, NEC Director Gary Cohn, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.
Behind the scenes, the administration has made clear in emails and court records that it is gearing up for a much broader influx at the border.

According to the annual 2016-2017 report Planned Parenthood released last month, the group provided less contraception, fewer cancer screenings, fewer prenatal services and less miscarriage care compared to the year prior. While the numbers ticked slightly upward on well-women exams and sexually transmitted-disease testing, the group's clinics are providing significantly fewer health services in nearly every category compared to five years ago.
I have two thoughts on that.
— On the anniversary of the shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed 17 lives, the White House released a statement from the president offering his condolences and referring to tremendous strides the administration has made toward protecting students from school violence.
The problem is that the GOP has pledged for years and years to repeal the law, and failing to do so would represent a massive unkept promise to their voters. At this point, they've backed themselves into a corner where they need to do something about the law yet aren't comfortable doing so without a replacement (because of the potential for chaos). And as the Democrats' own experience on passing health-care reform showed, that second part is just not an easy thing to do.
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Ky.): He's pretty much a contrarian in a lot of ways. I mean this is a man who doesn't suffer fools gladly and who has a temper.
To some extent this is inevitable when a president runs for a second term. Reelections are referenda on presidents' first term. However, by saying he's already reached his goal (making America great), Trump is telling voters this is as good as it gets. He's telling them, contrary to many of their own experiences, that the status quo works. That sounds like, well, like Hillary Clinton in 2016. The obvious rejoinder for Democrats or Republican challengers would be America Can Do Better. That has two meanings, both of which should help challengers.
Trump echoed the nationalist mantra of President Andrew Jackson, saying he would focus entirely on rebuilding America and promoting its interests.
Weeks of early, politically damaging battles over controversial policies and an ongoing probe into his campaign's ties to Russian interference in the election also have left Trump with the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in his administration since such data was first collected, during Harry S. Truman's presidency. Most of the right-wing Republican House members in the Freedom Caucus, now in the president's crosshairs, outperformed him in the 2016 election, giving them little incentive to cooperate.
This morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on its piece of the $1.9 trillion relief bill moving through the House. The legislation includes a short provision (it's only a sentence long) saying states, for a length of five years, can extend Medicaid eligibility to women for 12 months after giving birth.
And second is that the fact that, you know, when we talk about this $12,000 a year, that's $12,000 that Ivanka Trump and $12,000 that Jared Kushner are going to get. The idea that this is not focused on the people who are actually bearing the brunt of all the changes you're talking about, I think, is a real puzzle for a lot of people. And I'd like to hear you discuss why that isn't a defect in this plan.
Indeed, a statutory crime has never been required for impeachment, dating back to the 14th century, when the British Parliament invented the procedure as a mechanism for dealing with abuses of royal power. The American framers wrote 'high crimes and misdemeanors' into the U.S. Constitution, he noted, to include noncriminal abuses of power, and since then, federal judges and a U.S. senator have been impeached for noncriminal conduct.
HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley told The Post the Arkansas governor had spoken with department officials but said no appeal decisions have been made yet.
Eminent domain battles ahead:  . . . as the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on the declaration — and Trump readies his veto pen — legal experts say that even if the president gets his way, a variety of legal issues could delay wall construction for years and even derail it entirely, the Texas Tribune's  Even under an emergency declaration, they say, a president doesn't have free rein to take land for a border wall — partly because, according to several experts, the declaration makes the legal questions surrounding land seizures even murkier.  . . . as the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on the declaration — and Trump readies his veto pen — legal experts say that even if the president gets his way, a variety of legal issues could delay wall construction for years and even derail it entirely, the Texas Tribune's Kiah Collier and Arya Sundaram report
It doesn't sound very different than the accusations they have made throughout the first four years, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said about the TDS defense offered by Trump's lawyers. Yes, we are very focused on Donald Trump, more so than perhaps prior presidents because we think he has done more to destroy the country and imperil our democracy than anyone in office before him.
Oct. 9. During the second presidential debate, Trump said he would ensure that coverage for preexisting conditions was retained: When we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep preexisting, we'll also be able to help people that … don't have money because we are going to have people protected. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep preexisting.
Obviously, Trump would never acknowledge that his unpopularity is why his party lost an election. So it shouldn't be surprising that the White House is already telegraphing plans to blame others if Handel goes down. Inside the West Wing, Trump and his advisers have paid increasing attention to the race and have been briefed regularly on Handel's standing in private polls, GOP ground efforts and early-vote totals, Bob Costa reports. Associates of Trump — who have said he is already furious over the focus on his handling of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election — warned that an Ossoff win could spark new rage toward Handel's campaign and the way the GOP handled the race.
Esparza, like all of those we spoke with, said he'd vote for Clinton again. Like Smith in Manhattan, though, he went further.
But the people most likely to support political aggression were those who reported more aggression in their everyday lives. Among those in the top quarter of aggressive traits, 10 percent wished death on disloyal partisans, while 4 percent of the rest did. Aggressive traits also increased support for out-party harm.
As with most of the people who I approached in the places I visited, Murray had supported Clinton over Trump. Unlike many, she seemed more defeated than angry.
Leonard Leo told me he disputes the notion that the Constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. The Constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. And there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … You're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.

Right now, I'm somewhat optimistic we're going to succeed at that, Kreidler said.
But none of that will be possible unless Democrats can deliver on their promises. If they let themselves be handcuffed by the filibuster, the Biden presidency will fail and Republicans will take control of Congress. In other words, Democrats will have done the job Republicans couldn't do themselves.
I have a very strong core. But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible, who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility. You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.
Trump used to loudly criticize his predecessor for golfing too much -- but now, the White House has been forced to defend his own frequent outings:
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.
Here, right is supposed to matter, Schiff told senators last night in the 10 p.m. hour, wrapping up day two of his case against Trump, which he will conclude Friday afternoon. It's what's made us the greatest nation on Earth. No Constitution can protect us if right doesn't matter anymore. You know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country. You can trust that he will do what's right for Donald Trump. He'll do it now. He'll do it for the next several months. He'll do it in the election if he's allowed to. This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.
About half of seniors have yet to receive a single shot of a coronavirus vaccine.
When I ran for office, I pledged to stand for life, and as president, that's exactly what I have done, Trump declared. Today, we have kept another promise. My administration has proposed a new rule to prohibit Title X funding from going to any clinic that performs abortions.
Big insurers, however, entered the marketplace in Tennessee:
Federal contractor Janice Morgan, who works for Unispec, had her insurance coverage canceled during the shutdown, and she worried when she wasn't able to fill the prescription for the $7,600- per month medication for her husband who has multiple sclerosis. Wesley McClure, Unispec's founder and president, told the Post that before the shutdown, he hadn't missed a payroll or had to terminate insurance for his employees in 15 years.
The ACA means health care coverage for 800,000+ more people in WA, Gov. Jay Inslee tweeted. Trump is attacking our health care again. We've stopped them before and we'll stop them again.
Pelosi calls Trump 'insensitive' to shutdown's impact
Keep the Cadillac tax in place? Keep Medicaid in place until 2020? Jordan said Monday. We didn't have Medicaid expansion in the bill we sent to President Obama, but we have it in the one we send to President Trump? That makes no sense to me.
As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know — Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?
But even if GOP voters choose unwisely in 2016, it is still important for conservatives to do the hard work of crafting a policy agenda that addresses the frustrations of voters — Republican and Democratic — and that communicates that the right understands those frustrations and wants to help. This agenda should employ conservative principles and dispositions to address the realities of the 21st century and the needs of those who live in it.
Bitcoin, the digital currency created in 2009, is dismissed by many as the domain of geeks and speculators. But bitcoin and its underlying technology will have as much impact on finance as the Internet has had on commerce and journalism. Much of the promise of bitcoin is its ability to make the banking system more inclusive.
I think this trial will tell us about what the GOP wants to be going forward, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Donald Trump did not just drop out of the sky. Everything that he represents has its roots in earlier iterations of the Republican Party.
She adds experience suggests voters, despite their complaints about the health system, often react negatively to proposals for sweeping change, possibly because of uncertainty about what would follow.
It would do it in a way that would have serious, adverse consequences for all agencies that are involved in the administration of justice, especially the Department of Justice, Barr said. I wanted to make sure that before anyone went down this path, if that was in fact being considered, that the full implications of the theory were being thought out.
Having recently converted our single-family house back into a two-family, my husband and I are the envy of our town.

They're dividing the blame for premium hikes between the high medical costs of marketplace customers, which have been a problem from the beginning, and congressional Republicans' move to repeal the individual mandate to buy health insurance. Haltmeyer said he's very concerned the Trump administration doesn't do anything to destabilize the market as we go toward this next enrollment period.
If companies think they're going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they're going to pay a 35 percent tax, he said.
Trump immediately settled into the job, beginning a series of executive actions designed to systematically tear down Obama's legacy. He signed one executive order pertaining to the Affordable Care Act that White House press secretary Sean Spicer said would ease the burden of Obamacare as we transition to repeal and replace. Separately, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus planned to issue a memorandum to all federal departments and agencies ordering an immediate freeze on regulations.

The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed the industry's image in Washington, where large health care systems have long been vilified as corporate profit mongers instead of community caregivers. Now, more than two dozen lobbyists and consultants told STAT that they are keenly aware of just how much power the industry has accrued — and are prepared to seize the moment, Rachel continues.
Over the weekend, the administration said the pandemic has prompted it to consider opening a special enrollment period for private health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration, congressional Republicans and GOP-led states have been trying for years to repeal.
Charles Gaba, who runs a website devoted to ACA analysis, reacted this way, writing: You have the Trump Administration talking out of both sides of their mouths with a split tongue: 'The ACA sucks and is horrible and needs to be repealed! Also, the ACA is awesome and doing great!'
The bill also reduces the amount of federal money available to help those in the middle class pay their premiums. The cuts would be particularly steep in places where Trump's appeal is strongest.
It was not communicated in a systematic and effective way, Collins told our colleagues, adding the reported incidents signal the agency is erratic in complying with the relevant 2011 HHS policy. We need to straighten that out, he said.

That practice was common before Obamacare. Patients with common chronic diseases — such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers and Alzheimer's — often paid more. Mental disorders, obesity and past pregnancies could result in steeper premiums, too.

Framing his ascension as transformational and global in its impact, Trump delivered a dark inaugural address in which he pledged fealty to all Americans. But he made little overt attempt to soothe a nation still wounded from arguably the ­ugliest election season of modern times and signaled that he intends to govern as if waging a permanent political campaign.
One is thing is apparent: Trump's doesn't seem to be a hypochondriac, at least not publicly.
Saying no is easy; leading is hard, he said.
They could be mirror images of each other, flipped upside down. UPMC started out in the hospital business, then created its own health insurance plan and built a $20 billion-a-year enterprise. Highmark, which reported $18.2 billion in revenue last year, announced in 2011 that it would branch from insurance into hospitals, Carolyn writes. In response, UPMC threatened to stop accepting Highmark insurance at its doctors and hospitals.
When Timothy Berners-Lee conceptualized links in 1989, about 40 percent of Americans who were alive in 2019 hadn't yet been born. It took a few years to catch on, but by 1993 the New York Times was celebrating the new technology that emerged to exploit links, a browser called Mosaic.
Biden is facing a border challenge as migrant families arrive in greater numbers and groups.
What Ryan had figured out was that the same tax cuts he had always wanted would suddenly get laudatory coverage if he said they were part of a plan to rein in the debt. But there was never any doubt which one mattered more to him. Which is to say, that while he really did want to slash social insurance programs like Medicaid, this was always in the service of further tax cuts. That was clear enough from the way he voted against the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles debt plan, which would have cut Social Security quite a bit, because it also would have closed enough tax loopholes to raise more money even with lower tax rates. Or how his plan to repeal Obamacare would have plowed the vast majority of its savings into, you guessed it, a tax cut for top earners rather than paying down the debt.
KASICH: Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don'ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.
The Biden administration should prioritize forceful leadership at the United Nations, reviving fealty to the liberal values that inspired the organization's founding. Washington has always been equivocal about the United Nations; at their best, U.N. members have rallied to vanquish the Taliban and repair the ravages of natural disasters. More often, though, the organization hosts great power tussles laced with rancor and ending in impasse. At a time of taut stalemate among world powers with sharply divergent aims and ideals, the United Nations is more apt to mirror those tensions than resolve them. The Trump administration's malign neglect squandered U.S. influence at the U.N., leaving the forum diminished.
The win by the states is a rare bit of good news doled out by the Trump administration, which has steadily been chipping away at the regulatory framework underpinning Obamacare, which President Trump has called a disaster.
We urge the court to grant the people of Indiana a hearing on these landmark pro-life laws, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that works to elect antiabortion women to public office. The cruelty of abortion runs contrary to who we are as Americans.
The ACA required insurance companies to offer plans with reduced deductibles and co-pays for lower-income Americans with the understanding that the federal government would make up the difference. Insurance companies do not make money through the cost-sharing provision, estimated to be worth about $7 billion in fiscal 2017. They're being paid back for money they've already spent. When Trump stopped the payments, companies responded by raising premiums, mainly in the benchmark silver plans.
They then turned into a driveway and stopped. That's where Wright got out, screamed at the congressman and struck the windows of his vehicle, even reaching inside the car, the sheriff's department said.

There's an obvious recent spike in the number of family units arriving at the border — groups that include members of an immediate family. During the period that the family separation policy was explicitly in effect last year — from April to June, shaded on the chart below — the number of family units apprehended at the border remained fairly constant. (There was also an uptick in unaccompanied minors in May, which the separated children effectively became when removed from their parents.)
America deserves better, the people deserve better, and nobody — regardless of their position — is above common decency and respect for people that risk their life for your life. When the president is saying that that he doesn't respect John McCain and he's never going to respect John McCain and all these kids are out there listening to the president of the United States talk that way about the most decorated senator in history who is dead it just sets the worst tone possible.
This budget makes very clear the difference between Democrats and Republicans, Schatz said. Republicans are all about tax cuts and paying for it by cutting health care.
BAIER: Senator Rubio, three weeks ago you said, quote: I don't do the personal attacks, primarily because it's not who I am, because I think it's beneath the office that I'm seeking but also because I don't want to embarrass my kids.
In an interview with Reuters's Yasmeen Abutaleb and Susan Cornwell, Yarmuth said a majority in the party wants to do something, some kind of Medicare expansion. I've had a number of major corporate CEOS say to me we need to go to Medicare for All. Yarmuth cited a goal of getting some kind of legislation passed by the end of next year and told Reuters it may be practical to pass a bill allowing people to join Medicare as early as age 50 or 55.
But Trump's dark warnings pose a central conundrum for his reelection effort: Can he win the White House a second time by railing against the very problems he promised to fix?
Some plans are making their initial rate filings based on the assumption that the current situation will continue, but are hashing out alternate worst-case scenarios in case there are material changes over the coming months.
Frequently use the term radical Islamic terrorism. (This was a mainstay of Trump's public comments, although others in his administration eschewed it.)
The United States and China have the single most significant bilateral relationship in the world. It's not just a foreign policy problem, strictly understood. The U.S.-Sino relationship includes diplomatic, human rights, military, trade and technology concerns — to name a few. And as China has grown more assertive over the past several years, the necessity of a unified, strategic view of how to interact with it has grown.
Senators in both parties have shown support for raising the federal minimum wage, and the Senate should hold an open debate and amendment process on raising the minimum wage, separate from the COVID-focused reconciliation bill, she said.
Children are born; children age; you get divorced; the child is living with a different parent — all that stuff changes all the time, and is what makes the child tax credit very complicated, said Gleckman.
That reckoning has seen political, cultural and economic institutions publicly acknowledge the depth and breadth of systemic racism and the need to finally eradicate white supremacy in American society. But politicians, corporations and celebrities publicly admitting that Black Lives Matter, while an important first step, is not enough.
Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of Supreme Court justices for the annual affair. There's also a trio of Trump's once and future Justice Department leaders: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (alumnus of the Federalist Society's Harvard Law School chapter), recently fired attorney general Jeff Sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker (recommended by Leonard Leo to be Sessions's chief of staff). It's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the Justice Department are minor actors compared with the Federalist Society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.
The campaign rejected the notion that Trump is not serious about working to solve the nation's immigration woes. The president declared a national emergency at the nation's southern border and issued the first veto of his presidency when Congress passed legislation to overturn that declaration. He has instructed the State Department to cut off aid to three Central American countries that are the source of many migrants, though many experts believe that could make the situation worse. And, the campaign argues, Mexico has begun cracking down on caravans of migrants passing through in response to the threats from the president.
8 a.m.: The 'obstruction' memo that Barr might have a hard time explaining
Warren's supporters want big, structural change. Klobuchar's audiences desire a return to normalcy, a pitch that previously pulled many of them toward Biden. I really want someone who can help the country take a pause to breathe and to heal, said Susan Varn, 69, a retired consultant who lives in Exeter. I'm less in the Elizabeth or Bernie camp because I think they want to do too much too soon when this country has been traumatized and needs to recover.
Hollis thought four years ago that Clinton would be a wonderful president, but she said none of the candidates in 2020 particularly excite her. Sometimes it takes a devil to catch the Devil. It takes a thief to catch a thief. Sometimes it takes that. And I'm not sure we have that on the platform right now, she said.
At a White House briefing Wednesday afternoon, Sanders said Trump only had one brief conversation with Wolff and that most dialogue with White House staff was coordinated by one person: former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, whom Trump dismissed in an unusually harsh statement, saying he has nothing to do with me or my presidency.
He doesn't blame Paul Ryan, Priebus said on Fox News. In fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House.
It is a measure of how mercurial Trump is that many are now puzzling how he plans to back out of the mess he's made. With Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declaring the reaction overblown, it may take outside intervention from his Wall Street pals to figure out a way to contain the damage. (Sounding like Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was widely criticized for saying the bonuses workers were receiving were crumbs, Ross declared: People talk about cars. There's about one ton of steel in a car, and the price of a ton of steel is $700 or so. So 25 percent on that would be [a] one half of 1 percent price increase, on a typical $35,000 car. So it's no big deal. Maybe $175 is no big deal to him, but it may be as much if not more than any tax savings a working class family receives. (If that family has to purchase health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, his Trump tax — health-care increase plus tariffs — could well exceed his tax cut.)

Assuming there was no good cause? Barr clarified, then added, I would not carry out that instruction.
Over the past year, Trump has sought repeatedly to take credit for bringing down pharmaceutical prices in the United States where they're higher than anywhere else. He's tweeted frequently about the issue – sometimes even trying to predict industry moves in advance – and last month hauled Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top officials to the White House to express frustration more progress wasn't being made.
Biden listened with a smile as Swalwell spoke. In his response, he talked about education.

The irony is that TV (and TV news) started as a medium of moving images. Chyrons are about text and type and headlines. They're a throwback to a pre-TV age, when people read — not watched — the news.
FEARS OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPREAD: The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus rose to six on Monday, and patients were being treated in at least 15 states, deepening fears about the outbreak's rapid spread and the medical, psychological and economic toll it will exact on the United States, our colleagues Maria Sacchetti, Arelis R. Hernández, Siobhán O'Grady and William Wan report.
Molly Roberts: I have a few questions about getting into the guts of those Internet harms or device harms, starting with privacy, for which I think you've proposed what people call data ownership.
The Senate Republicans narrowly voted to debate the House bill. They are spending the next few days in a kind of amendment free-for-all to dramatically change the bill they just voted to debate. No one knows for sure what those amendments will be. No one has had time to understand the full financial impact of these amendments. No one knows if any of these proposals will pass. And almost all of them would radically change the health-insurance markets.
At a news conference, the team of Chinese and international researchers said they found that the virus was spreading in Wuhan during December 2019 both inside and outside the Huanan Seafood Market. That suggested the market was not necessarily the original source of the outbreak, Gerry and Emily write.
But some epidemiologists, including Frieden, argue that distribution is a bigger problem than supply at this point. Although he said he supports releasing most vaccines, he worries that some of the debates about how to stretch supply are distractions from the real obstacles of administration, which he blames in part on a lack of a coordinated federal plan for getting shots into arms.
Many of the ideas, including the conscience clause for health-care workers, mirror the positions of the Heritage Foundation. Edwin Feulner, the conservative think tank's former president, has a prominent role in the transition for domestic policy. So does Kenneth Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state who is a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and serves on boards of other conservative organizations.
5. Doesn't a filibuster last only as long as a senator keeps talking?
But he'd turned out to be worse than I'd ever dreamed.
One thing's for sure: We've heard that promise from Republicans many times before. And it's less likely than ever before they'll follow through on it.
At the time, the GOP held 52 Senate seats. As they tried to garner enough party support for an ACA replacement, the whole thing hinged on keeping a handful of moderates on board. In the end, the Senate failed to pass even a skinny repeal bill when three senators — Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and, famously, John McCain — opposed it.
A district judge in Texas agreed and said the entire law must fall.
This means veterans could — not will, as Pelosi says — lose tax credits if the current protections don't carry over under a new health law.
Others see court challenges as inevitable, noting that the drug industry has been willing to sue the administration over policies it opposes; it recently won a lower court victory against an HHS regulation that would have required drugmakers to include the list prices of their medications in television ads.
--As the end of government funding looms on Thursday (yes, this is happening again), Senate leaders were working yesterday to finalize a sweeping two-year budget deal that would include a defense spending boost Trump has long demanded alongside an increase in domestic programs Democrats are insisting on, The Post's Erica Werner and Mike DeBonis report.
American families are suffering from the ongoing and staggering price hikes of insulin, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said at yesterday's hearing.
There's been conversations about potential travel and for whatever reason or another there have been other priorities or crises that have occurred, he added.
The surveillance claim by itself would be worthy of Four Pinocchios, but overall Bloomberg's spin merits Three Pinocchios.
The House had told the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit decision poses a severe, immediate, and ongoing threat to the orderly operation of health-care markets throughout the country, casts considerable doubt over whether millions of individuals will continue to be able to afford vitally important care, and leaves a critical sector of the nation's economy in unacceptable limbo.
But the coronavirus vaccines are more complex than the AIDS drugs decades ago, and some experts say that loosening up patent restrictions would do little to increase global supply. They argue that the vaccines require close cooperation between developers and manufacturers and that bottlenecks in raw materials are a bigger concern than intellectual property limits.
Minnesota, traditionally a blue state, has trended Republican in recent years, and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won it by just two percentage points in 2016. Democrats, however, thought they would be able to use Pawlenty's post-gubernatorial career as a conservative presidential candidate and bank lobbyist as a way to convince Minnesotans their former governor was out of step with the state.
Mr. Biden did not urge unity at the expense of principle, or in service of some bland policy agenda. His welcome reference to the right to dissent and disagree as perhaps this nation's greatest strength, in no way denied that he, too, would fight for what he and those who voted for him believe in, including long-postponed action to stem climate change and uproot systemic racism. He called out white supremacy by name and pledged to defeat it. Whereas four years ago, Mr. Trump launched a bizarre lie exaggerating attendance at his ceremony, Mr. Biden demanded adherence to truth.
Trump repeated a version of this statement on March 5 and March 6.
The good thing about this policy is we have the ability without jumping through a lot of hoops to change our enforcement prioritization based on the data we are getting in, Hahn told Laurie.
Azar, 50, will take over as policies in the sprawling department, with its budget of more than $1.1 trillion, are tilting to the right, Amy writes. A new civil rights division has just been created to protect health-care workers who refuse to provide contraception and other services inconsistent with their moral or religious beliefs. For the first time, new rules allow states to impose work requirements as part of their Medicaid programs.
The inspectors also found bins full of shredded documents, including quality-control records, in parts of the factory where every piece of paper is supposed to be saved, Anna writes. A warning letter, the FDA's strongest rebuke, was drafted. It would mean the agency could refuse to consider any Mylan application for a new drug made at that plant until the company fixed things.
Far from advancing their case for removing Trump, Democrats have convinced more Americans that he deserves a second term. Before the 2018 midterms that put Democrats in control of the House, just 41 percent of the country said Trump should be reelected; today, after the Democratic House's failed impeachment effort, 50 percent want to give him four more years. Since impeachment began, Trump's standing with the voters has improved by almost every measure.
Perhaps we will come to accept that the search for answers is an endless but noble pursuit. And, finally, poetry just might give us the means to articulate, with deep precision and empathy, the complexity of our world. These disciplines can't teach us how to be kind, but they can help us understand why kindness is a virtue. Robin Givhan is The Washington Post's senior critic-at-large.
During a closed-door luncheon for all Republican senators, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) delivered a slide presentation offering choices on how to structure Medicaid, tax credits to help people pay for insurance, and ways to stabilize the insurance marketplace and bring down the cost of premiums, according to Republicans familiar with the closely-guarded session.

Thirty-six states have governor's races next year. Two states — Virginia and New Jersey — are holding contests this year.
I like Tom, but politicians sometimes are not the ideal people to be running big departments, Tom Miller, a health-care fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told me, adding that Azar is a smart lawyer who doesn't do things that blow up in his face.
You really don't want to know, he said.
While we sometimes disagree on important issues in health care, we are in total agreement that Americans deserve a stable health care market that provides access to high-quality care and affordable coverage for all, they wrote.
The idea of a new working group, which top administration officials discussed Friday in the White House Situation Room, represents a modified version of an earlier plan to establish a federal advisory panel on climate and national security. That plan — championed by William Happer, an NSC senior director and a physicist who has challenged the idea that carbon dioxide could damage the planet — would have created an independent federal advisory committee. The Federal Advisory Committee Act imposes several ground rules for such panels, including that they meet in public, are subject to public records requests and include a representative membership. The new working group, by contrast, would not be subject to any of those requirements.
We're going to have insurance for everybody, Trump said. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us. People covered under the law can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.
It was hurtful, Harris said. She said she didn't think the former vice president was racist. But she criticized him in distinctly personal terms for his opposition to busing, saying that as a little girl in California she was part of only the second class that was integrated via a policy of transporting black students to mostly white schools.
We really need to find these women before they get depressed, Karina Davidson, a task force member and senior vice president for research for Northwell Health, told Pam.
My understanding was he was interested in finding lawyers that could augment the defense team, and failing that, he wanted to identify Washington lawyers who had broad experience, whose perspective might be useful to the president's, Barr said.
The anti-Semitism measure was actually watered down substantially; a previous version condemned both Rep. Rashida Tlaib (R-Mich.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) by name and had no chance of passage. But Democrats can't deny that the Republican votes, even when they fail, are revealing divisions in their conference. The question is whether it matters — and who it helps.
I'll never forget watching the Anita Hill hearing on the television in the London Airport with a lot of people gathered around … and I saw this all-male judiciary committee, and it took all these years but here we are, Feinstein said. It's extraordinarily important that this committee be representative of our society at large, and we are growing that way.

It's easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now. You're angry. You're angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.
In 2014, the federal government spent close to $38 billion on Medicaid expansion, and more than half of that money went to the bottom 40 percent of income earners, according to CBO. Separate tax credits to low-income Americans on Obamacare's individual markets cost the federal government $15 billion, while subsidies to help insurance companies offset the cost of expensive patients cost an additional $3 billion, the report said. A majority of both these funds also went to the poorer half of the country.

That $2.2 trillion relief package will provide a one-time $1,200 payment to adults making as much as $75,000, and $2,400 payments to married couples making less than $150,000 combined. Parents will also receive $500 for each dependent child.
Trump has blasted Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan as unworkable and overly expensive, and his campaign says Biden's less ambitious plan would also raise costs for taxpayers. Trump's allies, meanwhile, have been touting the president's record on health care in recent weeks, citing efforts to increase funding for opioid treatment and actions to increase transparency in medical billing.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.

Hsu and Steve Thompson report: Darwin Micheal Mejia arrived on a flight from Phoenix just after 2 a.m., wearing small brown boots with red shoelaces. … 'Look at his face — he's sad, but we're going to be together, and no one's going to separate us again,' his mother, Beata Mariana de Jesus Mejia-Mejia, told a raft of news crews and cameras waiting to capture the moment. Mejia-Mejia, 38, described her first hug with the boy in a month as 'muy lindo' — very beautiful.
That kind of bipartisan agreement for any actual legislation, let alone something this massive and complicated, is unprecedented in modern Senate history. And it underscores just how fearful lawmakers are of not acting immediately to prop up an economy that has already fallen off a cliff.
I think we do have the same shared goal, which is improving patient affordability on the one hand while still preserving future incentives for innovation, Ubl said.
-- Democrats are planning to fiercely oppose Trump's nominee to lead the CFPB, Kathy Kraninger, a former Senate staffer. Renae Merle reports: Democrats fear [Kraninger] is being brought in to oversee a pull back of the CFPB, continuing a path laid out by [Mick Mulvaney]. … Without a deep understanding in the history and complexity of the topic, Democrats and consumer advocates say, she could become a puppet for influential financial groups. … The nomination has become a pivot point for the fight over the future of the consumer watchdog agency.
— Yesterday, Iowa's predominantly Republican legislature passed a bill to ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy. It's a step toward one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation -- one that could set up a Supreme Court showdown, our colleague Kristine Phillips reports.
Now that we are properly provisioned, let us commence our journey. It begins on the electoral cliffs of 2016, where powerful forces stood in the way of Trump's party of adventurers.
The coronavirus is killing roughly 2,670 people every day in the United States. Not a single person has died of a reaction to the vaccine.
What Alec soon learned was just how much his insulin would end up costing: more than $1,000 a month. The price of insulin — once modest — has skyrocketed in recent years, making the lifesaving medication a significant, even burdensome, expense, especially for the uninsured and underinsured, Tiffany writes. At the time Alec discussed skipping insurance coverage, he told his mother, 'It can't be that bad.' Within a month of going off her policy, he would be dead.
House Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.
Average family premiums for workplace plans increased 22 percent over the past five years and 54 percent of the past decade, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. It's a similar story for annual deductibles, which have increased 36 percent over the past five years and 100 percent in the last 10.
This could bolster Democrats ' case that Trump's role in inspiring the crowd to action began long before the 70-minute speech he gave at a rally that day. He amplified these lies at every turn, seeking to convince supporters that they were victims of a massive electoral conspiracy that threatened the Nation's continued existence, the House impeachment managers wrote. More than two dozen people charged in the insurrection specifically cited Trump and his calls to gather that day in describing on social media or in conversations for why they decided to take action.
-- Trump advisers and supporters are split over whether to wage an effort to bolster Sanders, Politico reports. While proponents think Sanders would be an ideal opponent, others are wary that the liberal firebrand could make for a dynamic challenger — with the ability to make inroads in the Rust Belt states likely to decide the outcome of the election. … Among those pushing for a pro-Sanders offensive is the anti-tax Club for Growth. On Monday, the pro-Trump group launched a TV ad in Iowa that attacks Sanders but does so in ways that could help him with Democrats. The commercial calls Sanders 'too liberal' [and] compares Sanders to Democratic heroes Barack Obama and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and says he would spend trillions to combat climate change. The Trump reelection effort, meanwhile, has spent much of the last several weeks focusing its attacks on Sanders — a gambit that two people close to the campaign described as a deliberate effort to draw attention to the Vermont senator. The campaign has used its Twitter account as an anti-Sanders messaging machine and urged prominent surrogates to train their fire on him. Their working assumption is that the presidential attention will only boost his standing among anti-Trump Democratic voters.
Our Post colleague Taylor Telford wrote this week about how Facebook is looking to tackle the challenge of vaccination misinformation on its platform. The company is considering options to make accurate information about vaccinations more accessible to users, but these efforts are in the early stages, Taylor wrote. In the meantime, Facebook sees factually accurate counter-speech by users as a possible safeguard.
Of course, maintaining civil society also requires work on our part: We need to do more to make our case for the virtues of liberal democratic governance, and the need to respect the rules and norms that enable it to function, than we have. But that's a good challenge to grapple with — perhaps, over the long haul, it will prove reinvigorating.
Never was this side of her more dramatically on display than in July 2017, when the Senate faced a vote that would determine whether the Affordable Care Act would live or die.

The lawsuit says that individual members of the Sackler family engaged in acts of deception and misconduct to make as much money as possible from sales of OxyContin, a powerful prescription painkiller, Katie and Lenny write.
Nearly all the Democratic senators who have declared they are running for president have backed Medicare-for-all legislation. But each Democrat has described the goal differently, our colleagues write. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in his weekend stops across Iowa that he backed a 'Medicare-for-all option,' describing a government program into which people could buy while leaving private insurance in place.
Again, even setting aside the questions of morality and legality (which reportedly is what cause Nielsen to hesitate), there's no proof that the separation policy is the only or best way to curtail families seeking entry into the United States. It appeals to Trump clearly in part because he sees it as demonstrating toughness, as using tear gas on migrants reportedly also did. It also probably appeals to him because he seemed to withdraw from the policy only reluctantly in 2018.
In Tuesday's election, exit polls suggest about 80 percent of white, evangelical voters supported the Republican ticket.

Matt Eyles, president of the health insurers trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, called the administration's position misguided and wrong. This harmful position puts coverage at risk for more than 100 million Americans that rely on it, Eyles said in a statement.
But there has been no similar evolution in the Senate, which did not face voters last year. Senate Republicans saw the carnage in the House, but they either didn't feel it or just don't think the solution is embracing Obamacare. While voters called health care a priority in exit polls and Northam won on a promise to expand, some Senate Republicans say what crushed the House was an anti-Trump wave, not pro-Medicaid fervor.
— And here are a few more good reads:
For Sanders to have a chance of winning, let alone proving to be the most electable as he claims, Americans would suddenly have to become comfortable with socialism. That would be quite a change, since, as of three months ago, socialism was viewed negatively in the United States by a 13-percentage-point margin (55 percent negative, 42 percent positive), according to the Pew Research Center.
1. Keep negotiating and try to bring it up for a vote in the next week or two
But if that were to happen, a lawsuit might be able to get the underlying mechanism declared unconstitutional, blocking it from continuing or expanding. This is also why the extraordinary show of national and global opposition we've seen is so critical. There has been a worldwide outcry. Intense media scrutiny has revealed the utter incompetence and recklessness of the measure's drafting — and the profound folly of the underlying idea itself, which has handed terrorists a shiny new recruiting tool. Republican senators are condemning the measure.
At this point, it's hard to imagine Democrats will give in. Congressional Republicans are beginning to get antsy. Trump could have had $25 billion for his wall. It's doubtful that he'll have even a portion of that. The irony, of course, is that any of the above offers would have gotten him a lot closer to his ultimate goal than he is today when the only option he seems to have left is to just blow it all up by declaring a national emergency.
Their bill, dubbed the Medicare at 50 Act, would allow people to buy Medicare plans instead of purchasing private coverage on the Obamacare marketplaces if they are uninsured or prefer it to coverage offered in their workplace.

Yesterday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced repeated questions from reporters about the White House's response to allegations of abuse against Rob Porter:
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
In his last event of the evening, he will address the chairman's global dinner at 8:00 p.m. tonight which is closed press. And for the remainder of the week, we will hold -- I think just logistically we've talked about this. Tomorrow, Wednesday, we will hold an off camera gaggle at the PTT offices -- transition offices. Confirmations have already gone out to individuals who are able to fit into the space. And that e-mail just for what it's worth is credentials@ptt.gov.
Bernie Sanders is planning a campaign kickoff rally in Chicago:
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the Federalist Society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. ACS was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the Federalist Society has done, Fredrickson says. We, too, have chapters across the country. … We also organize events. We have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the Constitution and our laws to the broader public. But the ACS still lacks the reach of the Federalist Society, as measured in chapters and budgets. Fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. Also: They do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. They want to get rid of regulations.
I'm not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process. We do need to do with this issue.

A discussion draft circulating Wednesday afternoon among aides and lobbyists would roll back the Affordable Care Act's taxes, phase down its Medicaid expansion, rejigger its subsidies, give states wider latitude in opting out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
In her view, the county Democratic committee has been lax in upholding core principles. I think people see it as a social club. They say, 'I get invited to candidates' parties. I have a line to public officials.' 
-- Giuliani told CBS News that he'd love to testify during the trial if he can get clearance from the White House. Don't hold your breath. The president's personal lawyer also said Bolton never told him he had a problem with the way he was doing business with Ukraine. He's a personal friend, I thought, Giuliani said. This is the only conclusion I can come to and it's a harsh one and I feel very bad about it: He's a backstabber.
You know, they have a debate going on, they had the first debate last night, Trump told the chancellor, who remained stone-faced. I don't know if you saw it, it wasn't very exciting, I can tell you that. They have another one today. They definitely have plenty of candidates, that's about it. So I look forward to spending time with you rather than watching.
But the Senate, which did not face voters last year, remained firmly opposed during the session. Republican foes there said the House's work requirement amounts to a meaningless work suggestion since it would operate on the honor system.
A common refrain among Warren supporters was that, in picking her, they're following their hearts. Right now, we're in the primaries so you go with who you like the most, said Aaron Jule, 45 of Rye, who is in retail sales. After Tuesday, I might have to deal with something that I have to live with.
TRUMP: And -- and -- and -- I'm a leader. I'm a leader. I've always been a leader. I've never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they're going to do it. That's what leadership is all about.
In that role, Readler wrote the brief supporting a lawsuit brought by 20 Republican state leaders against the ACA. As our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz writes, Democrats were using Readler as a cudgel to make the case that Republicans don't care about protecting sick Americans' health care. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was the only Republican to join Democrats in opposing Readler's nomination.

And it will be something the American people support. We'll see what they are willing to support. It's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats.
Under the 2010 health-care law, most states expanded Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to at least 138 percent of the federal poverty level (and in some places, the threshold is even higher). In these states, new moms are likely to still qualify on the basis of income even after they not longer qualify on the basis of pregnancy.
The tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.
Harvey Weinstein was found guilty on two charges of sexual assault.
AHH: All the drama around repealing and replacing the ACA has definitely stressed us out at times -- but at the most it means we eat a little more ice cream. Apparently not so for Rep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.), who blamed stress around high-pressure health-care votes last year for his alleged sexual harassment of a younger aide. Following a weekend report that Meehan used thousands of taxpayer dollars to quietly settlement the harassment claims, the Pennsylvania Republican told the Philadelphia Inquirer he had deep affection for the aide but never pursued a relationship with her.

Oscar has stuck with Obamacare even after years of financial losses, as well as political uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's push to repeal the law, Zachary reports. After pulling back from several states for 2017, the company expanded into four markets for 2018 — Cleveland, New Jersey, Austin and Nashville — and enrolled about 240,000 members at the end of the first quarter, up from about 90,000 last year. The company didn't say what new markets it plans to expand into in 2019.
Powell has repeatedly urged lawmakers to keep relief flowing, especially for the 10 million Americans whose jobs have not returned since the pandemic began.
More often, though, accidental votes are laughed off and quickly changed when they wouldn't alter the outcome, as in 2010 when Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) repeatedly cast the wrong voice vote against key pieces of the Obamacare legislation he had spent months fighting to pass.

Bloomberg said the State Department's job is building relationships and having backdoor conversations so that we don't make a mistake and misjudge what the other side is doing. He likened the benefits from open channels of diplomacy to the plusses of open-office floor plans, which he said foster more collaboration and cut down on leaking when he was mayor. I'm a big believer in things like seating plans and open plans and how you treat people, he said. That has enormous impact on how they behave.
Even a modest increase in transmissibility could result in many more cases when many hospitals around the country are already stretched to their breaking point. It could also prolong the time that it takes to reach herd immunity, the point where enough people have had the vaccine or been vaccinated that any outbreak dies quickly.
Medical advances have made this conflict more acute, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports. When the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973, it emphasized the concept of fetal viability -- the point at which a fetus might be able to survive outside the womb -- and that a woman's right to an abortion was not absolute. It gave states the right to restrict abortion after that time as long as there are exceptions for the endangerment of a woman's life or health.
WARREN: And we're all on the floor that night for the vote, including the vice president, who's wandering around and trying to make sure that all the folks are staying in line on the Republican side.

On her program, Pirro said that Ryan should resign as speaker, adding that despite his swagger and experience, he presided over a failed effort that allowed our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that.
While it would be harder than ever for Republicans to pass a health-care bill — now that Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, a Democrat, has diminished their Senate majority to just one seat — Cruz said he has had long conversations with the GOP senators who blocked legislation last time around. Cruz added there has been discussion about asking the Congressional Budget Office to rescore repeal legislation now that the individual mandate is gone since that change is expected to result in a more favorable insurance coverage estimate.
 'This is their baby,'  Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is friendly with Trump, said in an interview, describing Trump's outlook on health care. If we can't get it done, I fully expect him to step into the fray.
Change visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying. Trump, in a 2019 presidential memo, declared visa overstay rates unacceptably high and called them a widespread problem. On the basis of a Department of Homeland Security report, he instructed federal agencies to consider action against countries that have business and tourism travelers — using the popular B1 and B2 visas — who overstay in the United States at a rate higher than 10 percent. (Twenty countries have overstay rates higher than 10 percent, according to the DHS report. Except for Syria and Nigeria, these countries accounted for fewer than 1,000 overstayers each.)
With the benefit of hindsight, I wish we had moved faster and asked a different set of questions, Barrett said. I am deeply sorry we did not. Today, I am confident we would reach different conclusions about those two pharmacies. And Joseph Mastandrea, chairman of Miami-Luken's board, said that he believes his company contributed to the opioid crisis.
Guns in hands of a collector who has had them for decades — that is very different from guns that could and do turn over very quickly, Warren said. She made a plea for more federal funding to study what proposals could work, something that the NRA has opposed, and said gun violence should be treated like a national health emergency.
We have much more active moderation now of our volunteer groups, Yang said. Before, it was like, why should we be policing this stuff? I've never physically looked at 4Chan. I think somebody from our team is monitoring it. If there was some active step I could take, I would take it, but the racism is gross and I want no part of it.
Meanwhile, the reserve fund for Social Security is expected to run out by 2035, after which payments will shrink for recipients. The program is set to exceed its total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982, the New York Times's Alan Rappeport reports.
SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said the scorecard is a powerful tool to educate voters and empower them to hold abortion extremists accountable at the ballot box. Last week, the group announced a $52 million election spend for the 2020 election cycle.

GOP lawmakers say the aim is to get Democrats to disclose where they stand on the issue, Politico's Melanie Zanona reports. They can't hide from anyone. They have to take a position, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said.
Seth Meyers thinks Trump is lying when he claims that he hasn't touched his face in weeks:
Our colleague Carolyn notes Amazon has been more upfront about this particular initiative unlike its plans to shake up the prescription-drug industry and develop ways to cut health costs for employees.

(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
In Boone County, the suburban area outside Cincinnati where Sparks lives, Bevin's margin was cut by 20 percentage points compared with his first run. In the adjacent counties of Kenton and Campbell — places Bevin had won handily in 2015 and Trump had carried by 25 points a year later — the Democrat, Andy Beshear, flipped them en route to a 5,000-vote squeaker of a statewide victory.

You might have expected the coronavirus to reduce the Republican Party's enthusiasm for taking away health insurance from some 20 million people, removing protections for preexisting conditions from many tens of millions more, and sending the entire health-care system into upheaval. But you'd be wrong.
OOF: Purdue Pharma -- the pharmaceutical company that made billions off sales of the potent opioid OxyContin -- also considered expanding into the business of opioid addiction treatment, according to once secret sections of a court document filed in a Massachusetts lawsuit against the company.

AHH: Many CDC employees are overjoyed their acting director is back in charge, after the resignation Wednesday of Brenda Fitzgerald stemming from conflicts over her financial interests (including revelations that Fitzgerald bought shares in a tobacco company after she took the helm), The Post's Lena H. Sun reports. When they got the notice the principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, who has nearly three decades of CDC experience, would be taking over (again) as acting director, employees were happy to hear the news.
The dozens of bills passed in Energy and Commerce's health subcommittee in April make small — but significant — changes to the ways federal agencies regulate, oversee and enforce rules on opioid painkillers; how states and localities try to mitigate abuse; and how Medicaid handles patients struggling with addiction.
My Republican friends, do you want to vote for a judge who says protecting preexisting conditions, which affect 100 million Americans, are unconstitutional?, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor. Well, that's what you're going to do if you vote for Readler.

I don't think anyone should ever doubt the president's sincerity when talking about fixing the immigration system, Murtaugh said.
When it comes to health care, readers should be wary about claims that important changes in health-care coverage are without consequences and that people are protected – or that the changes will result in massive dislocation and turmoil. There are always winners and losers in a bill of this size. In this case, if the bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states – and then how those decisions are implemented.

In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Janet Woodcock said the officials are making important strides at understanding how these impurities occurred, mitigating the risk to patients and learning what steps need to be taken to prevent this from occurring again in the future … While the total exposure to these impurities for most patients was small, we are deeply concerned that patients were exposed to this impurity in the first place and that the presence of nitrosamines went undetected for a period of time.
Nor do union executives relish a world in which the rank and file would no longer need them to bargain for health care. This is especially relevant in right-to-work Nevada, where union dues are truly voluntary and might be harder to collect if union services no longer included health-care bargaining.
At least 1.5 million Americans quit their job last year rather than risk getting covid-19. They are now hoping Biden will help them collect unemployment, . So far, about 80 percent of those who quit their jobs and applied for unemployment insurance have had their climes denied, statistics that speak speak to an unfortunate legacy of the crisis: workers have been forced to choose between their paycheck and their or their family's health.

The urban-rural divide that Klein correctly notes as central to the red-blue division encompasses a host of cultural values beyond race, related to religion, patriotism, respect for traditional sources of authority and other lifestyle issues. Working-class whites in rural areas have undergone a social decline epitomized by the opioid crisis, which has led to a drop in male life expectancy in the United States. As Angus Deaton and Anne Case have argued, this is a result of despair engendered by job loss and social isolation.
Yet Trump has proved that when he does weigh in, he risks upsetting the Republican leadership's carefully balanced apple cart — at times contradicting his own aides and the strategy his administration agreed upon with House and Senate leadership earlier in the year, which was to begin with health care and use that as a starting point for broader legislation on tax policy. In one example last month, Trump angered many lawmakers by saying in a private meeting that the House legislation was too mean — just weeks after celebrating the legislation's passage at the White House.
-- Donald Trump Jr., tasked with running his family's business alongside brother Eric Trump, claimed this weekend that he barely has any contact with his father.

Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and a former senior health adviser for the Department of Health and Human Services under the Obama administration, faced back-to-back hearings with the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday. If confirmed, she would have significant influence over federal policymaking on health care at the helm of the OMB, a powerful agency that plays a central role in regulatory review and annual budget development.

2) Keep pressuring Republicans to exercise real oversight on Trump. The fact that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) agreed to rebuke Kellyanne Conway for her on-air commercial for Ivanka's clothing line is an indication that congressional Republicans cannot ignore any and all of the Trump White House's ethical transgressions forever.
O'Rourke was apparently speaking to a teacher when he made this aside. His spokesman says that O'Rourke was referring to a study released by the Texas State Teachers Association (TSTA).

Perhaps more significantly, Gallup found a record-low number of Americans — only 29 percent — think immigration into the U.S. should be decreased, which has been one of Trump's core demands to congressional negotiators. A 39 percent plurality think immigration should be kept at its present level, while 28 percent say it should be increased.
I'm in favor of providing incentives rather than punishment or penalties, he said. If the legislature has some good ideas about what the state can do to make up for problems where Washington has failed or made mistakes that are going to hurt people in Maryland, we're all ears.
At this point, relatively few Senate races look competitive next year, but several governor's seats could be in play. Normally, governor's races are more insulated from issues playing out in national politics, but that might not be as much the case now, said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at Cook Political Report.
I think there's a lot of energy for getting on with both repeal and replacement, he said. The question is, what are the formalities for that? We want to have a due process here, we want to have a transparent process. We want to have a full legislative process.
There's also no talk of getting a score from the Congressional Budget Office on how the changes would affect the cost of the bill or how many Americans it would cover, even though Republicans came under heavy fire in March for advancing their original measure without an estimate from Congress's official scorekeeper.

Julie Mix McPeak, the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which is at risk of having no insurers in 16 counties next year, said that it could be devastating if the cost-sharing payments were to stop.
It's the 18th year in a row that nurses have come out on top of Gallup's annual survey. Among a list of nearly two dozen professions, five medical professions rank among the top 10. The survey found 65 percent of Americans say medical doctors have high or very high levels of honesty and ethics, while 64 percent of Americans say the same about pharmacists and 61 percent about dentists. The survey also found 43 percent and 41 percent of Americans rate the level of honesty and ethical standards as high and very high for psychiatrists and chiropractors, respectively.
We see our institutional decline in the persistence of a health-care system that continues to cost twice as much as in other countries while delivering some of the worst health outcomes in the industrialized world. The reasons are not seriously in dispute: (1) too much care that is unnecessary and too little of the kind that keeps people healthy, and (2) corporate profits and medical salaries that are higher than necessary to attract talent and incentivize investment and innovation. For decades, opposition from special-interest groups prevented anything from being done. When it finally was — Obamacare — most of those same interests used everything within their power to make sure even this modest reform would not succeed.
Trump made a variation of this claim on March 10.
Not all leaders in the fight against AIDS welcomed the initiative. President Trump once again presented a broad strokes narrative that people with HIV and AIDS, including LGBTQ Americans, simply can't trust, Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the advocacy organization GLAAD, said in a tweet.

Yet former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) remain in the race and might very well prevent Biden's push to make this a two-man race.

-- If Trump follows through on his most extreme tariff threats, the thriving economy will sputter. David J. Lynch reports: [If Trump] puts tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports, as he has threatened, the economy would slow sharply. Growth would dip to an annual rate of 1.7 percent, little more than half of the president's goal, and 1.5 million to 2 million Americans would be thrown out of work, according to Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's. The average U.S. household gained an estimated $900 annually from last year's Republican-authored tax legislation. Widespread tariffs, which make imported goods more expensive, would consume $720 of that amount, he said.
Asked about recent reports that Mike Flynn, his former national security adviser who resigned Monday evening, had improperly discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump was sworn in, the president defended Flynn as a fine person, saying he had done nothing wrong in engaging the Russian envoy.
The Trump factor already is being tested in several special congressional elections this year to replace members plucked from the House to join Trump's Cabinet. All have shaped up to be closer than expected, and Trump's troubles are a particular factor in Georgia's 6th Congressional District — an affluent, ­Republican-leaning jurisdiction in suburban Atlanta.
More will soon be known about Trump's physical health, although exactly how much more isn't clear. The exam will take place today at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center under the supervision of Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson, who has been the lead White House doctor since 2013 and oversaw two of former president Barack Obama's exams, The Post's Jenna Johnson and Lenny Bernstein report.
Postcard-sized tax returns. The plan pledges to allow most individuals to file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard, an idea that became popular during the GOP primary debates earlier this year.
For Walsh, it was a daily process of managing an impossible task: almost as soon as she received direction from one of the three men, she was would be countermanded by one or another of them, Wolff writes.
The 2026 date is unmoved from last year, when the trustees predicted the same deadline for the hospital insurance fund. The projections indicate that Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation, the report said. Lawmakers should address these financial challenges as soon as possible.
KELLY: Next, on whether we should accept...
And two weeks ago, a federal judge halted an Agriculture Department rule change that could have deprived 700,000 people of food stamps just as we're heading into a catastrophic recession. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling, then suggested it might wait a while. It might not be a good look right now.
I will continue to be part of that great fight for freedom for years to come, DeMint added.
Pelosi has repeatedly indicated her wish is to improve Obamacare over trying to pass a sweeping Medicare-for-all-type bill, which more liberal members of her caucus have been pushing for. Protect Our Care, a leading ACA-advocacy group run by top Democratic operatives, gave an early nod to the legislation, saying in a statement to Health 202 that it strongly supports efforts by House Democrats to protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower costs, improve care, and push back on the Trump Administration's reckless acts of sabotage.
She was alone, she was little, my mom was out a lot, absent a lot, depressed a lot, Laura says. When my mom went back to school, Sarah would come home from school and she would hide under a blanket until someone came home.

Health 202: Where do you stand on allowing the government to negotiate lower Part D prices directly with drugmakers?
Eric Holder. The former attorney general told reporters in Des Moines that he will decide in March whether he's running for president.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, Trump said, adding: It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
Richman, whose daughter Avielle Richman was killed in the 2012 massacre, was a neuroscientist who founded the Avielle Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to prevent gun violence.
Vindman's lawyer, former ambassador David Pressman, accused Blackburn of defaming his client. That a member of the Senate — at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility — would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice, Pressman emailed. While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.
In early 2016, Republicans passed a test run of a bill via reconciliation that got all the way to Obama's desk. (He vetoed it, duh.)
I will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.
— CFPB reviews payday lending rule. WSJ's Yuka Hayashi: The Trump administration's acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plans to reconsider federal restrictions on high-interest payday loans, a step that could lead to the easing of a rule opposed by the industry and some Republicans. The rule, completed last year when the bureau was still under Obama-era leadership, clamped down on small, short-term consumer loans that can have interest rates as high as 400%. Among other things, it would require lenders to limit loan rollovers and assess whether borrowers can repay the short-term loans.
Northam, 57, is a pediatric neurologist from the Eastern Shore town of Onancock. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and, as an Army major, treated wounded soldiers during Operation Desert Storm.
Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.
I told my members, in order to have a meaningful impact . . . you better speak up now, Dent said.
In the brief, AHIP called a December decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor striking the whole law indefensible. That decision not only contravenes Congress's clear intent, but does so with cavalier indifference to the impacts it would unleash on the health care system—including for all of the 295 million Americans with health coverage today, the brief says.
The report, published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Abnormal Psychology, analyzed a broad group of young Americans and found some of the highest increases were among women and higher-income groups, our Post colleague Tara Bahrampour reports.
OUCH: There's some good news and bad news in the preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this season's flu vaccines. The vaccine reduced the need to go to the doctor by nearly half, and this year's vaccine works better overall and is more effective in children. But as many as 15,900 people may have died this season of the flu, despite a relatively mild season, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.
Seeing the other party as evil increased the likelihood of wishing to see opposing partisans injured by 14 percentage points. This group was also 11 points more likely to wish for general harm against both opponent types equally.
Here's an idea: Ignore Sanders. There are no more debates scheduled. When the primaries come along, Biden will rack up more delegates. Sanders can stay or go, but Biden should be treated as the presumptive nominee, which is effectively what he is. As I have suggested, he can give presidential-type speeches, tap someone to coordinate the convention (and plan a virtual gathering if need be), begin to vet vice-presidential candidates and start consultations with Democratic leadership on the Hill.
It's feasible that states such as Arizona or Nebraska that have struggled to find enough marketplace insurers could benefit from a compact allowing their residents to buy plans sold in another state. But the administration has already sought to fix that problem by expanding the availability of leaner association and short-term plans, so prodding states to form a compact may not move the needle much on consumer choice, Antos said.
Conservatives inside the administration want to forge ahead with aggressive repeal-and-replace, but others are wary of the political dangers of doing so, particularly when it comes to Medicaid:
Under current rules, Medicaid is required to cover all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But with a block grant, states could duck those rules for every condition except medications that treat HIV, opioid use and mental illness. They could decide to cover just one drug for each clinical category.
(Max Bearak) A Danish lawmaker and her baby were ordered out of the parliamentary chamber by the house speaker. Member of Parliament Mette Abildgaard was told by Pia Kjaersgaard, the former leader of a far-right Danish party, that she and her 5-month-old baby were not welcome in the parliamentary chamber. Abildgaard was forced to pass her baby to an assistant while she returned to the chamber to vote. (DW.com) Early estimates indicate that damage to Nebraska farms from recent flooding could near $1 billion. The figure includes the loss of livestock and crops as well as cleanup costs, which could prove substantial. (Laura Reiley) Texas officials aren't sure when a two-day-old fire at a petrochemical storage facility in Houston will end. Air quality, authorities said, is safe despite huge plumes of gray smoke.

An organization dedicated to eliminating wasteful spending in research said the government is feeding cat and dog organs to other cats to study the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. (Eli Rosenberg) A Mississippi police officer who left her daughter in a hot patrol car as she went to have sex in her supervisor's home pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Officer Cassie Barker left her 3-year-old daughter in the car for four hours and found her unresponsive. Authorities said the girl's body temperature reached 107 degrees before she died. (Alex Horton) The Los Angeles Angels are finalizing a record-breaking 12-year extension contract worth roughly $430 million with center fielder Mike Trout.
For a second consecutive weekend, President Trump remained in Washington — tweeting in the morning, holding meetings at the White House and heading to his Virginia golf club on Sunday — all the time surrounded by aides and patrons yet, increasingly, politically marooned.
Buttigieg staffers insist they were focused solely on policy while writing the proposal — regardless of any positive side effects of saving Buttigieg from the political potholes into which Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have stumbled on the issue.
While there were no objections to Lucas's pool reports on Pence, some journalists suggested the presence of the Signal as a member of the pool crossed a symbolic line, into greater legitimacy for the partisan press.
— Barra to Trump: Don't blow up NAFTA. NYT's Neal E. Boudette: General Motors' chief executive urged the Trump administration on Tuesday not to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, and said any changes in the pact should account for the effect on American automakers and workers. 'There could be unintended consequences, changes made, that would directly impact jobs in the United States,' the G.M. chief, Mary T. Barra, said at an investor conference on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. 'Nafta needs to be modified,' she added, but she rejected the idea that 'we need to walk away from it.'
The reality: Lawmakers who dealt with Trump on taxes and especially health care privately told reporters they were shocked how little he knew about these issues.
-- Russian police arrested opposition leader Alexei Navalny and hundreds of protesters across the country on Sunday, as thousands gathered to protest corruption in Putin's government and to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. It was the largest national show of defiance in years. David Filipov reports: Too angry to be cowed, [demonstrators] poured into the street, fed up with their country's wide-reaching corruption and a government unwilling, or unable, to stop it. Police responded with barricades, tear gas and mass arrests in cities across Russia. One of the first detained in Moscow was [Navalny] …who called on people to protest in the wake of his allegations that Medvedev has amassed vineyards, luxury yachts and lavish mansions worth more than $1 billion.
Here are some of the notable findings:
* TRUMP LAWYERS UP: The Post reports that Trump has hired attorney Marc Kasowitz, who has known him for decades and represented him numerous other times, to help him navigate the various Russia probes:
Now there's a consequence, said Hallam, one of the committee's younger, more liberal activists. Someone had gotten the endorsement. The only appropriate response, she felt, was to cull Trump support from the ranks.
-- Former top supporters of Cory Booker accused Pete Buttigieg's campaign of chasing ambulances. From BuzzFeed News: The phone calls to Amy Nielsen came around two hours apart. It was last Monday around 12 p.m., not long after the news broke, when her phone lit up with his name. By then, Nielsen considered Cory Booker 'part of [her] family.' … So the end of his campaign felt … like 'a death.' … The next call came around 2:30 p.m., this time from an unknown number. It was Pete Buttigieg, calling to seek Nielsen's support now that her candidate had made the decision to 'step aside.' … 'It was a gut punch — like, really? He did not 'step aside' for you,' she said. 'Like, wow, that's some nerve right there.' Later that night, she said, Nielsen heard from one of Booker's field organizers who said she had already been contacted by the Buttigieg campaign to go door-knock.
No, these are not world-beating numbers. But they do suggest the prospect of losing the Affordable Care Act has caused some middle-of-the-road Americans to do some soul-searching.
-- A local group known as the D.C. Local Ambassadors has formed to help progressive activists stage protests in the Trump era. Perry Stein reports: The group, comprised of mostly women, all volunteers who live in the Washington region, handled nearly all of the logistics for the March for Truth, training and providing volunteers to ensure everything went smoothly on June 3 … [Laura Sanders, one of the founding members of the group] said she and three other founders first worked together while volunteering for the Women's March on Washington in January … After the historic march, Sanders and the group wanted to remain involved in the city's robust activism scene and quickly discovered a void: There were no comprehensive resources for people to figure out how to plan a protest that projects the intended message while also adhering to federal and city guidelines.
Lee, who is editor of the book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told Annie she was surprised by the interest in her findings during her two days in Washington. One senator said that it was the meeting he most looked forward to in 11 years, Lee told Annie. Their level of concern about the president's dangerousness was surprisingly high.
Instead, the corporate executives pointed fingers at one another as they testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.
In other words, it is far more important to understand what candidates' values are, what their thought processes are, how adept they are at compromising, how well they understand the topic and whether they have enough self-awareness to understand that what they draw up in a policy paper has to work in the real world.
But single-payer looks much less daunting if providers nationally face an 11 percent rather than a 40 percent cut, Sanders's supporters say.
TRUMP: They devalue their currencies. I will do that. And by the way, I have been doing it more and more. But they devalue their currencies, in particular China. Mexico is doing a big number now, also. Japan is unbelievable what they're doing.
Phyllis Murray, 69, emerged from the subway station at 103rd and Broadway where I asked her for her thoughts on the political moment.
McConnell's can't-attack-what-you-can't-see approach of not holding committee hearings is deeply irking a growing chorus of members as even some Republicans join Democrats in criticizing the majority leader's methods. The secretive effort has alarmed Senate Democrats and even some Republicans, Sean, Kelsey and Juliet write. Some Republicans said they were confused about the bill taking shape, voicing frustration about the lack of transparency or warning against rushing.
Most Virginia Republicans staunchly opposed expansion for the past four years, concerned that the federal government would not keep its promise to pick up most of the $2 billion-a-year tab. But opposition in the House softened after Democrats nearly took control of the chamber in November in an anti-Trump wave. The 19 Republicans who flipped seemed to have concluded that they have more to fear from energized Democrats and independents than from potential primary challengers on the right.
Those realities will sorely hamper their promises to further expand health coverage and make it more affordable — even as roughly 30 million Americans remain uninsured and millions more have trouble affording their monthly premiums and annual deductibles.
The study found no link between Medicaid expansion and declines in overdose deaths from prescription narcotics. In an interview, the leaders of the research team — Nicole Kravitz-Wirtz of the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, and Magdalena Cerda of New York University's Grossman School of Medicine — said that Medicaid expansion probably brought many of the poorest Americans into the insurance program. That group was more likely to be using street drugs than prescription narcotics, they said.
Candidates on climate change: There was more unanimity on another dominant issue for Democrats: climate change. Harris said that she supported a Green New Deal, an expansive proposal to transform the country's energy system.
TRUMP: You're going to see, you're going to see.
Members of Congress stood and applauded when Trump highlighted women's electoral gains during his address:
Bryce Case, Grindr's head of security, said sharing information with Apptimize and Localytics is standard industry practice for rolling out and debugging software and was done securely to test and optimize the app's features, such as HIV testing reminders.
But the immediate question, addressed by Mattis's memo and tentatively slated to come before the principals committee of senior national security aides this week, is whether to provide support for a proposed UAE-led operation to push the Houthis from the port of Hodeida, through which humanitarian aid and rebel supplies pass. A similar Emirati proposal … was rejected late last year by the Obama administration, on the grounds that Emirati ships and warplanes, U.S. Special Operations forces and Yemeni government troops were unlikely to succeed in dislodging the entrenched, well-armed rebels and could worsen the humanitarian situation.
Fred Hiatt: And even though you are still able to act as a human, you're also having to say the same thing again and again. I'm sure every question we've asked, you've heard before, and you've explained the Freedom Dividend. And so how do you do that without sounding bored or getting bored with yourself?
The agency has promised to expedite review of applications for any drugs on this list, with an eye toward creating more generic choices for consumers who currently have access to only one branded option.

Herring pushed stories about Planned Parenthood's purported promotion of abortion that he'd seen on CNS News, a conservative site. He passed on to OAN producers a report that Hillary Clinton was ending her campaign because of a brain tumor found during my recent colonoscopy, but Herring warned producers not to run the story until you fact check twice.
OPERATOR: Thank you. We'll go next to Alexis Simendinger from Real Clear Politics.
NAFTA has been a terrible deal, a total disaster for the United States from its inception, costing us as much as $60 billion a year with Mexico alone in trade deficits.
KELLY: Mr. Trump, we will let respond, but will you release the tapes? Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?
I'm proposing alternatives, he said. What's important to realize is this other assortment of tools in the toolbox can achieve the same carbon reduction as a carbon charge. There's a lot of routes to this destination.
SPICER: Thanks, Matt (sic). I appreciate it.
He doesn't look healthy, said Daryl Isaacs, a New York internist who monitored the impact of Morgan Spurlock's month-long McDonald's-only diet for the 2004 documentary Super Size Me and one of the few medical experts willing to venture an opinion about the president. His complexion doesn't look healthy.
CUOMO: What about in Afghanistan? Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize the situation?
And at a rally in Nevada on Saturday: Nobody talked to him. Nobody needed to, and then he walked in: Thumbs down.

Senate leaders on Wednesday were putting the final touches on legislation that would reshape a big piece of the U.S. health-care system by dramatically rolling back Medicaid while easing the impact on Americans who stand to lose coverage under a new bill.
The White House, where aides have suggested a Wednesday vote is possible, continued to lobby members Monday even though no vote had been scheduled. Vice President Pence hunkered in his office on the House side of the Capitol, with undecided and yes-voting members stopping by to talk.
— The Department of Defense announced Thursday it will provide 11 military installations to house 20 quarantined travelers each near airports if the additional capacity is needed, our colleague Marisa Iati reports.
In 2013, the family created its second channel, One America News. Robert Herring's idea was to provide something that had gone missing from the cable news landscape — a basic headline service covering national and international news. Herring, long an active donor to political campaigns, had no journalism experience.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) also went after Sinema, saying, No one should ever be this happy to vote against uplifting people out of poverty.
Geraldo Rivera said he was going to speak out against Iran escalation on Sean Hannity's show, but then he got bumped:
Inslee pointed to a poll conducted this month by the Center for American Progress, a progressive advocacy group, that found addressing the climate crisis is tied with universal health-care coverage as the top priority among Democratic voters in the five early states.
There's, I think, an overabundance of caution up front to make sure that markets get stabilized and coverage gets maintained to the extent possible, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, another former CBO director. They made sure there's enough money in there up front to, sort of, assuage those concerns.
-- Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called for an investigation into allegations of abuse at one of the state's holding centers for young immigrant detainees. Gregory S. Schneider reports: The Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center holds about 30 Latino youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who have been detained by federal agencies over the past several years for being undocumented. A federal lawsuit filed on behalf of the youths claims that they have faced 'violence by staff, abusive and excessive use of seclusion and restraints, and the denial of necessary mental health care.' … 'If Virginia public safety officials find evidence of abuse or mistreatment at this facility, my administration will do everything we can to ensure the safety of these children,' Northam said Thursday in a tweet.
At a moment this fall when his relationship with Trump was at its lowest, McConnell got Trump in front of the cameras to brag about Republicans' rapid pace of judicial nominations.
And today, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) are reintroducing their State Public Option Act, which allows people to buy a Medicaid plan regardless of their income. That measure has broad backing from not just lawmakers (20 senators co-sponsored it last year) but also well-known health policy wonks including former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt.
Normally when a crisis occurs — whether it's a military attack or something else on this scale — it absorbs all the energy and demands that all energy available be directed to the solution of that particular problem, he said. It's very rare for president to use that in such a way to pursue other items on the agenda.
In the 2018 election, which Trump sought to make a referendum on immigration, only a quarter of voters identified it as their most urgent issue in casting a ballot.
Eichenwald, 56, emailed Shapiro in an effort to determine if the 'Daily Wire' founder was using Parkland survivor Kyle Kashuv, who has established himself as a vocal opponent of gun control after the shooting, to 'advance an agenda' regarding Fox News host Laura Ingraham.
OOF: A new report from the Veterans Affairs inspector general found former secretary David Shulkin violated ethics rules and that the agency's security detail compromised safety procedures.
The House passed two measures back in January allowing its legal counsel to weigh in on the lawsuit and condemning the Justice Department's position that the ACA's protections for people with preexisting conditions should be struck down. Three Republicans, including Reed, John Katko of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted with Democrats at the time.
Budget talks collapsed in March over a standoff about Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor. The House wanted to let an additional 400,000 low-income Virginians enroll; the Senate was opposed. The GOP controls both chambers by slim margins.
By expanding [the child tax credit] and making it more accessible, the program will help close the deep racial economic gaps in our country, Neal said in a statement. There are inherent disparities in the tax code that we must work to overcome, but in the short-term, it is the federal government's strongest vehicle for implementing changes like these.
But he also stands by his critiques: I expressed honestly what my belief was with regards to temperament and character.
The vast majority of people voiced anxiety, apprehension, even fear. Several doctors weighed in, warning that the country's most vulnerable citizens would be put at risk by the House GOP's legislation.
But yesterday, political messaging was clearly Democrats' top priority. House Democrats could have advanced a bill yesterday to end a hot-button lawsuit attacking the ACA. Instead, they went with a political-messaging effort intended to make GOP lawmakers squirm.
I was on 'Morning Joe' earlier, explained Coons, the senator from Delaware, as he rushed out of one session and onto an elevator. And then 9 a.m. was Tillerson. And then I had to run to Sessions to introduce my old friend William Cornell Brooks, president of the NAACP.

Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to the federal government's vaccine effort, will work as a consultant for four to six weeks after Biden takes office, before departing. He had previously said he planned to step down early this year but decided to extend his time to smooth the transition process, Politico's Rachel Roubein reports. A transition official told Politico that Gen. Gustave Perna, Operation Warp Speed's chief operating officer, will continue to control the logistics of vaccine distribution under the Biden administration.
The greenlight means retroactive funding for the program that was originally set to take effect last July. The Wednesday move means that the federal government will pay roughly 90 percent of expansion costs for the low-income adults already in the program and those joining in the future. The Democratic governor began expanding the program in January using surplus Medicaid funds, the Bangor Daily News's Michael Shepherd reports. That step was taken in anticipation of the federal approval of an application submitted under a 2018 court order by former Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican who opposed the expansion approved by voters in 2017 and urged the federal government to reject the application.
Two methods substantially boost fit and protection, according to a CDC report and updated guidance on its website. One is wearing a cloth mask over a disposable surgical mask. The second is improving the fit of a single surgical mask by knotting the ear loops and tucking in the sides close to the face to prevent air from leaking out around the edges and to form a closer fit, Lena H. Sun and Fenit Nirappil report.
Now, the way this would work out for 98 percent of Americans is they would still just click that box, go use the app, they would never look at the audit trail, but they would feel some degree of comfort that it exists, and they would get money. So that would be a dramatic improvement. And from the government's point of view, it would be a dramatic improvement to have the audit trail, because then you can look at it and say, okay, I now know what these companies are doing with our our data, which right now we don't. Right now we just hope for the best. I go to Americans around the country and I say, Hey, how many of you actually change your password after you get notified that your company has been hacked, and only half of people do. You know, it's like they're too busy to worry about the fact that Yahoo! got hacked and their password might have been compromised. So right now, the inequities are ridiculously one-sided. I would put the power back into American's hands, but I think most Americans are creatures of convenience. We just want to know that our information is not being abused and exploited.
That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.
We're going to have a full, exhausting conversation at our retreat to go through all of these things, Ryan said Thursday. What I think people are beginning to appreciate is, we have lots of tools in front of us. It's not just a one-and-done-bill kind of a thing. And so that's what we've been walking our members through, are all the options available to us to get this done.
Two Republican state attorneys general — Dave Yost in Ohio and Tim Fox in Montana — recently filed a legal brief outlining the consequences for their states should the courts strike down the ACA.
• Make the U.S. electricity system carbon-free by 2035, meaning if there are any emissions, they will be captured. That will require much more solar and wind power and a revamp of the electrical grid. Coal and natural gas still produce more than 60% of U.S. electricity.
But there are some key differences here. Starr delivered his full, unredacted report to Congress in 1998, complete with grand jury testimony. Congress debated how much of the report to release to the public.
But Monday is where I'd see that the focus should be in terms of some of the bigger issues, but over the weekend he's got -- he definitely has some stuff that he's going to be rolling out. It's just a question of, from a sequencing standpoint, how much he wants to get done on Friday and Saturday. He's got the prayer breakfast, as you know, on Saturday morning and then we'll go from there.
The Signal's editor, Rob Bluey, vigorously defended his organization's presence in the pool, saying there's a hard firewall between Heritage's policy and lobbying operations and the Daily Signal's newsroom.
Bevin was infamous for his insults and bullying — especially of opponents, but even of Republican allies. That caught up to him as the governor sought a second term. Bevin won the primary, but in the general election, matched against a relatively moderate Democrat with a deep pedigree in Kentucky politics, many steadfast Republicans sat the contest out.
Here are three takeaways from the book Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff about President Trump:
Trump engaged warmly with his predecessor. Before the inauguration ceremony, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed the Trumps for tea at the South Portico of the White House. Melania Trump presented Michelle Obama a gift — a box wrapped in the distinctive light blue of high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. She seemed briefly perplexed about what to do with it, with the outgoing president looking in vain for someone to hold the box while the two couples posed for photographs.

Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) won reelection in a contest against an immigration hard-liner by focusing on finding bipartisan solutions to immigration that included more border security. In one of her first ads, Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), who won a Trump-leaning district along the border, showed herself walking along a border fence. We need to enforce our borders and enforce our laws against violent traffickers and criminals, she said in the spot.
At a campaign rally Monday night in El Paso, Trump mocked the Green New Deal as a high school term paper that got a low mark and argued to his crowd of supporters that it would shut down American energy and would shut down a little thing called air travel.
And while there is a fix on the way, some Americans like Shawn McCreary of Doylestown, Pa., have already paid their taxes — and the health insurance credit penalty.
Warren took a walk around a snowy New Hampshire town:
-- Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and a senior adviser on his reelection campaign, claimed on Fox News last night that Democrats are trying to get rid of the electoral college because they've concluded that it will be almost impossible to win in 2020 otherwise. They want to find any way they can to beat Donald Trump because I think they know it's going to be incredibly hard, almost impossible, to beat this president in the 2020 election, Lara Trump said. I think you're seeing … panic mode now on the Democratic side.
In return, the leader has delivered victories for his team to run on. Notably, he served up a platter of GOP tax cuts in 2018 and marched a phalanx of conservatives onto the federal bench in a three-year push that will affect American life for a generation.
Last is -- I'll -- I'll take a look into whether or not some of these events can be pooled. But I would refer you to the presidential inaugural committee on that.
The president's institutional vandalism is partially explained, although not excused, by the breadth and depth of his ignorance concerning the manners and mores of a republic. The Senate's self-degradation is even more depressing.
Maybe I'm a risk-tolerant person, said Smith, a personal-injury attorney who decided to pay the ACA penalty for being ­uninsured.
The worst job losses so far have come in blue-collar and service sectors, including food service, transportation, retail work and manufacturing. But white-collar layoffs and furloughs are becoming more rapid by the day. Job cuts are ticking up for workers in education, entertainment, management and even health services, according to the Labor Department.
But more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the Federalists have achieved. This position might be summed up as: If you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents. Advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the Federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.
By contrast, the U.S. Education Department conducts a nationally representative sample survey of public K — 12 schools, principals and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The most recent survey shows that 17 percent of teachers in the South — and 18 percent across the country — supplemented their income with a job outside the school system.
-- Trump, who held a campaign rally in Manchester last night, has inserted himself into the Democrats' nominating contest with a fervor that exceeds his predecessors — many of whom were reluctant to directly involve themselves in another party's political selection process. Robert Costa, Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey report: The Trump campaign's effort to counter the Democratic race extended to a 'Cops for Trump' gathering on Monday afternoon in Portsmouth … Pence and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump both spoke at the event, which was attended by about 200 police officers … The Trump campaign has been active in New Hampshire for weeks, sending legions of surrogates to the state and booking them on state-based talk radio programs and at local Republican events. For Trump and his loyalists, New Hampshire holds a particularly special place in their collective political memory: It was his first primary victory and a significant boost that pushed him toward the 2016 Republican nomination.
He meant that former Florida governor Jeb Bush supported Ryan's vision. So did Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal.
Perhaps even more notably — and related to the point above — it sounds as though Trump and his team aren't really going to use the power of the presidency to get skeptical Republicans on board.
Now Azar is trying to expand those efforts, calling the new payment experiments a pivotal hockey stick moment.
The Trump administration has thus far sent letters requesting the right to survey nearly 600 private propertise set to fall in the fence's path -- step one in the eminent domain process that allows the govenrment to seize private land, according to the Texas Tribune.
No, replied Leonard Schleifer, chief executive of Regeneron, which develops and makes vaccines. The executives meeting with Trump explained that the coronavirus was new and therefore could not be protected against by vaccines developed to immunize people against other viruses. The drug company executives repeatedly explained to Trump that it would take more than a year to develop, test and bring to market a coronavirus vaccine. But moments later, the president told reporters that the scientists' timetable could be much shorter: I don't think they know what the time will be. I've heard very quick numbers, matter of months.
You can try before you buy, so to speak, as a country, Buttigieg said.
Remember this because it's very important, and I'm speaking now for the Republican Party: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always.
When Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) told a crowd of supporters last month that Democrats would impeach the motherf-----, referring to Trump, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), a close ally of Tlaib's and Pelosi's, pulled Tlaib aside and counseled her to be careful. When officials at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other Jewish leaders angrily called leadership offices about remarks made by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that were seen as insulting to Jews and Israel, Pelosi crafted a rare public rebuke of the freshman, calling on her to apologize for her anti-Semitic tropes.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) delivered a speech on Jan. 17, comparing President Trump to Joseph Stalin and criticizing his attacks on the media. (U.S. Senate)
The Trump administration rules, which were finalized in November, allow objections to the birth-control mandate on both moral and religious grounds. They broaden the range of employers able to claim such objections to include essentially all non-governmental workplaces, Amy adds. And they give the employer the choice of whether to permit a workaround accommodation.
Tenney referenced the gross national product (GNP). This is similar to the gross domestic product (GDP) but factors in only goods and services produced by U.S. residents. The GDP is broader and accounts for all goods and services produced within the country.
Join us at noon today for conversations with Vivek Murthy and Sen. Bill Cassidy.
-- Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, whose committee was responsible for half of the now-defunct health care legislation, announced Friday that the panel would mark up a resolution of inquiry into Trump's tax returns and other specified information. But the request is not by choice – Roll Call reports that the vote is being forced by Democrats under a procedural tool that requires either the resolution be marked up by the committee, or the minority can bring it up on the floor.
I wore it to show my disgust with the Democratic Party, said Nick Viglione, a councilman in the small borough of Mount Oliver. He voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but plans to cast a ballot for Trump in 2020. So this Kass didn't like Obamacare? So didn't a lot of people.
That story line was building long before Trump embraced it. Its origins were relatively banal. One week after the 2016 election, Obama told members of his campaign group, Organizing for America, that the Trump years would be boom times for activism.
There's really only one way to do this: bringing all parts of America forward to greater prosperity, rather than allowing the current geographic split in economic trajectory to continue. This could entail any number of steps — from universalizing broadband access in rural areas, to investing in rural colleges and infrastructure, to direct employment subsidies in distressed areas — but the important thing is to try. Contrary to the Zen precept, you can't hit the target unless you're aiming at it. Ruy Teixeira is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority and America's Forgotten Majority: Why the White Working Class Still Matters.
And I was always against going into Iraq. In fact, I -- believe me, I was always against it. There was some cases where I sort of -- in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern -- said that -- said that...
The president has since discarded that idea, to the disappointment of Democrats. But Azar and Co. appear eager to take a different hard line against the industry by shifting more drug coverage under the Part D umbrella, a program that has more discounts and negotiating tools at its disposal.
(You can apply for SNAP through your home state. Here's more information from the Agriculture Department.)
The report is based on a review of redacted portions of Massachusetts's 274-page civil complaint, David reports, noting these passages remain blacked out at the company's request after the rest of the complaint was made public on Jan. 15. A Massachusetts judge ruled this week the entire complaint should be released, but Purdue Pharma has until Friday to seek a further stay.
Warnock's attempts to claim the moral high ground haven't sat well with everyone in the Black church. In December, more than two dozen church leaders politely asked him to reconsider his pro-choice views, saying his rationalizations reflected grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility.(At the same time, those leaders praised his efforts to share Christ while pursuing political solutions to our most pressing problems today.)
Even Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general who is leading the defense, said he doubts the agency would change its position. The Trump administration from the President on down has taken every step possible to sabotage the ACA and refused to stand up for affordable healthcare for millions of Americans, so it's hard to imagine that DOJ would change its tune, Becerra said in a statement provided to Health 202.
Jimmy Kimmel explained private arbitration to his viewers:
Now the administration's shaky handling of the coronavirus outbreak is further alarming some Republicans, given that pollsters regularly find health care at the top of voters's concerns.
Barr said Friedman asked him a number of questions, including what he had said about Trump publicly, and whether he might have any conflicts.
Here's what Ryan recently said about it:
The Kaiser Family Foundation polled this very approach back in March, and found only 19 percent of Americans favored repealing Obamacare first and then working to replace it. That's at least higher than the 12-17 percent of Americans who like the Senate health-care bill. But another 75 percent either didn't want it repealed (51 percent) or preferred to hold off on repealing until a replacement is crafted (24 percent).
Restricting drugs Medicaid covers by setting up a list of covered medications.
I'm not going to get in the position of every time somebody has a really good idea or a big idea that I have to talk in great detail about my position on it, Brown said at a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. I know that the easy thing to do is say, 'Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.' 
Late last week, Northam said he would resort to hardball if need be: If the legislature sends him a budget without expansion, he will add it as amendment — a procedure that gives him a stronger hand in the Senate.
OOF: A trio of female scientists teamed up to understand why there's a dearth of women leading the biotech industry and to push for change. They found, based on data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that fewer than 10 percent of the 250 start-ups by MIT faculty were founded by women, even though women made up 22 percent of the faculty.
— U-Haul announced it will stop hiring smokers or nicotine users in 21 states at the beginning of next month. The policy, which is part of an effort to develop a culture of wellness, will take effect in states that don't already have protections for smokers' rights, our Post colleague Lateshia Beachum writes.
The new regulations allow small businesses, associations and self-employed individuals — including those operating in different industries – to band together to buy health coverage by pooling all of their employees together. The health consulting firm Avalere has estimated 3.2 million people could eventually be covered by such plans, which have to comply with the same rules governing large employer plans.
Without giving specifics, Obama suggested that money for expanding subsidies could be found because congressional budget analyses have shown that the law is costing the country less than was predicted when it was enacted in 2010.
In fact, Biden came to his Charleston rally from a fundraiser in Mount Pleasant at the home of a prominent local lawyer on the banks of Hobcaw Creek. State Sen. Marlon Kimpson (D), who is black, led the donors in a reprise of the Fired up, ready to go chant that was common during Obama rallies. On the most fundamental decision that President Barack Obama had to make, and that is choosing a vice president, he chose Joe Biden and he has said, the president has said, that's the best damn decision he has ever made, Kimpson said at the fundraiser. Don't be confused by the fantasyland nirvana proposals. It ain't going nowhere. Senator Sanders has spent more than 30 years up on Capitol Hill talking about the same thing, and nothing has passed. Let's not get it confused.
Booker, also asked about immigration, seemed to surprise some in the audience when he started his response in Spanish.
Insurers and other health-care industry stakeholders sent letters to Trump and lawmakers Wednesday, insisting that they needed certainty about the federal funds, called cost-sharing reductions, that allow the majority of people in the marketplaces to benefit from cheaper deductibles and co-pays. That afternoon, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump described in detail how he could cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse by withholding those funds.

Jonathan Capehart: You were talking about your Freedom Dividend, and I was struck by a phrase that you used, which was, you know, getting the Freedom Dividend as a right of citizenship. And it made me think, maybe I have this at the top of my head because I interviewed him yesterday, but Jonathan Metzl of Vanderbilt University has written the book Dying of Whiteness. And his whole argument is people are willing to die rather than be connected to or finance policies that they believe are giving resources to people they view as undeserving. So what I would love for you to do is to please talk about how you'd address the clear societal hurdles to achieving the goals that you set out.
Rubio and Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) plan to reintroduce their alternative family leave proposal within the next month, a measure that draws from existing Social Security benefits and is significantly less generous than what Democrats are proposing. It offers six weeks of paid leave that would be extended only to new parents.
We should ALWAYS take the trump speeches live in their entirety, executive producer Lindsay Oakley wrote to her staff early in the campaign. I don't want producers' personal feelings getting in the way of the news content we provide. Trump is being treated unfairly by the mainstream media and we need to provide the other side. . . . Not to mention we have loyal viewers that tune in specifically to see the Trump speeches live because no one else carries them. We also see some of our highest ratings during the Trump speeches.
The annual March for Life brings many thousands of people to the Mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. It marks Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy.
Stop spending money on space exploration until the United States can fix its potholes. Encourage private space-exploration companies to expand. (Trump proposed increased spending for NASA and launched Space Force.)
Fix the background check system used when purchasing guns to ensure states are properly uploading criminal and health records. (There have been no significant fixes to the background check system, even as Trump flirted with such ideas after mass shootings.)
There are a number of ways the Biden administration can try to walk back this effort.
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds a hearing on addressing campus sexual assault on Tuesday.
— Abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America criticized Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) for her remarks supporting Trump's nominee to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sinema praised Michael Liburdi's qualifications.
10:15 a.m.: Barr says he will look into FBI's opening counterintelligence investigation into Trump
KASICH: All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them. Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son, who took his own life.
Gingrich is right. McConnell is the equal of Lyndon B. Johnson, the former president who was known as the master of the Senate for the power he wielded as majority leader. The complexity of our time, the depth of partisan rancor and the intensity of media glare may lead McConnell to be judged a more talented legislator than any other senator. Fresh off the 96-to-0 vote to pass the $2.2 trillion emergency coronavirus relief legislation, the largest rescue package in U.S. history, McConnell must prepare to guide his caucus through the legislative equivalent of Scylla and Charybdis: the dangers of doing too much or too little while still guarding core American commitments to free speech, free markets and the rule of law.
But Trump's mockery of McCain rings hollow in other ways. McCain has been home in Arizona all year to treat his cancer, and it's not clear when he will return to Washington. The form of brain cancer he is battling is a particularly aggressive one.
This is the sort of stuff that has been kicking around the conservative message-board crowd for decades. Trump, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, is elevating it to the national conversation. Daily.
When Trump plays offense, he's the center of attention (his favorite place), and he forces people to react to him. Even if he doesn't get what he wants, he's put his opponents on the defensive. Forcing them to play defense means that they have less time and less energy to play offense against him.

SPEAKER: My name is Dee Angle (ph). My cousin Rebecca Ann Johnston (ph), known as Becky, was murdered on January the 1st, 1989 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you. And if you don't vote Trump, we won't have a country. Trump all the way.
Pressured again by his far-right flank, he said, no.
That means highly anticipated treatments from Janssen, Sanofi and Novartis for depression, diabetes and multiple sclerosis among many other potential new therapies are at risk. There are ten pharmaceutical companies set to have the FDA make a decision about their drug in March, which would be after the agency's funds run out if the shutdown continues.
The company said it would offer a so-called authorized generic of the product, Humalog 100, for $137.35 per vial, which is half the current list price, the New York Times's Katie Thomas reports. This new product will be called Insulin Lispro. Such an authorized generic means that, besides the label, it is identical to the brand-name drug and manufactured in the same facilities, Katie writes.
-- Trump's national public health emergency declaration on the opioid crisis expired because his people at the Department of Health and Human Services forgot to renew it. An HHS spokesperson said the nine-day lapse had been corrected and blamed a clerical error. The emergency status, first announced in 2017 as a measure deemed necessary to direct more resources toward the drug overdose crisis, needs to be renewed every 90 days. (Politico)

Perinatal depression can increase a woman's risk of suicidal symptoms and can also increase the chances of a baby being born prematurely or with a low birth weight, Pam reports.
Tanden, who served as a key architect of the ACA, told lawmakers that she would help Biden lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60, advance paid family and medical leave, and lower drug prices.
These I see as lasting victories that will make this country more prosperous and more secure for decades to come, Ryan said.
Another supporter asks about his wife, who is addicted to painkillers and lives in a federally sponsored rehabilitation program an hour away. Don't worry because we're going to get rid of it, Baldwin-as-Trump says. We're junking it, junked. Now she's going to live wherever she wants to. Did I make you feel better now?
-- Buzzfeed, Donald Trump And America's National Nervous Breakdown, by Katherine Miller: Trump's presidency currently poses a fundamental question for each person: Is this overall moment weird but ephemeral, maybe not so bad — or is it an emergency? Given the current level of uncertainty (does Trump really mean X?) and the sheer volume of incoming information (what will Trump do tomorrow?), each day demands your judgment. Is this normal? Is this normal? Is this normal? And why are we living this emotionally fraught, all-consuming, fluid yet didactic, meta argument over how to act or think about each day?
You'll forgive me for quoting that at length. It's just so funny to me, someone for whom the Web has been a central part of much of my life. It's just this necessarily cumbersome language that now sounds like a robot trying to write a poem.
In 2020, the National Diaper Bank Network distributed more than 100 million diapers to 220 diaper banks across the country, a 67 percent spike year-over-year, The Post's Hannah Denham reports.
While this would lower premiums for some Americans, health experts say it would also siphon off younger, healthier consumers and could destabilize the market for more generous plans.

Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.
Complaining of people in the bowels of bureaucracy saying if you're not a chairman, you ain't going to get an answer to anything, an agitated Grassley made several complaints, specific and generally, about how little the Trump administration had responded to requests for information from members of Congress — who, he stressed, were constitutionally obligated to conduct oversight.
An Atlantic editor argued that Trump's strategy is at odds with America's demographic future:
I know that she's polling in third, fourth or fifth in New Hampshire. I certainly hope she sticks with it, said Warren supporter Kelly Scanlon, 44 of Dover, who works for a nonprofit organization that assists the developmentally disabled. The rhetoric revolving around picking a candidate who can beat Trump feels like coded language to me that means it needs to be a white male. Because they don't want Hillary 2.0. That rhetoric has hurt [Warren] a little bit. At one point in time, she was considered the front-runner. That's when the talking heads started discussing 'concerns' about her 'electability.' That's a word that comes up, obviously, a lot.
Subsidies are available to Americans earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Starting in 2020, under the Senate bill, this assistance would be capped for those earning up to 350 percent — but anyone below that line could get the subsidies if they're not eligible for Medicaid.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, like Raimondo a moderate Democrat, said transportation programs have often been first to be cut in her state in budget crises, which is counterproductive to growth. Governments, Kelly said in an interview, should make sure that we're a job creator, not a job killer. New Deal-style jobs programs, she added, may suddenly be appropriate again.
It gave us momentum, McGrath said in an interview. Matt Bevin was incredibly unpopular, and Kentuckians got rid of him. Mitch McConnell is also very unpopular.
In the 116th Congress, now in its second year, there have been, Toomey notes, votes on just 20 amendments — one was a sense of the Senate legal nullity, four were noncontroversial or largely devoid of substance, six were killed using a procedural maneuver, and none of the other nine came close to passage. The Finance Committee has held one substantive markup in 13 months.
An editorial in today's Wall Street Journal decries Democrats for trying to put the electoral college on the chopping block, calling it more evidence of the party's disdain for constitutional norms.
Roughly 20 million Americans have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure became law in 2010 without the support of any Republicans in Congress. The Trump administration eliminated a financial penalty for noncompliance and cut funding for programs that help sign people up. Biden says he would protect what remains of the law, and expand it.
• Enact a payroll tax of 12.4% on income earned above $400,000 to boost the solvency of the Social Security system and expand benefits. Currently, only wages up to $137,700 are taxed to fund the Social Security program.
Since then, OAN has become a reliably sympathetic voice of the administration's goals and actions. Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has a deal to appear regularly on the channel. The network's White House reporter, Trey Yingst, has become an administration favorite who was called on at the daily news briefings 27 times in Trump's first 100 days in office. On Friday, OAN won a seat in the White House briefing room, albeit in the back row and shared with the BBC.
If the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton is any guide, Trump's could stretch not only past the Iowa caucuses but make it impossible for senator-candidates to campaign in the run-up to the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary. They will be sending out surrogates to speak on their behalf, conducting early-morning interviews by satellite and teleconferencing into evening town halls.
In an example from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a married mother in Texas loses Medicaid coverage two months after giving birth if she and her spouse have an annual income above $3,692. Maternal health advocates have been pushing for a longer guarantee of coverage, perhaps closer to a year.
Yarmuth is planning to examine a large-scale Medicare-for-all bill from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), one that is similar to the sweeping measure long touted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on The Need to Pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
Trump's focus on the issue has motivated Democrats to care more about immigration than they did in the past and to hold more progressive views. In 2010, only 28 percent of Democrats said they wanted to hear candidates talking about immigration. Now 48 percent do. Eight years ago, 35 percent of Republicans wanted to hear candidates talk about the issue. That number is essentially unchanged now, at 34 percent.
Key excerpt: A few hours after the O'Reilly [firing] announcement, Ailes, from his new oceanfront home in Palm Beach — precluded by his separation agreement with Fox from any efforts to compete with it for 18 months — sent an emissary into the West Wing with a question for Stephen K. Bannon: O'Reilly and Hannity are in, what about you? Ailes, in secret, had been plotting his comeback with a new conservative network. . . . In reply, Bannon let Ailes know that for now, he was trying to hold on to his position in the White House. But yes, the opportunity was obvious.

THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
But even if McConnell got struck by lightning or something and suddenly became convinced that changing this historic Senate rule was a great idea, he probably wouldn't be able to. He would need to put it to a vote, and Senate Republicans simply don't have the votes to end the filibuster. A year ago, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) sent a bipartisan letter to McConnell with a total of 61 senators urging him to preserve the filibuster.
Presidential candidates are rebranding Rep. Jim Clyburn's anti-poverty program as reparations.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested the United States should consider escalating its opposition to the Maduro regime in Venezuela:
His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary, read the letter the Trump campaign released in December 2015, right before the GOP primaries started. If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) said it was disgraceful that the Trump Administration has been hiding such outrageous actions from the American people. Who would believe that in the 21st century our government would separate thousands of children from their parents, and without any public awareness?
As it announced its much-anticipated vaping policy Thursday, the administration ordered companies to stop manufacturing, distributing and selling most cartridge-based e-cigarette flavors — including mint and fruity flavors — after 30 days, as our colleague Laurie McGinley wrote.
I've gotten more death threats around here than I can remember, Dingell once told the AP. It used to bother my wife, but oversight was something we did uniquely well.
— The House is pushing forward with its opioids' effort, scheduling 39 bills for votes this week and dozens more for consideration next week. Most of the measures are modest and bipartisan, like one allowing the government to repay up to $250,000 in student loans for some drug-treatment workers who agree to serve in places especially hard-hit by the opioid epidemic or another directing providers to more prominently display substance-abuse problems in patient records.
The other two bills being considered by the subcommittee would supply new funding for navigators — a not-so-subtle dig at the Trump administration for mostly canceling grants for groups that enroll people in marketplace plans. It would also restore now-expired funds for states to run their own marketplaces instead of relying on Healthcare.gov.
You know I don't agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is they don't all agree with everything I believe in, he says. But I need to get 50.1 percent or more, and I'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people.
Administration officials seemed aware of how their announcement might be received. They notably avoided using the polarizing term block grants. Azar stressed the approach isn't mandatory or top-down reform, noting that states could take or leave it.
The path forward is still hopeful. Vaccines are already protecting many of the most vulnerable, which could soon have an impact on hospitalization rates and deaths. And as more of the population is vaccinated, experts expect the crisis phase of the pandemic will end. As immunity builds up, the coronavirus may end up as a mild endemic disease, more comparable to the common cold or the flu.
As Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) put it in a blistering speech Tuesday: We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.
It's just different shades of gray, said political analyst Geoffrey Skelley of the Universtity of Virginia Center for Politics, who then corrected himself: Or different shades of blue, there you go.
On Saturday, the two candidates vying for the Democratic nomination meet in their first debate ahead of the June 13 primary. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, who spent years laying the groundwork for this run, will square off in Fairfax against challenger Tom Perriello, who has taken the mantle of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others looking to reinvent the Democratic brand.
With that, I'll open it up to a few questions.
Like you, I am also a military sexual assault survivor, McSally said. But unlike so many brave survivors, I didn't report being sexually assaulted. Like so many women and men, I didn't trust the system at the time.
Republicans believe a conviction would embolden Trump and enrage his base in a way that could hurt them all in 2022 and 2024, Politico reports . He does a pretty good job of being a victim, said a GOP senator. If he were to be convicted, there would be an uproar among his supporters. And it would probably energize them.
It's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.
-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) released their Green New Deal, which is already stoking Democratic divisions. From Dino Grandoni: Fault lines within the Democratic caucus were already visible before the end of the day, with some members urging caution about setting vague and, at times, impossible-to-achieve goals to only fall short ... And perhaps most importantly, the plan has yet to get the formal backing of one crucial Democrat: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
-- A Hawaii judge has narrowed the injunction he placed three months ago on the administration's revised travel ban. Politico's Josh Gerstein reports: U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson scaled back the injunction Monday, nullifying its impact on studies and policy reviews ordered under the directive Trump issued in March and billed as an anti-terrorism initiative. In a ruling last week, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the bulk of Watson's injunction, but said portions of it that blocked the Trump administration from studying vetting procedures were too broad and should be lifted.
Eventually she lost the weight. But by then cost loomed as a barrier because, burned out on the tech field, she had retreated to a friend's home in the St. Louis area to write computer books. Last year, Powers said, she made $4,000 for that work; the year before, she earned $22,000.
Finally, even those who have, or get, private insurance still face financial risks that could bankrupt them during this pandemic. Congress's earlier covid-19 legislation waives cost-sharing only for testing, but many people are being evaluated without a test, and the cost-sharing for treatment can be incredibly expensive, even in the thousands of dollars. Patients in seriously affected cities also may be sent — without being consulted — to non-network specialists or hospitals or have to pay ambulance fees, which can result in daunting surprise bills for the balance above the insurance payment.
As politicians and political scientists both know, the political sustainability of reforms can never be taken for granted. Even so, the duration and intensity of conservative resistance to the ACA is historically unusual. The ACA is a moderate law, modeled on ideas that Republicans once supported, such as insurance purchasing pools. What's more, many red states refuse to accept the ACA's funding to expand Medicaid to more of their citizens — such as Texas, which has a large number of uninsured residents — even though you would think they would want those federal benefits.
Before Azar's speech, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, the agency will release a 55-page 2018 Annual Report, shared first with The Health 202. The report lists dozens of steps taken by HHS and its sub-agencies in the past year — from the widely praised to the more controversial — which Azar says are furthering his top goals of reducing drug prices, making insurance more affordable, changing how care is paid for and halting the opioid abuse epidemic.
Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, premium tax credits help make health insurance more affordable. In general, this premium is not available for people who otherwise are eligible to enroll in other minimum essential coverage, like government-sponsored health care. (For veterans, that would include VA health care.)
I don't know that we would have any insurers participating in the exchange market, and I don't think Tennessee would be alone in that, Mix McPeak said.
Subsidize premiums for COBRA coverage at 85 percent.
Finally, start dusting off your resume. It's never too early to start looking for your next job, said David M. Smith, professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School in Malibu, Calif. Even though businesses in your field may not be hiring during the coronavirus crisis, you'll be better off when jobs do start appearing for having prepared for those openings.
If the funds are not adequate for enrollment, the state would place the money in an escrow account to help the resident obtain coverage during the next available enrollment period.
Ailes had a suggestion: Speaker Boehner.
At least one other candidate also spoke of a personal experience with health care — Bennet, who recovered from prostate cancer earlier this year.
At the time, party leaders feared they were losing their say in determining their party's nominee. This feeling only worsened during the 1980 convention, when governors and members of Congress had to ask for guest passes to gain access to the convention floor since none of them were delegates, This feeling only worsened during the 1980 convention, when governors and members of Congress had to ask for guest passes to gain access to the convention floor since none of them were delegates, according to Kamarck.
In recent weeks, the battleground for the Senate seat was concentrated in Prince George's and Baltimore, home to large communities of African American voters, an important segment of the Democratic coalition.
The short answer to the question is: I haven't seen it either, Lee says into the camera. Even though I've been a member of this working group assigned to help narrow some of the focus of this, I haven't seen the bill.
• Spend $50 billion in his first year to repair roads, highways and bridges.
In 2010, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) campaigned for a safe Republican seat in Congress by pledging to fight government-run health care. Every two years, he won easy victories while telling voters he was fighting to repeal Obamacare.
In other words, the news that reporters received about the vice president came from a journalist employed by an organization with a vested interest in the direction of White House and federal policy.
KASICH: Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.
Meanwhile, as one libertarian policy analyst recently suggested, Republican voters might be inclined to draw exactly the wrong lesson from an outcome that underscores the GOP's worsening demographic challenges: that the answer is to redouble opposition to immigration, since it is swelling the ranks of Latinos voting Democratic. That, too, would be a delusional conclusion to reach, but it's certainly a real possibility — after all, polls showed that lots of Republican voters supported Trump's various prescriptions and pronouncements on immigration.
In an interview that aired on Feb. 7, President Biden called the pandemic's effect on schoolchildren and the workforce a national emergency. (CBS News)
The House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee holds a hearing on the GOP-led lawsuit to overturn the ACA and the impact on people with pre-existing conditions.
KELLY: And you're not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors...
Both candidates emphasize the issue. But Perriello is more likely to use the language of working-class angst, while Northam talks of economic opportunity.
There's a real pastoral problem right now that in any given congregation that it's a topic you can't talk about, Mouw said. I don't think it's fear. I think it's genuine pastoral perplexity about how we deal with this.
Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) said Obamacare is no longer affordable and Bill Clinton said Obamacare is crazy.
Trump also used the questions to press his case that the United States would be well-served by a better relationship with Russia and to mock his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for her efforts to reset the relationship between the two countries while she was secretary of state.
Do you support or oppose Trump using emergency powers to build a border wall (Washington Post/ABC News, 788 Adults)
The alternative is to pass some Obamacare changes that affect the nation's budget now using the simple majority vote afforded by reconciliation, and worry about the rest later. That's actually how Democrats passed major parts of the ACA in 2010, and it's how Republicans passed some of the Bush-era tax cuts a decade earlier.
Democrats have often acknowledged that the ACA is not a perfect law and can be improved, particularly by making monthly premiums more affordable. But bipartisanship remains elusive as Trump and many in the GOP demand that the law be scrapped.
NETANYAHU'S COMEBACK: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vaulted ahead of his main challenger in national elections, according to exit polls, with the strong showing by his Likud party bringing him to the brink of a parliamentary majority, our colleague Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report from Jerusalem.

— President Trump is in good health, and has not seen major changes to his health status, his doctor said in a memo released by the White House. Still, Trump gained four pounds over the last year, and the president's new weight puts his body mass index over 30, which means he's officially considered obese, our Post colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Carolyn Y. Johnson report.
Principled conservatives understand this and are working to address climate change. Heather Reams, executive director of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, is one. She says her group's polling shows that millennial GOP voters as well as other key demographics such as suburban women and independents not only believe in climate change, but also that the party needs to do more to address it. Her group supports McCarthy's package of bills because it will not result in dismantling the free market like Green New Deal would.
Call an international conference focused on how to halt the spread of the hateful ideology of Radical Islam.
4. Are there alternatives to ending it?
Which brings us back to the dispute between pharmaceutical companies Braeburn and Indivior.
Harris, obviously, chose the high-end estimate.
Yet Trump still frequently frames McCain as a spoiler to one of the central pieces of the president's agenda.
State and local officials see budgetary mayhem on the horizon, and the federal assistance coming their way in the rescue plan is inadequate. Thus the urgency of a new economic rescue package that includes far more help for lower levels of government. If states do massive layoffs or budget cuts, said Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, you're just going to prolong and deepen the recession.
Despite making promises to help address youth vaping, Sheila writes the FDA is worried the December agreement Altria made to purchase 35 percent of Juul will expand the reach of the very pod-based products it said it would stop selling until the youth vaping problem was addressed.
However, it remains an open question how many of the blue-collar and other nontraditional GOP voters who backed Trump will turn out for other Republicans when he is not on the ballot. At the same time, Democratic voters tend not to turn out as strongly in nonpresidential years.
Democrats warn that a frenzied push to dismantle Obama's legacy could leave Republicans without any hope of getting the bipartisan support necessary to push through other parts of the Trump agenda, including the replacement bill and a pricey infrastructure project.
In a sign of its influence, President Trump recently echoed a key talking point of the group on the need to expand VA's Choice program, which gives veterans access to private doctors. We want them to have choice so that they can run to a private doctor and take care of it, the president said at a rally in Ohio the day after Shulkin's firing. And it's going to get done.
The dissatisfaction with DeMint, fueled by several factors, came to a head this month as his contract came to an end. Among the issues was tension between DeMint and Feulner, his predecessor, who was concerned that the DeMint-era emphasis on political activism overshadowed the institution's role in the intellectual development of the conservative movement, according to people familiar with the situation.
The political dilemma for Republicans is clear: Despite his behavior on and before Jan. 6, which House managers have so far dramatically documented in the trial, Trump continues to garner strong support from Republicans, among whom a clear majority agree with his false claims about what happened in November, oppose his removal from office and believe Republican elected officials should continue to follow his lead in the future, our colleagues Scott Clement, Emily Guskin, and Dan Balz reported the week after Jan. 6.
Among them: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump supporter who defended him during one of the darkest periods of his campaign, when lewd Access Hollywood tapes emerged of Trump discussing grabbing women. Trump courted Meadows in meetings and calls, but White House aides say he feels scorned by Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus members — and keeps a close watch on their television appearances and how they talk about him.
From Susan B. Anthony's Marjorie Dannenfelser:
• Revive the 2015 multinational deal intended to limit Iran's nuclear work in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump scorned it as one-sided. Biden says the U.S. would rejoin if Iran returns to compliance with its terms.
And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.
A January Quinnipiac poll, moreover, found that 5 percent of Democratic voters agreed with the unsupported claim that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than American citizens are. That compared with 24 percent of independent voters and 39 percent of white voters without college degrees.
Meanwhile, Klobuchar, who announced her presidential candidacy this week, distanced herself from the details of the Green New Deal proposal circulated by Ocasio-Cortez's office. She said Tuesday on Fox News that she would vote for the climate change resolution but that the situation would be different once it got down to the nitty-gritty of . . . actual legislation.
And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say...
Cardinal Health was fined $44 million in 2016 to resolve allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of narcotics and paid a $34 million fine in 2008 to settle similar allegations. McKesson agreed to pay $150 million in fines in January to resolve allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of narcotics. In 2008, the company paid a $13 million fine for similar allegations.
These measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
I just don't see privatization as a good thing for veterans, he told PBS's NewsHour the day after his dismissal. I think those that are really sticking to a political ideology are doing this for other reasons, like financial reasons, [and] don't have the interests of veterans at heart.
I don't deny that Biden could build on this emergency measure — with, say, his $2 trillion climate plan, or the creation of a public option for health care — in ways that could be transformational. But what he has done so far does not indicate the triumph of socialism, or even the return of the New Deal. It shows a distinctly American talent for achieving liberal goals by market-oriented methods.
The Supreme Court will considering hearing a case that could settle the face of the Affordable Care Act at its conference on Feb. 21.
The justices, without comment, turned down a motion by the Democratic-led House and Democratic-led states to expedite review of last month's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. That court struck down the ACA's mandate for Americans to buy health insurance but sent back to a lower court the question of whether the rest of the law can stand without it.
McConnell now: Unfortunately, it will have to be a Republicans-only exercise. But we're working hard to get there.
Democrats have cranked their Medicare attack machine to full blast over the latest budget from President Trump, which proposes a 5 percent reduction in spending for the health-care program for the elderly over the next 10 years, along with reductions to Medicaid and medical research funding.
If he won, they'd have to shelter in place for four years, joked one Republican consultant with a raft of high-tech clients.
Yet the plan did not meet the ACA requirements, which include minimum coverage standards intended to ensure a baseline level of quality. So he would have faced paying a tax penalty — perhaps about $2,000, depending on how much he earns this year.
Some 100 nations have expressed support for the proposal, but it faces opposition from wealthy Western countries with large domestic pharmaceutical industries, including the United States. Activist groups who support the measure, including Doctors Without Borders, say that it could allow more countries to produce vaccines and speed up vaccine delivery to poorer countries.
The secret approach by Mr. Trump came as a number of his supporters have expressed resistance to the vaccine, and as other officials have tried setting an example by getting the shot in public, the Times's Maggie Haberman reports. President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence received vaccine shots in front of television cameras.
[Other countries] have policies in place that are more centralized in the pricing of their drugs, said Shawn Bishop, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund. They have policies in place that directly link the price of the drug to the value of the drug — we don't have anything like that.
Purdue denied the allegations, but said it would work to fight the crisis. As a company grounded in science, we must balance patient access to FDA-approved medicines, while working collaboratively to solve this public health challenge, the drug company said in a statement.
On the policy front, particularly on health care, Pelosi is focusing the caucus's attention on improving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which was her chief legislative accomplishment during her first term as speaker.
The city most affected by debates over border security looks nothing like the fortress that border security hawks imagine for the country.
Because when the senator from Texas shut this government down, my state was flooded, he said. It was underwater. People were killed. People's houses were destroyed. Their small businesses were ruined forever. And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down. For politics. That he surfed to a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. (Cruz actually won the Iowa caucuses.)
This claim especially caught our attention. The House GOP added together four elements that amount to $471 billion, or 25 percent of the total: $61 billion for the expansion of Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies; $54 billion for the minimum-wage increase; $110 billion for making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable; and $246 billion for the unemployment insurance expansion.
A spokesman for the former president denied that Obama or a White House official requested surveillance of a U.S. citizen. And FBI Director James B. Comey asked the Justice Department to issue a statement this weekend refuting President Trump's charge (it has not thus far).
Members are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: The Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.
The party of the vice president, who acts as president of the Senate and breaks ties when they occur. That will be the Democratic Party after Biden is inaugurated as president and Kamala Harris becomes vice president. Her tie-breaking vote assures the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, will become majority leader. (The Senate technically has 48 Democrats and two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who reliably vote with them.)
-- The U.S. military is preparing to pull all its forces out of Syria by the end of April. The Wall Street Journal's Dion Nissenbaum and Nancy A. Youssef report: With U.S.-backed fighters poised to seize the final Syrian sanctuaries held by Islamic State in the coming days, the U.S. military is turning its attention toward a withdrawal of forces in the coming weeks, [current and former U.S. officials] said on Thursday. … The Trump administration has been struggling to come up with an agreement to protect Kurdish allies from being attacked by Turkish forces. … [But Washington and Ankara] have made little headway, current and former U.S. officials said, which means the U.S. military withdrawal is proceeding faster than the political track.
Back then, Biden was a senator from Delaware. In 2009, he became vice president and helped President Barack Obama pass the Affordable Care Act. On Oct. 1, 2013, the new health-care system's website went live.
Consider this. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who is preparing to hold hearings on Democratic-led health proposals popularly referred to as Medicare-for-all, asked the Congressional Budget Office this week to examine single-payer systems in which the federal government is the primary payer of health insurance.
As his confirmation hearing drew to a close, Barr continued to explain his comments to the New York Times in 2017. In an email to the news organization, the future nominee said he saw more evidence to investigate a controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia, as well as alleged wrongdoing at the Clinton Foundation, than potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Now, this move probably won't have a ton of practical effects. The IRS announced last year it would pull back on the Obama administration's planned ramp-up of enforcement of the mandate. The agency will continue its practice of basically turning a blind eye when people fail to indicate on their tax returns whether they purchased health coverage for the previous year. IRS agents will still process such returns, essentially giving people an easy out if they were uninsured but want to skip paying the penalty.

Perriello's approach may be what voters want to hear, Holsworth said, but Northam's is more pragmatic. Perriello is not going to beat Northam on the grounds of what he can do with the General Assembly, and one would think . . . some of the populist economic positions he's taken are likely to be more symbolic than real, Holsworth said.
It has the potential to be used in other states, and it's part of abortion opponents being emboldened … and conservatives turning over every rock to see how they can ban abortion, Elizabeth Nash, who studies state legislation at the abortion-rights supporting Guttmacher Institute, told The Post.
The House Ways and Means Committee is doing parallel work on overall ACA replacement. But according to the several people familiar with the House leadership's approach, a central idea under consideration there — new health-care tax credits — hit a snag this week when congressional budget analysts reported privately to the committee that the credits would cost the government a lot of money and would enable relatively few additional Americans to get insurance.
Modernize and renew the nuclear weapons arsenal. (Trump claimed early on that the U.S. arsenal was bigger and more powerful than before, but with little to back that up.)

AHH: Eight Republican lawmakers joined Democrats in condemning the Trump administration's decision to support a federal case seeking to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.
 I think you get at best six Republicans — probably five and maybe six,  Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said.
Bring down drug prices by importing cheaper medications from overseas and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. (By and large, drug prices haven't decreased.)
TRUMP: OK. Wouldn't matter. I never said it.
The president-elect's agenda removes a separate campaign idea that the House speaker and other conservatives favor: changing tax law so that individuals can deduct the cost of health insurance. Critics say such a switch would weaken employer health benefits that have been the mainstay of coverage since the 1940s.
In Washington, where TYT has beefed up its presence since 2016, the network is known for strongly favorable coverage of Sanders. It has been a media partner for the senator from Vermont 's national town hall meetings; in 2016, Uygur repeatedly appeared on the campaign trail at Sanders rallies. But any candidate willing to appear in 2019, he said, would get a fair hearing.
The fundamental problem with American corporate governance is not the makeup of boards but the imperative imposed on them by Wall Street to maximize profits and share price. Reining in the power of investors and giving companies the freedom to come up with their statements of corporate purpose — these would be more effective ways to get American companies to strike a better balance among the interest of all their stakeholders.
The Brookings Institution hosts an event with outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Tuesday.
Gorsuch was born in Colorado and lives outside Boulder with his wife, Louise, and two daughters. He is a fan of outdoor sports — fly-fishing and rowing — and said in the speech at Case Western Reserve that he was skiing last February when he received a phone call with the news of Scalia's death.
White, who is a former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a former U.S. attorney, added it would be difficult to settle the cases because [y]ou have municipalities and counties as well as state AGs involved in these matters… And getting all of those plaintiffs in a global resolution is very difficult.
Erasing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a set of policies long favored by conservatives remain at the core of the agenda. But in his first interview as president-elect, Trump significantly softened his language for the ACA's fate, telling the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Either Obamacare will be amended or repealed and replaced.
-- The New York Times Magazine, Is North Carolina the Future of American Politics? by Jason Zengerle: Welcome to North Carolina circa 2017, where all the passions and pathologies of American politics writ large are played out writ small — and with even more intensity. Ever since 2010, when Republicans seized control of the General Assembly for the first time in a century, and especially since 2012, when they took the governor's mansion, the state's politics have been haywire. 'There's been a bigger and quicker shift to the right here than in any other state in the country,' says Rob Christensen, a longtime political writer for The News and Observer newspaper in Raleigh. In just a few years, North Carolina Republicans have not just run quickly through the conservative policy checklist; they've tried to permanently skew the balance of power in the state in their favor.
Democrats, meanwhile, are deriding those benefits as crumbs, no more than a rolling public relations campaign by corporate giants to thank the GOP for the windfall (a new poll shows it may be working, with support for the tax overhaul nine points, to 46 percent, over just a month ago). Executives and shareholders, Democrats say, will still claim the lion's share.
In a statement after the bill was passed, Labrador said, We have negotiated legislation that keeps our promise to the American people to lower health costs while also protecting those with preexisting conditions. Furthermore, unlike the first version of the AHCA, our bill showed it had enough support to actually pass the House.
Feeling left behind, the socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, quickly weighed in with his plan to restore the inheritance tax to where it was in the 1970s: 45 percent for estates valued at $3.5 million and rising to 77 percent for billionaires.
We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.
The second Obama election, I wrote a very backhanded endorsement of Obama, saying I thought he hadn't done the right thing, hadn't been good at things that I think are important, Bloomberg said, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by CNN.
The efforts were not designed to actually persuade anyone but rather to get under Trump's skin and present Bloomberg as the guy who could beat Trump at his own game. Bloomberg is out of the race but has said he fully intends to use his fortune to help defeat Trump.
This is a flu. This is like a flu.
Did the creature bite or sting?
Trump and Mulvaney went further than just considering a new proposal — they forced the Justice Department to litigate against the entire ACA. That left all Republicans on the defensive on an issue they would rather just avoid.
We couldn't be more proud of what we've done, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday in an interview.
Whether you call it prescience or a good bet, it's true that so far, everything McConnell hoped would happen after Scalia's death did happen. And the success could keep paying off with the upcoming midterms by giving his party something to campaign on.
Trump's sporadic salesmanship on the bills and ambitions lingering on Capitol Hill has become a defining characteristic of the complicated relationship between the president and congressional Republicans. Although Trump routinely proclaims his desire for political victories, he has yet to make a full-throated case to the country about legislation that Congress is pursuing and has spent a modest amount of time attempting to twist arms in the House or Senate.
Biden crashed a reporter's live shot during a town hall in Iowa:
-- But, but, but: Mitch McConnell doesn't care what you think, Ben Terris writes in a new profile of the majority leader. He just wants to win.
All we're asking ... we understand they have the majority and if they can get to 51 they're going to be able to enact what they're going to enact, Schatz said. But they're so afraid of the American people finding out what's in this bill that they're hiding it from everybody, including United States senators, until the very last moment.
Federal regulations issued under the Obama administration direct states seeking permission to experiment with new Medicaid policies to, in most cases, estimate effects on coverage before the initiative starts, and then independently evaluate the impact of the programs after they begin to assure they are achieving their goals, Noam writes. Federal regulations from 2012 state applications to implement Medicaid experiments will not be considered complete unless states make an estimate of the expected increase or decrease in annual enrollment.
You know, as you mentioned, he did speak with Senator Paul last Friday. He mainly talked about their desire to repeal and replace Obamacare and institute healthcare options that are more in keeping with frankly what the -- what the ultimate goal of the ACA was from the get-go, which is to lower costs to the American people and provide additional access to doctors and plans.
The recent internal conflicts surfaced publicly after images of old Facebook posts by committee member Heather Kass appeared in the Pittsburgh Current, an alternative newspaper.
The council has recommended tackling the epidemic by increasing pain management training for opioid prescribers, making the potentially lifesaving drug naloxone more widely available and expanding access to addiction treatment, Ian writes.
But considering Republicans control the Senate and the White House, a key question is whether Democrats will play ball on policies that could get bipartisan support for the purpose of getting something done. Given the public concern about health-care costs, the issue could finally be in a sweet spot where members of both parties find it in their political interests to tackle.
* TRUMP VOWS TO READ POPE'S TRACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: Trump met with Pope Francis this morning, and per Reuters, this happened:
The court has a 6 to 3 conservative majority, but two of those on the right, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, said plainly during oral arguments that they doubted Congress's actions indicated a desire for the entire law to fall.
RUBIO: Here we go. It's personal.
Democratic strategists and officials argued Monday that Trump's budget proposal exposed how little credibility Republicans have in debating health care, and showed signs of confidence that it would sharpen the contrast Democrats are seeking to make in the run-up to the 2020 election.
The No. 2. Senate Republican John Thune (S.D.) said a delay on health care made sense, explaining Trump looked at the possibility that anything could move, I mean the idea that he could get a Democrat House to agree with the Republican Senate on something he wants to try to get enacted. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), however, said Trump's tweets did not take the pressure off the GOP to come up with a plan.
Nothing in the Bolton revelations – even if true – would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense, Dershowitz declared. Even if the president, any president, were to demand a quid pro quo as a condition for sending aid to a foreign country – obviously a highly disputed matter in this case – that would not by itself constitute an abuse of power, he continued. Quid pro quo alone is not a basis for abuse of power. It's part of the way foreign policy has been operated by presidents since the beginning of time.
From the Virginia congressional district once represented by Eric Cantor, here's a fresh illustration of how Trump has completely taken over the GOP:
Bright spot: Because Joe Lieberman is senior counsel at Kasowitz's firm, picking him as director of the FBI (which is probing the Russia affair) could present a conflict, so it might not happen.
But secondly, look, you're in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great. OK? But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like, that's a whole 'nother issue, OK? Another issue.
Turning to me, Conway says: That's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … He's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the District. … The younger people really feel it, and their view is: This will end, the current era. And they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We need Trump now.
Until Donald Trump was elected president 18 months ago, Democrats were quick to defend ACA insurance plans, praising their broad coverage and noting the wide availability of subsidies to lower costs for American seeking access to health coverage. When news of big rate hikes hit over the past few years, Democrats mostly turned a blind eye, wary of criticizing President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative.
With that, Silverman, Emmy-winning standup, TV host and now podcaster, walked into the dispensary and acquired a spliff of Indica for her antagonist. He smiled at the olive branch, but they were already at peace. While she was inside, he had paid her parking meter.
— Jan. 25, interview with ABC News
OAN newscasts often couch the day's events in language that reflects the owner's point of view. One night last month, anchorman Mike Dinow introduced a story about health care like this: In another sure sign Obamacare is on the way out . . . . A few minutes later, Dinow started a story with this line: The president keeps another promise, slashing regulations to a historic low.
— The American Lung Association is calling out the federal government for not doing enough to combat youth vaping.
Some Republicans say the departure of two Democrats conservatives love to hate — Obama and McAuliffe — drained much of the emotion from the debate. The House's messaging also may have helped. House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) billed expansion as conservative Medicaid reform since the House plan would impose work requirements on recipients — something the Trump administration has supported elsewhere.
Any organization receiving Title X funds will be required to establish a bright line of both physical and financial separation between its family planning activities and any program or facility that performs or refers women for abortions. Since 1976, federal law has prohibited use of federal funds for abortion. But today, Planned Parenthood clinics that receive federal family planning funds often essentially refer women for on-site abortions. Under Trump's Protect Life Rule, this will no longer be permitted.
One question will be whether Trumpism continues to stain the GOP after the election in the minds of those voters, and if so, whether that helps Dems ultimately get back the Lower Chamber.
— No Sen. T-Paw. Politico's Kevin Robillard: Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said Tuesday he won't run in a special election for the Senate later this year. Pawlenty, now the CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, a powerful bank lobbying group, ruled out a run during an appearance on Fox Business Network. 'I'm interested in continuing to serve,' Pawlenty said. 'There's a variety of ways to do that, [but] running for U.S. Senate this year won't be one of them.'...
We accept the prices, but the flip side of that is we have an expectation that there will be vigorous competition, Gottlieb said.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.
Centrists who dared to step forward to criticize these proposals were immediately shouted down as morally compromised sellouts — all the more so if they happened to be baby boomer billionaires with presidential ambitions. The campaign to dismiss and disqualify these discordant voices was reminiscent of a similar effort four years ago against anyone who dared to question the wisdom or the inevitability of Hillary Clinton's presidency.
She also mentioned DACA as a policy decision to which she objected, but criticized Trump as well for his divisiveness.
For example, if Republicans want to get rid of the individual mandate (and they do) while keeping the popular requirement that insurers cover preexisting conditions, Claxton said, it would blow up the insurance market because insurers would be required to accept unhealthy people without also mandating healthy people sign up, as Obamacare does.
OUCH: Here's the latest warning coming down from the FDA: Steer clear of so-called young blood.
The potential move shows how Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, are under pressure to respond to mounting litigation accusing the drugmaker of misleading doctors and patients about risks associated with prolonged use of its prescription opioids, they write.

They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches. … We had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches.
The statement came in response to questions from Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), who said he was still confused about Barr's earlier testimony on the fate of the Mueller report. He hypothesized that Mueller had written a report and given it to Barr.
As part of an effort to attract more votes, Republicans have added an amendment, crafted by Rep. Tom McArthur (R-N.J.), that instead allows states to seek individual waivers from the law. One possible waiver would replace the continuous coverage provision so that insurance companies for one year could consider a person's health status when writing policies in the individual market. Another possible waiver would allow the state to replace a federal essential benefits package with a more narrowly tailored package of benefits, again limited to the individual and small-group markets.
With all honesty, what the Biden administration has to balance here is standing up for our values, while at the same time trying to keep a very delicate geopolitical balance [to confront] what is the greatest threat in the region, and that is Iran.
— A new analysis from Kaiser Health News found the pharmaceutical industry gave money to various patient advocacy groups that have expressed opposition to a Trump administration proposal to change what drugs are covered by Medicare Part D's protected classes.
We're really looking at a whole range of options, he said.
There was no legal basis for what was an essential government function then, according to Neil J. Kinkopf, who was with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel at the time.
The activists who helped oust Joe Crowley are increasingly recruiting against the rest of New York's delegation, including at least one seat that could be swung by a Republican in a bad cycle for the party. That's a bit of a clash with the strategy that emerged after November's liberal defeats in swing districts.
-- Trump and congressional Republicans are considering cutting billions from the giant spending they just passed. Politico's John Bresnahan and Burgess Everett report: White House officials are working closely with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on the rescission package, said the sources. It's not clear which programs could be targeted or when the House would vote … Under the 1974 Budget Act, a rescission resolution could pass the Senate on a simple majority vote. … But some Senate Republicans could balk at such cuts after they recently supported the omnibus spending bill.
For too long, pharmaceutical price increases have thrived in the dark. Between drug companies and middlemen, secret negotiations, rebates and discounts and just plain greed, it can be impossible to tell what is behind a medication's price. If elected, I will pass a prescription drug price sunlight law that gives Virginians clear information about the cost of their drugs and the real reason for any price increase. We're going to shine a bright light on these companies' pricing practices. If they aren't preying on Virginians, they should have nothing to hide. Virginia should have the lowest possible drug prices, and we're not going to leave a single dollar on the table. We'll pool our purchasing power at the state level to maximize our negotiating power and look at creating multistate purchasing pools. We'll explore bulk-purchasing options to lower consumer costs, especially for costly drugs and treatments, and institute a pharmacy benefit carve-out model for Virginia's Medicaid program that will save our state tens of millions of dollars. And I will call on the Biden administration to give Virginia approval to import select drugs from Canada, where consumers pay about one-third of the drug costs we do.
Johnson and McConnell have not always enjoyed a warm working relationship, according to several GOP aides familiar with their relationship who were granted anonymity to speak candidly. Johnson was frustrated after McConnell and his allies nearly wrote off his chances of winning reelection in 2016. In the months since, Johnson has agitated for a bigger role in Senate GOP circles, particularly on health care.
The Daily Show compared Fox News to North Korean state television:
Doctors specializing in addiction are often not in the rural areas that were hardest hit during the opioid crisis. NPR writes 40% of counties across the country don't have a single provider who is approved to prescribe buprenorphine.
Donald Trump is the victim. His campaign is the victim, said Levin, as a Fox News alert scrolled over the screen. These are police state tactics. If this had been done to Barack Obama, all hell would break loose. And it should.
Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
Quentin Kidd, a political scientist and pollster at Christopher Newport University, said the public may not be best served by the approach, but it's smart politics.
Blue Cross Blue Shield, which provides health insurance for more than 100 million people, accused those lawmakers of voting to undermine our democracy.

A Pentagon contract linguist was charged with espionage.
SPICER: I think you just stated it yourself. The president-elect during the campaign was very clear that he had the commitment to preserving and protecting both Social Security and Medicare. And as we work through this reform, the repeal and replace option, that's one of the tenets that's guiding -- and principles that's guiding his decision-making as he works with Congress.
There was a time when the GOP majority was big enough to hold firm against such policies. Republicans controlled the House by a 66-to-34 margin before an anti-Trump wave nearly erased it. In the aftermath, Davis said, we negotiate.
The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health holds a hearing on Overcoming Pharmaceutical Barriers on Feb. 5.
But many states neutralized this burden to insurers by allowing them to increase rates for other plans. It gets wonky, but the end result, Ginsburg said, is that ending the cost-sharing subsidies has cost the government money but has not destabilized insurance markets as much as people had feared.
An Iranian official tweeted his nation's flag just after the strikes, mirroring Trump, who tweeted the U.S. flag after Soleimani was killed:
Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R-Rockbridge), who is running for Congress, said the move would put Virginia's fiscal health at risk.
Another supporter complains that his premiums went up under Obamacare and that he has to drive 90 minutes to see his doctor. Trump assures him he's talking with the Freedom Caucus, and we're going to get rid of it.
Both Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden, the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, have been making regular statements on the outbreak, seeking to contrast their approach with Trump's. Sanders in particular says that the pandemic demonstrates the need for Medicare-for-all, his universal coverage plan, under which testing and vaccines would be free.
It's hardly clear that Fink, for all the pull that BlackRock's size would seem to confer, is going to meaningfully reshape conversations in boardrooms on Wall Street and beyond. For one, BlackRock is still working through what to do with its own tax windfall. On its earnings call last week, the firm's chief financial officer projected it will make $1.2 billion in stock buybacks this year, plus more divided payments, in addition to evaluating our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products.
The travel and public relations push will continue over at least the next three weeks, with each day this week having a different theme, ranging from 'Help for Small Business' (Tuesday) and 'Help for Schools' (Wednesday) to 'Help Immediately With Direct Checks' (Friday).
It's really important to get Dr. Price in as secretary, said Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health. That's going to be key to working with us, and we obviously know a lot about what he thinks about.
If you actually showed the people that we know that we're in the midst of a mental health crisis, a wellness recession, a civic engagement depression, that would be alone a massive step forward. And also, if you have these measurements, then many, many organizations would naturally try to remedy them. So nonprofits and local governments would look and say, Wow, it's incredible that our social measurements are declining this precipitously. We need to do something about it.
Buttigieg's initial response to the shooting had disappointed activists and family members of the victim, who criticized the mayor as not showing compassion or offering new information. He canceled campaign events to address it, but the controversy underscored tensions between the young, white mayor and the black community in South Bend, where 40 percent of African Americans live below the poverty line.
I mean, yeah, I came to it because my hands were bound, Silverman says in a recent Zoom interview from her apartment in Los Angeles. I couldn't do standup and I had no place to put stuff. But now I realize this was really what I needed to do. I just can't believe the freedom and the messiness and the looseness. It's maybe something I didn't realize I was missing.
How Russian biotech trampled protocols — and challenged the West — in race for Sputnik V vaccine , by Robyn Dixon: Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine now has a globally recognized seal of approval after British medical journal the Lancet published a peer-reviewed paper last week that put the vaccine in the same league as Western doses — with 91.6 percent efficacy 21 days after the first shot and 91.8 percent for those over 60 years old. For Russia's biotech industry, the results are heady validation after facing Western skepticism, fueled largely by Russia's decision to release the vaccine before medical trials were complete — even using researchers as test subjects.
The Affordable Care Act means that people can't get kicked off their insurance for pre-existing conditions, Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted. With the stroke of a pen, this court filing by the administration would take that away.
Trump mocked Bloomberg for dropping out of the race, and Bloomberg responded with a clip from Star Wars:
The American Rescue Plan reduces economic inequality — but not in such a way that it punishes the wealthy. According to the Tax Policy Center, the legislation will boost after-tax income in the lowest quintile by about 20 percent. Those in the top quintile will see their after-tax income rise by 0.7 percent. This is a pretty anemic socialist revolution.
Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November, Trump tweeted. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!
Knives out for Azar: Officials say Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is being blamed for fail[ing] to coordinate the response, as agency chiefs waited for instructions that came too late and other deputies were largely cut out of the process, Politico's Dan Diamond and Adam Cancryn report.
The key quote : Everybody is seeing the chaos and the destruction that the pandemic has caused, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and one of the bill's lead authors. And it's really making people look and [ask], could we have had something different had we had a Medicare-for-all system in place?
In 2017, Marino withdrew his name from consideration to be the nation's drug czar after a joint Washington Post/60 Minutes investigation detailed how he helped push legislation to weaken the Drug Enforcement Administration's power to go after drug distributors amid a rise in opioid-related deaths.
Biden said that, as vice president, he had worked to get U.S. troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan. That gave Sanders an opening for another attack on the former vice president.
And everyone knows Lab people and beagle people are two totally different kinds of people.
This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job.
As the NBC First Read crew observes, it's clear that Trump's arm-twisting hasn't paid dividends — at least not yet.
A video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes, even as Floyd gasped for breath and eventually stopped responding, incited nationwide protests and demands for policing reforms.
Even still, the president seems unwilling to give up the fight entirely. In a pair of tweets yesterday, he insisted he never wanted a vote on the issue before the election.
Ryan and his leadership team have also reopened negotiations with moderate House Republicans to vote on immigration bills, against their better judgment.
In November, the American people said they want aggressive action, and the legislation Democrats are unveiling on Tuesday is a giant step in that direction, said Protect Our Care Chairman Leslie Dach. It stands in stark contrast to President Trump's ongoing war on America's health care and his budget that cuts Medicaid and Medicare by nearly two trillion dollars and ends protections for people with pre-existing conditions by repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Corcoran said Ohio is studying why children lose Medicaid and CHIP coverage, and trying to improve how county offices enroll and re-enroll families.
Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?
He said, I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a founder and former chairman of the group, said he had no regrets about killing the bill.
By keeping these two taxes in place for anywhere between five and seven years, according to several Republicans, the federal government could steer more money to a stabilization fund to help offset consumers' health-care costs while the new GOP plan goes into effect.
These steps are ways to stabilize the individual and small-group health insurance markets, provide more flexibility to states and issuers and give patients access to more coverage options, Pate wrote.
I talked to a very well-known TV journalist, and I said: 'You know, I think it'd be really great to have a town hall on single payer. You can design it however you want,'  Sanders added. He said, 'Bernie, that's a great idea. We'll run it up the food chain.' I never heard back.

We have a health care crisis in the country on many levels, but Republicans for 10 years … have done everything possible to eradicate the Affordable Care Act, and they've done that without offering any plan. This is the far right, he said. The far left is now suggesting Medicare-for-all. That is a $32 trillion number … Does anyone here really understand that Medicare-for-all means you will lose the choice of your doctor and insurance company?
While Republicans were trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act during President Trump's first year in office, Bloomberg said he favored some of their ideas such as high-risk insurance pools and capping the tax exclusion for businesses that provide coverage for employees. In a 2017 op-ed for the New York Post, he wrote: The Affordable Care Act has provided health care coverage to millions more Americans, but there are still some 30 million with no insurance. Premiums are too high. The individual mandate isn't encouraging enough people to buy into the system. Some of its regulations and taxes make little sense.
In reviewing the past eight years of interactions between the two, we assigned a rough value for how warm or cold relations were between the two (an admittedly subjective analysis). Roughly speaking, the periods in which Romney has spoken most warmly about Trump correlate to moments when Romney was seeking political office to which Trump might contribute. An exception was shortly after Trump took office, when Romney offered his support for Trump's success.
It's going to be fine, Trump told the audience about 25 minutes into his speech. We're going to all get together. We're going to get something done.
-- The court also threw out a case from post-Sept. 11 detainees against officials in the George W. Bush administration. The detainees, many of them Muslim, claimed they were abused while being held by New York City's federal immigration authorities. Bob has more: Six plaintiffs brought a representative suit … They alleged they were held because of their race, religion, ethnicity, and national heritage and immigration status, and were subjected to verbal and physical abuse, daily strip searches and months in solitary confinement. None of those held at the detention center in Brooklyn were found to have any connection to terrorism. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said that the treatment alleged by the men was 'tragic,' but that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York was wrong to let the suit proceed. In general, government officials are shielded from civil lawsuits when they have acted in good faith in carrying out their duties.
On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.
But Sanders's supporters say the figure is misleading, and that doctors and hospitals could absorb cuts to their payments under the plan, which also would extend free government health insurance to every American in the country.
The aim is to help vulnerable seniors overcome three of the most challenging current barriers: questions about the vaccine, scheduling, and transportation, Slavitt told reporters.
So the goal of government should be to improve these measurements at every turn. That's another reason why having them as the core measurements of our economy is so important. Because right now, if you have these surges in deaths of despair, which you do in much of the country, that should be a red flag for us all, particularly for government. What's happening right now is that Americans fear that our government is essentially not accountable to the success or failure of our people. So if you were, let's say, a state government in Ohio and then you saw these epic surges in opiate deaths to the point that your morgues can't actually accommodate the bodies and they're storing them at local funeral homes. The government looks up at this and says, well, this is a major problem, and then it tries to do something about it. But the people don't feel like anything happens to the government, whether the opiate deaths continue or get better.
The clip being circulated of Congressman Wilson's town hall last night shows less than a minute of a positive event that lasted nearly two hours where the congressman engaged with his constituents both in a town hall format and one-on-one after the official program ended, spokeswoman Leacy Burke said in a statement to The Washington Post. The congressman took great questions on a wide range of issues, from national security and North Korea to immigration.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the third case considering the legality of the Affordable Care Act on Nov. 10. (The Washington Post)
Before this week, the Trump and Biden administrations had already bought, or contracted to buy, 1.2 billion doses from six different vaccine manufacturers. They include:
Economists at the Urban Institute, an independent research group, released on Sunday a proposal that would get the nation to near-universal health-care coverage and relieve many of the financial burdens some people face under the current system — and cost the federal treasury far less than more radical plans. It would leave in place Medicare and the employer-based health-care system, whereby most Americans get their insurance. But it would create a new health-care marketplace for most everyone else — those on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which are government initiatives for low- ­income people, and those buying insurance on their own in the individual market.
The longtime AIDS researcher asked HHS Secretary Alex Azar for his $375,000 salary to be cut after a top Democratic senator and others raised questions, Lena writes. His initial pay was almost twice what his predecessor earned and more than other past directors...Brenda Fitzgerald, the former Georgia health commissioner who resigned from the CDC in late January because of financial conflicts of interest, served for half a year at an annual salary of $193,700.
They're politically protected, but not anymore, he said of pharmaceutical companies.
We have examined those changes in depth in a report and exposed the false talking point that rape or sexual assault would be considered a preexisting condition. So how does this figure of 129 million fare?
Saccone, a four-term state legislator with a long military and academic résumé, struggled to unite the Trump or Murphy coalitions. Labor unions, with more than 80,000 members in the district, had sometimes endorsed Murphy. They united quickly against Saccone, a supporter of right to work legislation who did not bother to ask the state AFL-CIO for an endorsement.
The AHCA eliminates cost sharing and offers a stingier tax credit to defray premium costs, likely resulting in higher overall health costs that may make insurance unaffordable for many people. (The CBO projected that 24 million more people would be without health insurance than under current law by 2026.)
That was the key driver for so many people from day one, Hill recalled of her campaign.
In response, the president and his team have been trying to reassure the public, holding regular news conferences on the outbreak. Anyone who wants a test can get a test, Trump said earlier this month, though that was later contradicted by other officials.

As Washington Post reporters David Nakamura and Seung Min Kim described it:
Let's recall that this CEA report was intended to rebut the need for cost-sharing reductions. Here's a line from the Politico report: Patrick Conway, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, points out his company would have kept 2018 premiums flat if Trump hadn't eliminated the cost-sharing subsidy. Instead, the insurer jacked up rates by an average of 13 percent to make up for the lost funding.
Harris insisted yesterday that Medicare-for-all isn't about socialism but about providing health care to all people.
Wagner shouted yes when Trump referred to paid family leave during his address to Congress. The reference also prompted applause from the crowd of House Democratic women clad in white, who sat in silence for much of the president's speech. The FAMILY Act has 160 co-sponsors in the House and 34 in the Senate — including every senator and representative seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
On Meet the Press, Chuck Todd played a clip from an interview Mike Pence gave to a local TV affiliate in Kasich's state. I'm very confident that this legislation will give Ohio both the resources and the flexibility that your governor, your legislature will need to be able to meet those needs going forward and literally offer our most vulnerable citizens even better coverage, the vice president said.
So what are we doing? Ryan added. We're going back and doing it incrementally. Going back at incremental health-care reform and other entitlement reforms so we can chip away at this problem.
SNL considers Ivanka complicit in her dad's misdeeds:
Ironically, Jeffrey Marrazzo, chief executive of Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics, said the company chose $425,000 per eye over concern from insurers that an even higher price point could trigger restrictions on patient access to the treatment. The drug, Luxturna, will serve as a one-time treatment to correct a faulty gene called RPE65 associated with the inherited disease. The disease is so rare that only 1,000 to 2,000 people in the United States are thought to have deteriorating vision due to it.
Castor, a lifelong Republican, has never met his new client in person, Karen Heller reports . The attorney was given little more than a week to prepare for the trial, but he doesn't think the case is particularly complicated.
The pilot HealthHUBs are part of CVS Health's approach following the $70 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna.
But some expansion foes are not buying the Trump-Pence appeal.
Every time you create a new fee-for-service benefit like this, you will have people who say, 'Cool, this is the way to improve care and reduce costs,' said Sean Cavanaugh, who directed Medicare's payment policies at the agency during the Obama administration. But then you also have the people who are like, 'This is a way for me to bill Medicare for more stuff.' 
Some food inspections have been halted amid the ongoing partial government shutdown, but others have continued operating with agency employees who are working without pay. Examples of activities being handled by unpaid workers include active investigations of foodborne illness outbreaks, dangerous recalls, import screening and safety inspections of foods imported from overseas, Politico's Helena Bottemiller Evich reports.
I'm trying to get around this, Durbin said, adding that it felt as if Barr was trying to ingratiate himself with the White House.
She'd also backed Clinton, in part because she said she disagreed with the social policies of the Republican Party. Her dislike of Trump went further.
They hoped, early on, that Lamb could change their fortunes. A first-time candidate from a storied local political family, the former Marine and federal prosecutor became a natural, if cautious, politician. He was personally antiabortion but opposed to new abortion restrictions; he supported the Second Amendment but favored stronger background checks.
Nearly two decades ago, Congress told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop rules for car seats that minimize children's head injuries in side-impact collisions. But regulators never created standards for the tests run on these products, allowing companies to devise tests that they knew they could pass, ProPublica writes.
House impeachment managers have spent the past three days demonstrating the extent of the peril they perceive. With the most comprehensive footage shown to date, they've painted a horrifying picture of mayhem and violence, and shown just how close various politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, came to being swallowed up by the mob.
President Trump's foray last week back into the world of Obamacare-repeal-and-replace is a terrain most Republicans clearly don't want to revisit. While they effectively leveraged that message in several elections after Democrats' 2010 health-care law, Democrats managed to switch the script last year by hounding the GOP over appearing to oppose protections for patients with preexisting conditions.
With this plan, everyone in our country—the anxious and the eager, the Old America and the New America—can unite and build a confident America, Ryan said of the House GOP agenda Friday morning.
Do not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they will be placed. (Trump followed through with this idea. But he did so not via legislation, but rather through executive order, and a federal appeals court recently blocked it.)
Trump repeatedly lambasted the fake news media — which at one point he upgraded (or downgraded) to the very fake news media — while promoting some dubious claims and fake news of his own.
Let's leave it at that. We have more to get to.
This is how the youngest U.S. Olympics speed skater prepares to win:
Going back four decades, there is evidence of more opposition back then — but the questions were different. A 1974 Time magazine poll asked whether people thought the country had moved dangerously close to socialism over the past 25 years. Three-quarters agreed, but 26 percent strongly agreed. A 1949 Gallup poll showed 14 percent wanted the country to move more in the direction of socialism, while 63 percent said they preferred going in the opposite direction.
Sanders's team says that no matter who is nominated, Republicans will smear that Democrat with the socialism label. That's whistling past the graveyard. Democrats have easily batted this spurious charge aside, because they ran on a mainstream progressive agenda. Sanders won't and can't. He has embraced the socialist label his entire political life, and his agenda, as he likes to point out, is far beyond anything Democrats have proposed on the national stage.
The plan Cox supports also would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults and co-pays. It would allow the state to pull out of expansion if the federal government reneged on its promise to pick up 90 percent of the $2 billion-a-year cost. And hospitals would foot the state's 10 percent share through a provider assessment.
By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.
-- Joshua Partlow interviewed the grandmother of Allison Ximena Valencia Madrid, the 6-year-old girl who can be heard in the ProPublica audio begging for her aunt: Ana Gloria Henríquez instantly recognized her granddaughter's sobs. … Since Monday, when the audio became public and Ximena was identified by ProPublica as one of the miserable children, Henríquez has been living a nightmare, unsure exactly where her daughter and granddaughter are being held and how they might be reunited.
This polarization is perhaps the single greatest weakness of the American political system today, a weakness that authoritarian rivals like Vladimir Putin's Russia have gleefully exploited. It is the subject of a superbly researched and written book by the journalist and commentator Ezra Klein, founder of Vox and host of a popular podcast. Klein argues that polarization exists for structural reasons having to do with the incentives created by U.S. institutions, and that our current predicament is not the result of individual leaders and the choices they make: It existed long before Trump took his famous ride down the escalator in Trump Tower and will unfortunately survive regardless of who is elected in November.
So far, they appear to be taking the idealist route when it comes to health care on everything from more coverage to tackling exorbitant prescription drug prices. They're introducing bills with no realistic chance of support from most Republicans. And yesterday they opted for politics over practicality, trying to zing Republicans over an anti-Obamacare lawsuit instead of passing measures that could actually halt it.
The House Veterans Affairs Committee holds a hearing on the Veterans Affairs budget request for 2020 on Wednesday.
Traditionally, in presidential years, the candidates still standing when AIPAC meets address the conference. Democrats are far from narrowing their presidential field; it would be a major break from the norm if their candidates don't speak next year.
Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?
With the trial expected to begin as soon as this week, there is no assurance that the Senate will subpoena witnesses or documents related to the Trump administration's campaign to force Ukraine to open an inquiry into presidential rival Joe Biden.

Open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. (Libel laws remain unchanged, despite Trump's frequent threats on this front.)
New sanctions 🚨: Biden also announced sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders ofollowing last week's coup.

The spending would be paid for with about $750 million in savings, including $107 million in unused Ebola funds, $100 million in cuts to administrative funding for the Department Health and Human Services and $534 million from unspent Obamacare money for health care exchanges in U.S. territories.
In a statement, Lee Gelernt, lead attorney and deputy director for the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said the policy was a cruel disaster from the start. Gelernt said the group will be back in court over this latest revelation.
He later blames his response on a faulty earpiece.
Biden, as a senator, was active in the anti-apartheid movement, helping pass sanctions on companies doing business in South Africa over President Ronald Reagan's veto. But there is no evidence that Biden was ever arrested trying to see the imprisoned future president of a democratic South Africa, fact checker Glenn Kessler writes. As far as we can tell, Biden never mentioned this arrest before; neither can we locate any news accounts of him being arrested.
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.
He has very strong opinions, but he just treats people well in every context, said Melissa Hart, a University of Colorado law professor. She is a Democrat who clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010.
— CMS Administrator Verma announced yesterday the agency will reject Kansas's request to limit people to three years of Medicaid coverage over their lifetime. The state had proposed Medicaid beneficiaries be allowed to remain under the KanCare Medicaid program for a three year maximum before being dropped.

Yang addresses his UBI idea: Yang was asked to defend his signature proposal — a payment of $1,000 a month, to every American, from the federal government. How would he pay for it?
Instead, executives tend to focus on more parochial company- or industry-specific issues. One administration official recalled a recent lunch he had with the head of one of the country's largest corporations. Every issue he brought up was about his own book of business, the official said.
Experts said the increases are quite significant for those programs, which have essentially had flat funding for the last couple decades, said Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. If finalized, the budget request would mark the first time in many years where the key U.S. HIV prevention & safety net care programs would see significant increases, she said in a tweet.
One way to avoid that problem would be to expand telehealth payments within special experiments (called demonstrations) conducted by CMS where participating hospitals are paid in lump sums based on the quality, not just the quantity, of services provided. Mercy Virtual participates in some of these demonstrations, which provide a pathway for Medicare to test better ways of paying providers.
Feb. 18, 2016. Anderson Cooper, during a CNN town hall, asked about Trump's plan to repeal Obamacare: Will people with preexisting conditions be able to get insurance? Trump's answer: Yes.
-- To be sure, getting rid of the electoral college is not a new idea. It's been discussed to varying degrees for nearly two centuries, and many prominent Democrats endorsed it after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost after the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. There's also no way a constitutional amendment to abolish it would pass before the 2020 election.
We definitely need some kind of New Deal, and it better be green, Hickenlooper said in an interview before his Manchester event. I think the key is really looking at the sequence in which you do things. What are the priorities? What's the maximum bang for the buck? Later, talking to a group of reporters, he said that he could probably support 99 percent of what's in the Green New Deal resolution but wanted to start any green policy by limiting methane emissions.
The changes that are being made are moving in the right direction, Helton said. The entire environment is moving towards supporting this.
— The Food and Drug Administration plans to preserve resources amid the partial government shutdown by furloughing more employees and suspending lower-priority tasks in order to shift money toward reviewing critical drugs, including new treatments for depression, diabetes and several types of cancer, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.
McConnell's former chief of staff and campaign manager predicted that Hunter Biden will wind up testifying if Democrats get Bolton:
As Trump emerged as a force in the Republican Party, friction between the two men grew.
Make the Hyde Amendment permanent. Since 1976, Congress has annually passed the Hyde Amendment, banning the use of federal dollars — in particular, Medicaid funds — for abortion, except in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life. (The Senate also voted against making the Hyde Amendment permanent.)
Which was, honestly, sort of a confusing ending. But that can happen after a long quest.
But one of Trump's campaign advisers suggested Wednesday that Trump might indeed change Social Security and Medicare — but only after he has been in office for a while. After the administration has been in place, then we will start to take a look at all of the programs, including entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Sam Clovis said during a public forum, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
Jan. 16. Politico hosts an event on health care innovators on
Further down Broadway, I spoke with Warren Cohen, 69, who explained his vote for Clinton in simple terms.
And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear. And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don't deliver on those promises.
Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.
Barrett said his company has implemented algorithms into its distribution system that stops suspicious orders automatically. I think we would do things very differently today, Barrett told the panel. We look at data, and if the data tells us there is an apparent pattern we simply stop.
She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.
But here's the funny thing: Health costs for employer-provided plans have grown much slower than expected since the Affordable Care Act was implemented. Experts debate whether the ACA played a significant role, but the average family premium is now almost $3,600 lower than if premium growth had kept pace with the rate in the decade before the law was passed, according to Kaiser.
It would take two Republicans to pass expansion on a budget vote in the Senate, which Republicans control by a 21-to-19 margin. But only one is needed to pass it as a budget amendment. That's because the Senate's presiding officer, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D), is allowed to break ties on budget amendments but not on the budget itself.
We believe that the current law has harmed many individuals, the secretary said.
OOF: Suicide rates rose in all but one state between 1999 and 2016, with increases seen across age, gender, race and ethnicity, according to a CDC report released yesterday. In North Dakota, the rate jumped more than 57 percent, but in the most recent period studied (2014 to 2016), the rate was highest in Montana, The Post's Amy Ellis Nutt reports. Only Nevada recorded a decline — of 1 percent — for the overall period, although its rate remained higher than the national average. In more than half of all deaths in 27 states, the people had no known mental health condition when they ended their lives.
And so we had all the Democrats — that's 48 Susan Collins voted no. That gave us 49. Lisa Murkowski voted no. That gave us 50. Those were all the known commitments.
It's unclear whether the plan would accomplish its goal of satisfying a range of the 35 GOP governors now in office, no matter the stance each has taken on expansion.
— First in Health 202: The nonpartisan public interest group Restore Public Trust is launching an ad campaign today characterizing HHS secretary Alex Azar as a pharmaceutical insider, highlighting how Eli Lilly raised drug prices during Azar's tenure there. The 30-second ad launched online today and will begin airing in D.C. on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC on Thursday. The ad is the first campaign of a longer-term effort by the group on drug pricing.
The divergence between the party's immigration pitch and stubborn general-election realities could create challenges, particularly in the Great Lakes states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which were all won narrowly by Trump in 2016.
When managers at the Phoenix VA hospital were found to have fudged wait lists for veterans' medical appointments in 2014, CVA was among the first groups to organize a rally in Arizona to call on Congress to investigate claims that dozens of patients may have died while waiting for care.
(UNKNOWN): About Afghanistan, you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.
The foundation also surveyed people about the Trump administration's goal of eliminating HIV within a decade. Just 8 percent said they had heard some or a lot about the administration's plans, but 56 percent said they are very or somewhat confident that the goal of eradicating HIV infections in the country is possible by 2030.
The Vice President's Office was informed today by the White House Medical Unit of the resignation, Alyssa Farah, the vice president's spokeswoman, said in a statement. Physicians assigned to the Vice President report to the White House Medical Unit and thus any resignation would go entirely through the medical unit, not the vice president's office.
— And here are a few more good reads:
4. And all that comes before the price tag and the potential drop in insurance rate
But no one really knows what this electoral environment will hold for either side. Gov. Scott Walker (R) is warning of a blue wave in Wisconsin of tsunami proportions. In April, Democrats won a state Supreme Court seat, and in January they won a state Senate special election deep in rural GOP territory. Ryan's departure after those losses is another morale blow for Republicans.
on Friday. The Heritage Foundation holds an event on mental illness
Ronald Reagan spoke out against Medicare in the 1960s but changed his tune by the 1980 campaign. The year he took office, he tried to reduce early retirement benefits for Social Security. But he backed off from that under public pressure.
But it's unclear how far along the agencies are in working on the framework, frustrating some humanitarian groups who say the administration should move faster in plans to administer vaccines around the world.
-- Trump's $4.8 trillion budget plan was met with disdain from Democrats, who said it would cripple low-income families. Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report: The budget plan sets up the Trump administration's policy priorities heading into the November election and is likely to draw scrutiny in Washington and on the campaign trail. Trump has in the past not shown much interest in pursuing the budget cuts his aides have offered, and he didn't make any public comments about the plan Monday. … [Instead], Russell Vought, acting White House budget director, touted the proposed spending increases in the budget for NASA, immigration, opioid mitigation and veterans, while saying they would not lead to benefit reductions for Medicare and Medicaid, as Democrats charged …
-- Other administration officials, meanwhile, continue to make promises that experts agree they will not be able to keep:
TRUMP: Now on -- let me explain that. You're right. Let me explain. First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.
In attacking the Affordable Care Act, Trump repeats a Four-Pinocchio whopper. Some 20 million people have gained health coverage because of the law. About 2 million people were told their old plans no longer qualified under the law, but after an uproar, most received waivers that kept the plans going until the end of 2017. In any case, anyone whose plan was terminated could buy new insurance.
Sinema chimed in on Twitter about the plan:
Jeremy Bruce, a physician in Cincinnati, followed the same protocol for almost every patient he treated for depression, first starting them on one kind of medication and switching to another until something seemed to help. But patients were leaving his practice angry before they found the right treatment, and Bruce explained that he started using patient DNA samples to find something more likely to work.
Heritage is a strong institution that has been here since the 1970s, said Brian Darling, a senior official at Heritage for seven years before leaving to join the staff of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) Jim DeMint did a tremendous job launching attacks on Obamacare and helping to confirm Justice Gorsuch. The organization changed under his leadership in ways that made some people uncomfortable. But the changes were in the margins and the organization will still stand strong and prosper in the future.
In a broader sense, Friday's raucous, six-hour hearing was a vivid reminder that time has run out for the Trump administration. For two years, the GOP majority shielded Trump administration incompetence and worse from public view. That ends now.
Next, experts say, assess your financial situation. Do you have money saved? Do you have any other sources of income? Take that all into account and make a new monthly budget. Use it as an opportunity to find out what expenses you can do without. Maybe you don't need a paid subscription to a music streaming service. Maybe you can cancel a gym membership.
While Trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency last fall -- and recently renewed the declaration -- there's no new funding available for the crisis, which killed about 64,000 people in 2016. Democrats are pushing for more opioid funding in a spending bill three weeks from now, but it's unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will uphold the alleged commitment he made toward that end.
The 60-second digital spot features audio from a 2011 radio interview in which the independent senator from Vermont said, I think it would be a good idea if President Obama faced some primary opposition. The spot ends with a narrator saying: When it comes to building on President Obama's legacy, Bernie Sanders just can't be trusted. The campaign said this is part of a $600,000 digital buy in South Carolina that will play on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.
-- As the summit approaches, experts weigh in on Trump and Kim's relationship. Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey report: 'Personal chemistry between leaders is clearly important,' said Victor D. Cha, the top North Korea adviser in the George W. Bush administration. But, he added, 'Is that personal relationship enough to create success in the policy? We are so far apart that the notion that the friendship alone would create a North Korean decision to give up all of their nuclear weapons is very hard to imagine.' Absent from Trump's messaging on North Korea over the past year has been any mention of human rights. The savagery of Kim and his government has been well documented and was once a rallying cry for Trump. But over the past year, Trump has said little publicly about Kim's barbarism, and officials said that in private the president has told confidants that he considers human rights in North Korea largely inconsequential to striking a denuclearization deal.
Could she get another job? Powers wonders. Not in her field at her age, she figures.
The CBO's findings about Obamacare come at an uncertain moment for the law. Congressional Republicans struck a key provision of the Affordable Care Act through their tax bill last year, eliminating the individual mandate, which penalizes Americans who do not buy health insurance. Subsequent congressional budget deals also delayed several of the law's tax increases, primarily on industry. But only one of those, the health insurance tax, was used for this CBO analysis, and it has already gone back into effect, according to Larry Levitt, a health expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
-- As opioid overdoses rise, police officers become counselors, doctors and social workers, by Katie Zezima: The nation's opioid epidemic is changing the way law enforcement does its job, with police officers acting as drug counselors and medical workers and shifting from law-and-order tactics to approaches more akin to social work. Departments accustomed to arresting drug abusers are spearheading programs to get them into treatment, convinced that their old strategies weren't working. They're administering medication that reverses overdoses, allowing users to turn in drugs in exchange for treatment, and partnering with hospitals to intervene before abuse turns fatal. Opioids now kill more people than car accidents, and in 2015 the number of heroin deaths nationwide surpassed the number of deaths from gun homicides. The expansion of the problem has forced officers to fundamentally rethink their work. Police must also work as front-line social-service providers in homes where children are present during an overdose. We're struggling to get them somewhere safe, said Capt. Ron Meyers of Chillicothe, Ohio. You could send them to grandma's house, but she's also a heroin addict. You have to vet everyone.
Insulin list prices have indeed skyrocketed over the past two decades. The average price of insulin nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013, according to the American Diabetes Association.
• Resurrect the semiautomatic weapons ban and another on high-capacity magazines. This time, Biden says, manufacturers wouldn't be allowed to skirt the law by making minor changes that don't limit the weapon's lethality, as was commonly done to undermine the effectiveness of the ban from 1994 to 2004.
His campaign, however, issued a lengthy statement decrying the candidates as far-left and socialist, particularly for the cries of some to end private health insurance. It has been part of their strategy — one Trump has not always adopted — to not elevate particular candidates and try to lump them together into one blob. Several of his advisers described the debate as not moving the needle and said they were looking more to Thursday night.
Kaiser Health News holds a discussion on living well with dementia on Feb. 13.
Sharpless, who was the National Cancer Institute director, said it was a privilege for me to now lead FDA, given this agency's long tradition of promoting innovation.
But that bit of politics aside, what Isakson says is important. In many ways, he makes the case about reverence for military service that other Republicans have declined to make in recent days.
-- Jill Biden helped push a heckler away from her husband during a New Hampshire event. A man, shouting as he recorded the moment on his phone, moved toward the candidate's lectern as the former vice president spoke. Jill Biden, who was seated close by, hopped up from her chair and stopped the protester before he got too close. When asked about the incident later, she laughed and said: I'm a good Philly girl. (CNN)
AHH: Vermont's Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill making the state the first in the country to legalize the import of prescription drugs from Canada. Overwhelmingly supported by the state's Democratic-controlled legislature, the measure is one of the most aggressive attempts by a state to tackle rising drug prices that critics say are crippling state finances, Politico's Rachana Pradhan reports. HHS still has to certify Vermont's program, she adds.
An international group of scientists with the WHO expected to travel to China shortly after the New Year to investigate the epicenter of the initial outbreak. The team had been working for almost a year to gain access to central Wuhan, but China has yet to finalize permissions for the trip, The Post's Emily Rauhala and Lily Kuo report. On Tuesday, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus issued a rare rebuke of China, expressing disappointment that the travel had not been approved.
Collins told the NIH Family in an email that he is deeply troubled that one of the graduate students was interrupted during a presentation and escorted from the NIH campus, and he said he sent an extended personal apology to that student. He added he learned of another non-U.S. citizen who had to miss the first day of a two-day meeting because of visitor clearance issues. I am also reaching out to that person to express regret.
Pence's favorite book is the Bible. Trump's was his book, The Art of the Deal, but now it, too, is the Bible.
One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.
But having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the Federalist Society's expanding sway. For one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. When Trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a Supreme Court justice. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with Trump's future White House counsel, Don McGahn (also a society member), and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The list was expanded twice to include Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and others. Leo took a leave from his job at the Federalist Society to advise the White House on the confirmation process for Gorsuch and Kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the George W. Bush White House in putting Roberts and Alito on the court.
Trump replaced the Defense Department's acting inspector general, Glenn Fine, on Tuesday — removing an official who had been slated to lead efforts to oversee his administration's management of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.
Still, the administration faces a big test as over 70 million additional taxpayers are eligible for relief, and many of those without bank accounts or direct deposit information on file could face lengthy delays.
But one thing's clear: Hospitals are forging ahead with virtual health-care, even if Medicare is not.
Democratic opposition and complex Senate rules mean that core pieces of the 2010 health-care overhaul are likely to remain, including the legal framework for the individual mandate and pieces of the state exchanges the law created. . . . The rush to immediately chip away at Obama's regulatory and domestic policies through the complex process known as budget reconciliation could create months of messy GOP infighting. The plan to vote now on repeal and work out the details later means Republican leaders will be slogging through the difficult process of writing a health-care replacement while simultaneously trying to scale back regulations in areas such as clean air and immigration, and possibly tackling a tax-code overhaul. It will be the first real test of how effective the GOP-controlled Congress will be.
Trump regularly cites his record number of judicial picks and his Supreme Court nominees as achievements — with the implicit understanding being that they will make decisions that Republicans favor. McConnell has also increasingly employed this approach.
Harris pressed: Would a wall help stop the flow of drugs over the border — a concern Barr had raised earlier in the hearing.
Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point. I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations. I don't think it's fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.
We'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, Trump vowed at the time, adding that Republicans would soon be known as the party of health care.
No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.
At a time when we're spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, when 87 million people are uninsured or underinsured, when 30,000 people are dying each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should, and when a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have, you know what? Sanders said at the December presidential debate.
TRUMP: Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not.
'Groups like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a frequent target of Trump's ire, are 'critically important,' Hogan added, expressing alarm about Trump 'not standing by or standing up for some of our allies.'

Like my shrink says, if it's hysterical, it's historical, Silverman says. My mom was kind of hard on me. And I don't know if it was frustration or jealousy. But I feel frustrated for her, because I feel like she could have been a Broadway director. She had so many dreams and they were just so crushed by every person around her.
Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.
TRUMP: That I can tell you.
I think the greatest opportunity to have a very palpable impact on people's lives is through trying to create greater access, Gottlieb said in a recent interview with The Health 202. The low-hanging fruit was on the generic drug side.
Look, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business, he didn't create it, Romney says. And whatever happened to Trump airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.
Why this matters: The latest figures come as Congress debates Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus package, which would extend unemployment benefits, issue $1,400 in direct checks and set aside hundreds of billions of dollars to fight the pandemic.
Some lawmakers, like Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), defended the magazine:
But critics of involuntary commitment, which include doctors and law enforcement officials, warn it could increase the risk of overdose for those who relapse. Expanding civil commitment laws, critics argue, could also violate due process rights, overwhelm emergency rooms and confine people in prisonlike environments, where treatment sometimes amounts to little more than forced detox without medications to help mitigate withdrawal symptoms, Philip writes. Researchers say there haven't been enough studies on whether such forced treatment is effective.
Thus far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Arizona Sen. Martha McSally (R) have issued tweets praising McCain, but without addressing Trump like Isakson did. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) joined Isakson in urging Trump to knock it off:
The New York Times's Margot Sanger-Katz:
But recent polls show that nationally, Democratic voters' enthusiasm gap over Republicans just narrowed as Trump's approval rating rises slightly. And the conservative candidate in this spring's statewide Supreme Court seat won Ryan's district by five points, comforting Republicans.
And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don't think that someone woke up one morning and said, Let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone.
The House's Energy and Commerce health subcommittee and its Education and Labor Committee met Wednesday in separate hearings to highlight a lawsuit against the ACA from GOP-led states that could ultimately wipe out its protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. The Ways and Means Committee held a similar hearing last week.
Political control R Reagan R Senate D House Why it happened House Democrats wanted nearly $1 billion in additional education funding and their foreign aid and defense spending did not align with Reagan's priorities.

That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the focus, Biden said, saying he wanted to deport those who committed major crimes.

I think our employer-based insurance system is facing a crisis that is related to escalating health care costs and the limited systems available to them to manage those costs, Commonwealth President David Blumenthal told reporters.
Biden's agenda — expanding Obamacare to achieve universal coverage, an ambitious green energy plan, tough gun regulations, comprehensive immigration reform, Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposals, triple funding for Title I schools that serve poor children, two years of free community college, etc. — is already quite progressive. It is progressive, but sane.
Using Pelosi's oft-repeated phrase — Diversity is our strength and unity is our power — Chamberlain said that when the speaker tries to marginalize some of the newest leaders who are fighting hard . . . it's not a good look and it's not a smart strategy.
End — end Common Core. Common Core should — it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end — education has to be local.
Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), whose office did not respond to request for comment, has only vaguely said he supports bipartisanship  when asked about eliminating the procedure.
Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.
We want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. So important. It's out of control. It's out of control.
Anthem's statement also emphasized continual changes in federal operations, rules and guidance and a shrinking individual market.
You can't -- for instance, let's say, on -- on the second question, you can't say it's OK, and then you find out it's not OK, and you don't want to do anything. You have to be flexible, because you learn. I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by -- you know -- I was asked by a number of people, actually. I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people. But by that time, the number had increased significantly.
They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse, Tlaib wrote, retweeting messages claiming Democrats used women of color as props. However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.
Northam, who ran for governor last year on a promise to expand Medicaid, said at an appearance in Richmond on Friday that he had seen no details about the stricter work requirement but had two concerns.
1. Crisis often – but not always – compels Congress to act
Ryan didn't and decided to bring the bill up for a vote anyway. It was a gutsy move on his part. Kinda like lawyers don't ask questions they don't already know the answer to, House leaders rarely bring a bill to the House floor without knowing what will happen, the better to avoid failures (and headlines) like this.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) peppered Wray with questions about whether right-wing groups like the Proud Boys, the Oathkeepers or the Ku Klux Klan were domestic terrorist groups.
From ABC's social media editor Evan McMurry:
But: Advocates acknowledge that a Medicare-for-all bill has never cleared a single committee, let alone Congress, though the bill has 109 co-sponsors in the House.
What we have to file is kind of assuming status quo, everything as it is will still be in place in 2018, Salciccioli said. It's my belief, or my hope at least, if something came down after we filed, they would at least hopefully allow us to take another look at rate increases and make adjustments after the fact.
Hanger has said he would supply that lone GOP vote if the House plan is changed to overcome his objections, which include a tax imposed on hospitals. In recent weeks, he has been working with the Northam administration, health insurers and hospital groups, and sounded optimistic.
The cracks were especially apparent yesterday, as a separate group of lawmakers gathered to re-introduce their own proposal to allow people to buy in to Medicare starting at age 50. That measure, offered by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.), would take a more incremental approach to expanding health coverage — one that could play better with voters who would stand to lose private coverage under a single-payer program.
A decision would not be likely until the spring or summer of 2021. The law remains in effect during the legal challenges.
WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Romney also talked about your position on race, and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday. You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I'd like to go deeper than that. What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan, and white supremacists?
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in an interview Thursday that he believes President Trump is a partner in enacting a conservative agenda. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)
He's also been responsible for approving a number of conservative judges to federal courts across the nation. Approving the president's judicial nominees is one of the Senate's primary constitutional jobs.
It's not going to be their plan, he said of people covered under the current law. It'll be another plan. But they'll be beautifully covered. I don't want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people, he said Saturday.
-- In a last-ditch effort, Trump called Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) late Thursday and said he backed the broad bill. Goodlatte delivered the president's message in a rushed, closed-door GOP meeting, but it did little to persuade opponents, Mike DeBonis, Sean Sullivan and John Wagner report. Key negotiators left the meeting more than an hour later and told reporters they would spend the coming days exploring whether they could find a way to add two elements of the hard-line bill — one requiring employers to screen workers for legal status using a federal database, another dealing with visas for agricultural workers — to the compromise in a bid to win more conservative votes. ... Conservatives have opposed the more moderate measure, believing that it amounts to 'amnesty' for the DACA 'dreamers' … Days of images and reports about children torn from their parents … has largely failed to change the internal dynamics.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tried to troll House impeachment managers during their presentation by reading this book on the Senate floor:
Romney wins the nomination. Trump endorses him repeatedly on Twitter. Romney loses the general election.
The purpose of this resolution is not for it to pass the House or the Senate or show up on the president's desk, said Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, whose November 2018 protest in Nancy Pelosi's office kicked off the Green New Deal debate. The purpose of it is a statement of principles. It's a vision document that lays out and turns out a blueprint for how we create the kind of policies that we need to stop the climate crisis and create good jobs in this country.
Family law experts said there could be ripple effects after the shutdown for non-custodial parents who already missed a child-support payment, making them vulnerable to administrative sanctions or even contempt of court, Samantha writes. Furloughed parents obligated by the state to pay child support could face back payments and administrative sanctions for missing a child support payment during the shutdown. Depending on the state, parents could theoretically lose their driver's licenses or professional licenses. Eventually some of these cases could find their way to the court for failure to pay child support on a timely basis.
This was the thinking that motivated my question to Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang about his monthly $1,000 check to every American he calls the Freedom Dividend. Metzl's book shows how difficult our nation's fraught and ongoing history with race will make Yang's policy goal difficult to achieve.
They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen.
There are just so many things to be outraged about, she said. Pressed for points of contention, she isolated Trump's efforts at deregulation. People say they're burdensome, she said. Well, maybe they are but we don't have 2-year-olds working because we have regulations against it. She lamented the effort to repeal Obamacare (a debacle) and Trump's attacks on the media.
Yet Trump's ownership of the GOP plan is not having the desired effect. It doesn't appear to be moving many Republicans — indeed, GOP critics of it appear to be hardening in their opposition — and a new poll out this morning finds that support for it is dropping.
The regs do say that Mueller is supposed to do a summary report of his prosecutive and his declination decisions, and they will be handled as a confidential document, as are internal documents related to any federal criminal investigation, said Barr, adding that the attorney general still has some flexibility and discretion in terms of the attorney general's report.
Joe Rice, co-lead counsel in the multidistrict case that combines 1,500 opioid suits in federal court in Cleveland told Alison: The issue is who are 'they,' what are they willing to settle, how, when, and for what consideration.
A week after Ivanka Trump extolled her father's virtues at the Republican convention, Chelsea Clinton, 36, bore witness for her mother. But unlike the very public Ivanka, this was an unusual role for Clinton, who has spent most of her adult life avoiding the spotlight.
5:10 p.m. Barr commits to supporting reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act
I'd say there is a great interest and willingness to reset a more constructive relationship, the head of one industry association said.
KELLY: Let me just set the record, and then you guys can have at it. There was Trump University, which was a business that you started, and it was marketed...
Third, Biden spoke up on behalf of Navy Capt. Brett Crozier, who was relieved of his command last week after complaining that his sailors were trapped on a ship as the coronavirus raged. I think it's close to criminal the way they're dealing with this guy, Biden declared in his interview. He said Crozier should get a commendation, not dismissal from his command. Biden comes down on the side of saving lives, not covering up problems. Trump continually punishes truth-tellers (e.g. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson) because his highest aim is making himself look good. Biden instead reminds us: A president creates an atmosphere where truth-telling is encouraged, and a leader's highest obligation is to look out for the people he or she has the responsibility to protect.
The academy recommends that children visit the doctor at least 14 times before they turn age 6. During those visits, they should receive speech, hearing and vision tests, as well as screenings for genetic disorders and the possible effects of trauma or toxic exposure.
Romney's proposal could help Biden incorporate policies with bipartisan support into his relief package. Senior Democrats have also pushed for direct financial stimulus for children as part of their $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal.
Many former DOJ officials criticized Barr's intake process to asses Giuliani's information about the Bidens:
The measure is among a variety of ways Republican-led states have tried to restrict abortion rights on the margins even as the 1973 Roe ruling prohibits them from banning the procedure entirely. Nearly all of the laws have been challenged, but only a few have won review by the Supreme Court (most prominently, a 2016 Supreme Court decision striking down some Texas requirements on abortion providers and the facilities they use).
TRUMP: Actually, it was for business. It was. It was. It was for business. I pride myself, including outside of the United States. I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the -- which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it -- but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.
No problem. The Trump White House can just come up with a set of alternative facts that show what a menace refugees really are.
-- Manchin said this morning that Hunter Biden could be a relevant witness. I think so, I really do, the West Virginia Democrat said on MSNBC's Morning Joe.
After more than 100 detainees took 10 hostages captive inside the prison in Talladega, Barr and other Justice Department officials tried to find a peaceful ending to the crisis, Hatch said. The detainees were Cubans who were angry they had been ordered sent back to that country.
So the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department came up with a regulation to make an exemption, allowing veterans and their dependents to choose whether to get VA coverage or enroll in coverage through the Obamacare exchange. They can choose to be on the exchange, and receive premium tax credits for it, even if they are eligible for VA care. As our friends at PolitiFact noted, the number of uninsured veterans declined significantly after Obamacare took effect.
It provided the foundation for her campaign, including early advertising about her husband suffering a collapsed lung just before they wed. They ended up $200,000 in debt because he was switching jobs and lacked health insurance.
There is a lot of scaremongering out there from both sides about a future president doing this or that and more levelheaded people on both sides realize that this is no way to run a government, Boyle told us. Congress has it's own interest, too. They don't like an executive to go around them so we see enough bipartisan support coming off of this.
-- The first votes in the New Hampshire primary were cast just after midnight. Mike Bloomberg took home an unexpected bipartisan win in Dixville Notch (with three write-in votes). Klobuchar was the popular choice in Hart's Location (where she got six votes) and Millsfield (where she got two) – the other New Hampshire locations that cast their ballots in the wee hours. From WMUR: Bloomberg got three write-in votes, one of which was a write-in vote in the Republican primary. It's a rarity in Dixville Notch for write-in votes. [Buttigieg and Sanders] each got one vote. The local tradition in Dixville Notch was put into jeopardy this year when it was learned that not enough people in the community were registered to vote. In order for the midnight vote to take place, Dixville Notch needed a minimum of five registered voters. In January, Dixville Notch got enough residents after the man behind the redevelopment project of the Balsams Resort officially moved to town and registered to vote. The only candidate to visit Dixville Notch prior to the vote was Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who failed to convince any of the five residents to support him.
The 2019 CMS Quality Conference continues in Baltimore.
After the House voted to impeach the president in December, McConnell's campaign knocked the Democrat for releasing a lengthy statement that did not say specifically whether she supported the House's move. (She later clarified that she did.)
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month also showed the law had its highest level of support since implementation — 48 percent favorable vs. 42 percent unfavorable.
But the GOP push to repeal Obamacare collapsed in the Senate, and Washington moved on to the battle over the tax bill. When the individual mandate yet again appeared to be on the chopping block, CBO in November 2017 published a budget estimate of the savings — which included what the impact would be on people with health insurance.
While we cannot speculate about Chairman Cummings's motives, we believe the Committee should not pursue an investigation to 'impact . . . stock prices with regard to drugs' — especially when there is bipartisan interest in real oversight of rising prescription drug prices.
Former vice president Joe Biden discussed his decision not to run for president in 2016, telling an audience at Colgate University that he believes he could have won. Do I regret not being president? Yes, he said.
-- Five Venezuelan soldiers who broke with Maduro and the nation's armed forces shared their stories with The Post, describing a government willing to shoot civilians. Dylan Baddour reports: Four defectors said they were compelled to leave the country after they were given orders to quash the protests, and one member of the special forces traveled from Caracas to escape during the demonstrations Saturday. They said they also opposed food supplies being rejected and burned while their families went hungry. … The defectors said that discontent in the ranks is high but that members of the armed forces are bound by fear. 'The order they gave us from high command is that, for whoever takes a step toward the bridge or who tries to leave post, they are authorized to shoot us,' said ­Piñera Martinez, 32, a sergeant deployed in San Antonio.
New virus cases in China and North Korea raised concerns about how long it could take to go back to normal.
The canard perpetrated by the left and carried by the gullible mainstream media is that Biden is hostile to the progressive agenda. Actually, he is the only conceivable vehicle for passing it, just as President Barack Obama was the one to fulfill the Democrats' decades-old goal of health coverage for non-elderly, able-bodied adults.
Foreign Policy, What Comes After ISIS? by Daniel Byman: The Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, is wrestling with how to balance vigilance and triumphalism. Trump, being Trump, is erring on the side of triumphalism, boasting about the Islamic State's defeat—to the consternation of the counterterrorism community, which wants to stay in Syria to keep the pressure on. It's appropriate to criticize Trump's boasting as premature, but it is also important to recognize that the Islamic State has been hit hard and that the caliphate's defeat marks a potential turning point. The foreign fighter flow has dried up, and the loss of territory makes it far harder for it to organize international terrorist attacks. The unusual circumstances that allowed the caliphate to briefly flourish may not soon recur, and it is unlikely that the Islamic State will soon revive at the same scale or that another front will emerge with the same appeal that Syria had. None of this, of course, means the end of jihadi terrorism.
And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.
A record number of more establishment House Republicans have decided to retire in the Trump era, at least one explicitly citing Trump as a reason.
Biden announced the plan a week after vowing that the United States will have enough vaccine to administer to all American adults by the end of May, Christopher Rowland and Isaac Stanley-Becker write.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) raised eyebrows last month when she said during a CNN town hall she'd like to get rid of private health insurance. The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through all the paperwork, all of the delay that may require, Harris said.
After eight years of playing defense on health care, Democrats were at last on offense. The public saw Democrats as protectors of Obamacare and awarded the party control of the House.
If there's any issue ripe for bipartisan work, it could be paid family leave. While the number of women in the workforce is at an all-time high, the United States remains the only developed country with no mandatory paid leave offered by employers.
Several factors provided a measure of political cover for House expanders. Among them is the failure of Republicans on the national level to repeal the ACA despite their control of Congress and the White House. If Obamacare remains the law of the land, some expanders say, there is no reason not to sign on.
So we have universities that have gone up two and a half times in cost over the last number of years. Have they improved two and a half times in quality? No. But everyday Americans look up and say, oh my gosh.
Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier, Buttigieg said. If undocumented immigrants paid into a broader health care system, it would help other Americans, he said, adding, This is not about a handout.
But several Senate Republicans reiterated their opposition to expansion in interviews with The Washington Post on Tuesday, on the eve of the special session.
McConnell is operating on the understanding that Collins and Murkowski are less prone to being swayed by pressure from Trump or other national political figures. They have cultivated reputations as independent senators willing to buck the national party in favor of the interests of their home states. So, McConnell will have to find a way to make the substance of the bill more appealing to them to win their votes.
Centene misrepresents the number, location, and existence of purported providers by listing physicians, medical groups, and other providers -- some of whom have specifically asked to be removed -- as participants in their network and by listing nurses and other non-physicians as primary care providers, claims the suit, which was filed on behalf of two Centene customers seeking class-action status to represent all customers of the insurer's Obamacare plans.
Sure, you say, savaging Clinton might work to unite Republicans. But that's not enough. What about how Trump's personal hits are perceived by the critical independent voter?
But Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said at a recent committee hearing that such policies are not required to cover tests or vaccines, which makes it much harder for people to get the care they need to keep this crisis under control.
At a roundtable organized by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a group of federal employees called on Trump to stop playing politics and put them back to work:
Seriously? Does Obama take up that much space inside Trump's head? Does the president stay up late at night sticking pins in an Obama voodoo doll?
The anguish that opioids have inflicted on so many individuals and families is tragic and deserves our serious attention, Tufts President Tony Monaco wrote in a letter to the university community. I strongly believe it is important to both our university and those who have suffered as a result of the opioid crisis to investigate these allegations thoroughly.
Congressional Republicans have long boasted that once they claim the reins of power, they will act quickly and decisively to roll back what they view as the most onerous piece of President Obama's domestic agenda: the Affordable Care Act.
In fact, there is a potentially large downside. The rules would also excuse association health plans from covering 10 classes of essential health benefits. Plans would probably be cheaper, but they would likely cover less than the comprehensive ones Obamacare sought to make the national standard. It is likely that some people who buy these plans will develop significant health problems and find themselves disastrously under-covered. Some may be willing to take that risk. The bigger problem is that opening a new avenue to buying shoddier insurance may harm everyone else seeking affordable, comprehensive coverage when they cannot get it from a large employer.
At the same time, the GOP approach would open a fresh spigot of aid for the states — all but one of which has a Republican governor — that eschewed the additional Medicaid money because of their elected officials' antipathy to the law. This extra aid would probably go to hospitals with a large share of poor and uninsured patients.
Democrats were also upset that the GOP legislation would prevent any Zika funding from being sent to Planned Parenthood. Republicans dropped language that would have barred the Confederate battle flag from being displayed at cemeteries run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Democrats also objected to a measure that would allow pesticides to be used to control mosquitos without a permit for 180 days.
We take a tremendous financial risk with Medicaid expansion, Black said.
-- Melania Trump made a surprise visit to a child immigrant shelter in McAllen, Tex. But the optics of her trip were quickly marred after she was seen boarding her flight from D.C. wearing a jacket that read, I Really Don't Care. Do U? Mrs. Trump, who did not wear the coat while touring the facility in Texas, was again wearing the jacket when she deplaned in Maryland, headed back to the White House, Emily Heil reports. The choice seemed deliberate: It was 80 degrees and humid and the coat had been a topic of controversy for hours. The controversy was [especially] surprising since Melania Trump, a former fashion model, is particularly attuned to visuals, including her sartorial choices. She is known for carefully selecting her clothing to match the moment … It wasn't just the media who focused on the jacket. Immigration-reform advocate David Leopold said he first assumed, when a friend sent him the photos, that it was an altered photo intended to be a joke. When he realized it wasn't, he said he was shocked.
More than anything he said, though, it was the passion and disruption that Sanders oozed from every pore over the two hours that should push Democrats on the fence about the race into his camp. Sanders effectively positioned himself as the anti-status-quo candidate, a very good position to have in this electoral environment.
As far as I'm aware, the president says he's still under audit, said the senator, excusing Trump.
-- Bloomberg doesn't want Silicon Valley's money, but he did call up hundreds of tech leaders and asked them to refer their most talented employees. From Vox: The request made plain Bloomberg's comfort with — and, in some ways, dependence on — the Silicon Valley companies that have been persistently criticized during the 2020 Democratic primary. … On the Monday call, [former Foursquare CEO Jeff] Glueck said he needed the tech leaders to pitch jobs on the Bloomberg campaign to 'your most talented friends' and 'send them our way,' especially those with expertise in data science, internet marketing, advertising buying and analytics.
