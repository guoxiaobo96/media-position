below, we're posting the full prepared speech and analyzing with our annotations. to see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text.\n\nmr. speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states, and citizens of america:\n\nad\n\ntonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of black history month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. recent threats targeting jewish community centers and vandalism of jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in kansas city, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\n\nad\n\neach american generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice — in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\n\nthat torch is now in our hands. and we will use it to light up the world. i am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\n\nad\n\na new chapter of american greatness is now beginning.\n\na new national pride is sweeping across our nation.\n\nand a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\n\nwhat we are witnessing today is the renewal of the american spirit.\n\nour allies will find that america is once again ready to lead.\n\nall the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that america is strong, america is proud, and america is free.\n\nin nine years, the united states will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding — 250 years since the day we declared our independence.\n\nad\n\nit will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\n\nbut what will america look like as we reach our 250th year? what kind of country will we leave for our children?\n\nad\n\ni will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\n\nfor too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\n\nwe've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of chicago, baltimore, detroit — and so many other places throughout our land.\n\nwe've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross — and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\n\nand we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthen, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. the rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds — families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\n\nbut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus — as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\n\nfinally, the chorus became an earthquake — and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that america must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly make america great again.\n\nad\n\ndying industries will come roaring back to life. heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\n\nour military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\n\nad\n\ncrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\n\nour terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\n\nand our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.\n\nabove all else, we will keep our promises to the american people.\n\nit's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and i want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress i've made in keeping those promises.\n\nad\n\nsince my election, ford, fiat-chrysler, general motors, sprint, softbank, lockheed, intel, walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the united states and will create tens of thousands of new american jobs.\n\nthe stock market has gained almost 3 trillion dollars in value since the election on november 8th, a record. we've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new f-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government. we have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.\n\nad\n\nwe have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials — and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\n\nad\n\nwe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\n\nwe have cleared the way for the construction of the keystone and dakota access pipelines — thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs — and i've issued a new directive that new american pipelines be made with american steel.\n\nwe have withdrawn the united states from the job-killing trans-pacific partnership.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwith the help of prime minister justin trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\n\nto protect our citizens, i have directed the department of justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime.\n\ni have further ordered the departments of homeland security and justice, along with the department of state and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation.\n\nwe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth — and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\n\nat the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security. by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. we want all americans to succeed — but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. we must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\n\nad\n\nfor that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. it will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\n\nas we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. bad ones are going out as i speak tonight and as i have promised.\n\nto any in congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, i would ask you this question: what would you say to the american family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because america refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\n\nour obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the united states. we are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical islamic terrorism.\n\nad\n\naccording to data provided by the department of justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. we have seen the attacks at home — from boston to san bernardino to the pentagon and yes, even the world trade center.\n\nwe have seen the attacks in france, in belgium, in germany and all over the world.\n\nit is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. those given the high honor of admission to the united states should support this country and love its people and its values.\n\nwe cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside america — we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\n\nthat is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe — and to keep out those who would do us harm.\n\nas promised, i directed the department of defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy isis — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered muslims and christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and beliefs. we will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\n\ni have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of israel.\n\nfinally, i have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the united states supreme court — from my list of 20 judges — who will defend our constitution. i am honored to have maureen scalia with us in the gallery tonight. her late, great husband, antonin scalia, will forever be a symbol of american justice. to fill his seat, we have chosen judge neil gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. he was confirmed unanimously to the court of appeals, and i am asking the senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\n\ntonight, as i outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\n\nninety-four million americans are out of the labor force.\n\nover 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million americans are on food stamps.\n\nmore than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\n\nwe have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\n\nin the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other presidents combined.\n\nwe've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since nafta was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since china joined the world trade organization in 2001.\n\nour trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.\n\nand overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\n\nsolving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. it will require us to tap into the american spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\n\nbut to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the american economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the united states, and much harder for companies to leave.\n\nright now, american companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\n\nmy economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. at the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\n\nwe must create a level playing field for american companies and workers.\n\ncurrently, when we ship products out of america, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into america, we charge them almost nothing.\n\ni just met with officials and workers from a great american company, harley-davidson. in fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the usa, on the front lawn of the white house.\n\nat our meeting, i asked them, how are you doing, how is business? they said that it's good. i asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. they told me — without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it — that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. they said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\n\nthey weren't even asking for change. but i am.\n\ni believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.\n\nthe first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\n\nlincoln was right — and it is time we heeded his words. i am not going to let america and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore.\n\ni am going to bring back millions of jobs. protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. the current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\n\nnations around the world, like canada, australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. it is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. yet, in america, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. according to the national academy of sciences, our current immigration system costs america's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\n\nswitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class.\n\ni believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.\n\nif we are guided by the well-being of american citizens then i believe republicans and democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\n\nanother republican president, dwight d. eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program — the building of the interstate highway system. the time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\n\namerica has spent approximately $6 trillion in the middle east, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. with this $6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country — twice. and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\n\nto launch our national rebuilding, i will be asking the congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the united states — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs.\n\nthis effort will be guided by two core principles: buy american, and hire american.\n\ntonight, i am also calling on this congress to repeal and replace obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care.\n\nmandating every american to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for america. the way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\n\nobamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. as an example, arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. governor matt bevin of kentucky just said obamacare is failing in his state — it is unsustainable and collapsing.\n\none-third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges — leaving many americans with no choice at all.\n\nremember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\n\nwe now know that all of those promises have been broken.\n\nobamacare is collapsing — and we must act decisively to protect all americans. action is not a choice — it is a necessity.\n\nso i am calling on all democrats and republicans in the congress to work with us to save americans from this imploding obamacare disaster.\n\nhere are the principles that should guide the congress as we move to create a better health-care system for all americans:\n\nfirst, we should ensure that americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the health-care exchanges.\n\nsecondly, we should help americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.\n\nthirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\n\nfourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance — and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\n\nfinally, the time has come to give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines — creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\n\neverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. every problem can be solved. and every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\n\nour citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces to finally get it done? on this and so many other things, democrats and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the american people.\n\nmy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n\ntrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every american child who deserves a brighter future.\n\nan incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\n\ntoday is rare disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, megan crowley. megan was diagnosed with pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. she was not expected to live past 5.\n\non receiving this news, megan's dad, john, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. he founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved megan's life. today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at notre dame.\n\nmegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.\n\nbut our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved megan's life, from reaching those in need.\n\nif we slash the restraints, not just at the fda but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like megan.\n\nin fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\n\nbut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every american child.\n\neducation is the civil rights issue of our time.\n\ni am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of african-american and latino children. these families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\n\njoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, denisha merriweather. as a young girl, denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. but then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\n\nwe want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like denisha.\n\nbut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\n\nthe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\n\nin chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone –- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\n\nthis is not acceptable in our society.\n\nevery american child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\n\nbut to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement.\n\nwe must build bridges of cooperation and trust –- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\n\npolice and sheriffs are members of our community. they are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.\n\nwe must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n\nand we must support the victims of crime.\n\ni have ordered the department of homeland security to create an office to serve american victims. the office is called voice –- victims of immigration crime engagement. we are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\n\njoining us in the audience tonight are four very brave americans whose government failed them.\n\ntheir names are jamiel shaw, susan oliver, jenna oliver, and jessica davis.\n\njamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. jamiel shaw jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. but he never got the chance. his father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\n\nalso with us are susan oliver and jessica davis. their husbands –- deputy sheriff danny oliver and detective michael davis –- were slain in the line of duty in california. they were pillars of their community. these brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\n\nsitting with susan is her daughter, jenna. jenna: i want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\n\nto jamiel, jenna, susan and jessica: i want you to know –- we will never stop fighting for justice. your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\n\nfinally, to keep america safe we must provide the men and women of the united states military with the tools they need to prevent war and –- if they must –- to fight and to win.\n\ni am sending the congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in american history.\n\nmy budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\n\nour veterans have delivered for this nation –- and now we must deliver for them.\n\nthe challenges we face as a nation are great. but our people are even greater.\n\nand none are greater or braver than those who fight for america in uniform.\n\nwe are blessed to be joined tonight by carryn owens, the widow of a u.s. navy special operator, senior chief william ryan owens. ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our nation.\n\ni just spoke to general mattis, who reconfirmed that, and i quote, ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. for as the bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him.\n\nto those allies who wonder what kind of friend america will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\n\nour foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. it is american leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\n\nwe strongly support nato, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war that defeated communism.\n\nbut our partners must meet their financial obligations.\n\nand now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\n\nwe expect our partners, whether in nato, in the middle east, or the pacific –- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\n\nwe will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\n\nfree nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people –- and america respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. my job is not to represent the world. my job is to represent the united states of america. but we know that america is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\n\nwe must learn from the mistakes of the past –- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\n\nthe only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\n\namerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. we want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\n\nwe want peace, wherever peace can be found. america is friends today with former enemies. some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these world wars. this history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\n\nhopefully, the 250th year for america will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\n\non our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to philadelphia to celebrate america's centennial. at that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\n\nalexander graham bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\n\nremington unveiled the first typewriter. an early attempt was made at electric light.\n\nthomas edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\n\nimagine the wonders our country could know in america's 250th year.\n\nthink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\n\ncures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\n\namerican footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\n\nmillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\n\nand streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\n\nwhen we have all of this, we will have made america greater than ever before. for all americans.\n\nthis is our vision. this is our mission.\n\nbut we can only get there together.\n\nwe are one people, with one destiny.\n\nwe all bleed the same blood.\n\nwe all salute the same flag.\n\nand we are all made by the same god.\n\nand when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of american greatness began.\n\nthe time for small thinking is over. the time for trivial fights is behind us.\n\nwe just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\n\nthe bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\n\nand the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\n\nfrom now on, america will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears –-\n\ninspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past –-\n\nand guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\n\ni am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the american spirit. i am asking all members of congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. and i am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --\n\nbelieve in yourselves.\n\nbelieve in your future.\n\nand believe, once more, in america.\n\nthank you, god bless you, and god bless these united states.
this is a small step but an important step in the right direction, said grant smith, deputy director of national affairs for the drug policy alliance. if, in fact, it's going towards boosting our treatment capacity, that is certainly a welcome development.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe deal, which has strong support in the senate but may have a harder time passing the house today, would add more than $500 billion in federal spending over the next two years, delivering the military funding boost sought by president trump alongside the increase in domestic programs sought by democrats, the post's erica werner and mike debonis report. with a government shutdown deadline looming at midnight, the accord holds the promise of breaking a months-long partisan standoff centered on federal spending, though roadblocks remain, they write.\n\nthe measure's modest sum for opioids, to be spent over two years and allocated by congressional appropriators, is nonetheless congress's largest investment yet toward fighting opioid addiction and overdose, a problem now so massive that it claims the lives of more americans every year than car accidents.\n\ntwo bipartisan bills lawmakers passed in 2016 — one aimed at speeding the discovery of medical cures and another aimed at addiction — tossed a little more than $1 billion toward the problem. congress didn't provide any additional funding last fall after president trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, much to the chagrin of health advocates who have been highlighting major shortcomings in the health-care system's ability to help addicted americans.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin that context, this new $6 billion infusion is the best indication yet that lawmakers and policy wonks are serious about making opioid abuse a top issue.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.):\n\nsenate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.):\n\nsen. robert p. casey jr. (d-pa.):\n\nsen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.):\n\nsen. sheldon whitehouse (d-r.i.):\n\nevery day approximately 11 ohioans die from unintended drug overdoses, sen. rob portman (r-ohio) said in a statement. this crisis is overwhelming ohio and our country. the funding in this proposal would be another important step in the fight against this epidemic.\n\nad\n\nthe text of the spending measure includes enhancements to grants to improve well-being of families affected by substance abuse. it would be up to members of the house and senate appropriations committees to more specifically direct the dollars through the regular budget process.\n\nsome lawmakers and activists stress the importance of spending the money in smart ways by sending it to the highest-need areas and investing in evidence-based practices proven to help those struggling with drug addiction.\n\na spokesman for sen. joe manchin told me that while the west virginia democrat is pleased with the new funding stream, he's concerned with making sure his state gets a fair share of the dollars give it has the highest rates of drug abuse in the nation. manchin, up for reelection this year in a state won by trump, is also well-placed to weigh in, as he sits on the senate appropriations committee.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe still don't know how much west virginia is going to get, manchin spokesman jonathan kott told me. he is going to make sure west virginia gets as much as possible.\n\nmanchin would also be more enthused if lawmakers would dedicate a permanent funding stream to opioid abuse, as he's proposed in a bill dubbed the lifeboat act, which would extract fees from the makers of prescription opioids to pay for substance-abuse treatment.\n\naddiction experts also say they're worried about ensuring the money is directed to treatment supported by evidence – like medications helping those addicted wean off drugs paired with counseling – instead of pouring more money into law-enforcement tactics favored by attorney general jeff sessions, many of which appeared to be ineffective during the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand, of course, advocates feel that $6 billion isn't nearly enough to address the crisis fully – although convincing a gop-led congress to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars some have suggested would be a tall order.\n\nit's too vague and it's not enough money, said andrew kolodny, a professor at brandeis university, who says he thinks congress should spend at least $12 billion over two years.\n\neven if they want to spend it exactly as i think they should, it wouldn't be enough, he said.\n\nsome democrats also urged more must be done. sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.):\n\nhealth on the hill\n\n--we're keeping our eyes on the house today, where it's still unclear whether republicans can pass the spending agreement without any help from democrats. the measure would increase what's called discretionary spending — areas such as scientific research, education, roads and health care that are funded year-to-year by appropriations — by 21 percent over existing budget caps, irking some conservatives who are warning it would set up trillion-dollar-a-year deficits.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nopioid funding is just one bullet point in a list of health-care priorities included in the potential deal. a few of the other biggies:\n\n—extending the children's health insurance program for an additional four years (on top of the six years congress authorized in its short-term spending deal last month, making for a total of 10 years before the issue must be dealt with again.)\n\n—boosting national institutes of health funding by $2 billion.\n\n—funding community health centers for two years (we have written extensively on this issue, most recently here.)\n\n—repealing the affordable care act's independent payment advisory board, a medicare cost-cutting board that has never actually been implemented but which republicans have slammed for years.\n\nad\n\n—closing the medicare part d doughnut hole for seniors in 2019.\n\nad\n\nsenate democrats:\n\nlarry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation, noted congress doesn't seem terribly concerned with policies to help rein in health-care spending. the deal repeals ipab and and delays the cadillac tax on high-cost health plans (two parts of the aca intended to do just that):\n\npolitico's jennifer haberkorn noted a glaring omission in the budget deal: neither of the bipartisan marketplace stabilization measures to help insurers lowers the cost of obamacare

health policy finds in a new report. the post's amy goldstein reports overall signups stayed essentially level from the year before -- while enrollment fell by an average of 5 percent in the states using the federal-run healthcare.gov website. and who did best of all? the five states with hybrid federal-state marketplaces.\n\nad\n\nad\n\noverall enrollment was surprisingly resilient despite the trump administration's rollbacks of advertising for the marketplaces. the report shows that almost 11.8 million americans chose aca health plans for this year — just a half-million fewer than for 2017 and about 900,00 fewer than in 2016, amy notes. but there are several reasons why state-run marketplaces tended to fare better than the federal ones: some of them extended enrollment beyond the federal six-week sign-up season and some states chose to run robust advertising programs.\n\nthe states live in a period of uncertainty, so when you see stable enrollment, it's good, said trish riley, nashp's executive director. despite repeated assertions by trump that the marketplaces are essentially dead, the message is, people want coverage, and they came and got it, riley said.\n\noof: robin williams's suicide in august 2014 appears to be linked with a nearly 10 percent spike in the number of suicides in the united states in the following five months. our colleague amy ellis nutt reports on a study finding the increase was especially marked among men ages 30 to 44, whose suicide rate rose nearly 13 percent. even more notably, there was a more than 32 percent spike in the number of suicides by suffocation, which is how williams died.\n\nad\n\nanalyzing monthly mortality statistics from the centers for disease control and prevention, researchers at columbia university estimated that the number of suicides from august to december 2014 should have been 16,849, amy reports. instead, the number was 18,690, representing an additional 1,841 cases.\n\nlahrs mehlum, the director of norway's centre for suicide prevention, said the media's portrayal of williams's death may have played a role. sadly, there were all too many examples of unfortunate presentations of the case of robin williams' suicide, mehlum said. many journalists failed to mention the huge health problems williams struggled with (both mentally and physically), but rather portrayed a glorified version of the event. this is not according to international guidelines for media reporting of suicide.\n\nouch: republican lawmakers are threatening to withhold u.s. funding for the world health organization's cancer-research program, charging that its 2015 finding that monsanto's herbicide roundup could cause cancer in humans is flawed and biased, the ap reports. house science committee chairman lamar smith (r-tex.) said yesterday the finding is fundamentally flawed, relying on cherry-picked science and demonstrating anti-industry bias, citing a separate epa review in december that glyphosate, the active ingredient in roundup and other products, is not likely to cause cancer at typical levels of exposure.\n\nthere are real repercussions to iarc's unsubstantiated claims, which are not backed by reliable data, smith said at a hearing. labeling requirements will drive costs up for farmers and consumers and create unjustified public fear.\n\ntrump temperature\n\n-- meghan mccain says trump told

1. who controls a 50-50 senate?\n\nthe party of the vice president, who acts as president of the senate and breaks ties when they occur. that will be the democratic party after biden is inaugurated as president and kamala harris becomes vice president. her tie-breaking vote assures the top senate democrat, chuck schumer, will become majority leader. (the senate technically has 48 democrats and two independents, bernie sanders of vermont and angus king of maine, who reliably vote with them.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. has this happened before?\n\nrarely, but yes. the last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a republican, dick cheney. that 50-50 split ended after six months when a republican senator, jim jeffords of vermont, switched parties, giving democrats a 51-49 advantage. there also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the senate historical office calls the great senate deadlock of 1881.\n\n3. who leads senate committees?\n\nthe majority party assigns a chairman for each of the senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. but when the senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its republican and democratic leaders -- trent lott of mississippi and tom daschle of south dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, equal budgets for committee republicans and democrats, and the ability of both leaders to advance legislation out of committees that are deadlocked. a similar power-sharing arrangement might be reached after jan. 20.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n4. what can democrats do with 50 senate votes?\n\nthough a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. among biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for medicare and expanding obamacare. reconciliation could also empower democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by republicans as well as portions of biden's climate and immigration priorities. the congressional review act also will enable democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the trump administration with simple majorities. democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.\n\n5. what limits will democrats face?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrepublicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. that means the narrow democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. and with the slimmest possible majority, democrats will have to stick together. a single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.\n\n6. who is key to keeping the 50 senate democrats together?\n\nschumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative democrats such as joe manchin of west virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.\n\n7. are there republicans who might vote with democrats?\n\namong the republicans who early on recognized biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are utah's mitt romney, maine's susan collins and alaska's lisa murkowski.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
ad\n\nit's an idea moderate democrats are wary of, for a host of reasons.\n\ni've talked to a lot of people that support medicare-for-all, freshman rep. donna shalala (d-fla.), who served as health and human services secretary under president bill clinton, told me. i said i wanted to do medicaid-for-all. that's a better program.\n\nad\n\nas we've noted before, democrats advocating for medicare-for-all face challenging questions about exactly how they'd fold more people into the program, how it would be paid for and what benefits would be covered. if the goal is more generous benefits, medicaid could be a more obvious model than medicare, experts say.\n\nthere are several categories of medical benefits covered only minimally by medicare or not at all, including long-term care, mental-health services and most dental care. enrollees in medicaid, by contrast, can access a pretty comprehensive array of inpatient and outpatient services. medicaid plans cover not only all 10 of the health benefits considered essential under the affordable care act but also nursing home care and long-term care services.\n\ni think a big challenge is people don't really have a concept of how little medicare offers, said matt salo, executive director of the national association of medicaid directors. medicare has made a huge difference in the lives of many people over the years, but it falls short in a lot of areas.\n\nas his colleagues have rolled out scores of different medicare-for-all-style bills, sen. brian schatz (d-hawaii) has proposed the state public option act, which would allow people to use obamacare subsidies to buy a medicaid-type plan offered in the individual marketplaces.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nof course, this is essentially the same idea as offering a government public option plan on the marketplaces — an idea democrats tried to advance as part of the aca but eventually abandoned after strong opposition from republicans.\n\nand there's another potential obstacle. the health-care industry, already up in arms over medicare-for-all proposals, probably would hate the idea of medicaid-for-all even more because the program reimburses health-care providers at even lower rates than for medicare services.\n\nmedicaid has also been the target of criticism and targeted changes from officials because it benefits those on the lower end of the income scale, offering services for americans earning only up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that threshold is lower in states that haven't expanded medicaid under the aca). shalala made this observation, too: fewer capitol hill staffers specialize in medicaid policy compared to medicare policy, since medicaid is run by the states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere are just a handful of experts on medicaid care in congress, and most of them have retired, shalala said.\n\nyet there are some reasons to think expanding medicaid could stand a better chance of gaining wider acceptance than growing medicare, as my colleague colby itkowitz explained here. medicaid is a program run by states — something republicans favor — plus a number of gop governors have embraced medicaid expansion under the aca.\n\nheather howard, a lecturer at princeton university who also helps states with their health-care systems, told colby that 14 states across the country have made moves to at least weigh the benefits and challenges of making medicaid widely available to higher-income earners.\n\nad\n\nwhy medicaid? schatz wrote in a usa today piece touting his bill. frankly, this program — already serving 69 million people — is underrated. it has a large provider network and the same ratings as private insurance but at a much lower cost to the government … medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.\n\nad\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: president trump has nominated his former doctor rear adm. ronny l. jackson to be promoted to two-star admiral and to be his chief medical adviser.\n\nthe president previously nominated jackson to lead veterans affairs, but the doctor withdrew his nomination over allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, claims still under investigation by the pentagon, our post colleagues dan lamothe and josh dawsey report.\n\nad\n\na navy spokeswoman, lt. christina sears, said jackson is still assigned to the white house, they write. the navy originally submitted jackson's name for promotion last year before trump nominated him to be va secretary, and the white house resubmitted it, she said.\n\nthey also report trump still likes jackson and believes he has been unfairly treated, according to a white house official.\n\nad\n\nbecause an investigation of jackson is ongoing, it's not clear whether the senate armed services committee will move on his new promotion nomination.\n\nfollowing the president's nomination of jackson to head va last year, sen. jon tester (d-mont.), the ranking member of the veterans' affairs committee, released a two-page memo of allegations against jackson, claiming he drank on the job, freely handed out medication, and created a hostile workplace. the white house disputed the most serious of the claims, our colleagues report.\n\noof: in an effort to increase sales and push higher dosages of the painkiller oxycontin, massachusetts attorney general maura healey alleges members of the sackler family that owns purdue pharma engaged in acts of deception and misconduct, our post colleagues katie zezima and lenny bernstein report.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin parts of the lawsuit, healey paints a portrait of insatiable greed and disregard for the suffering that the company's main product had caused, they write.\n\nemails released as part of massachusetts' lawsuit against the drugmaker reveal how the family pushed the products. in one email, former purdue president richard sackler personally directed sales representatives to push doctors to prescribe extremely high doses of opioids, our colleagues report, even as healey claims the family knew such a move would put patients at risk.\n\npurdue spokesman robert josephson criticized the massachusetts lawsuit, calling it part of a continuing effort to single out purdue for the opioid crisis, calling the idea that purdue had only tried to push high doses of oxycontin a fictional narrative.\n\nouch: the controversy surrounding a failed measure in virginia that sought to loosen restrictions on late-term abortions has reawakened a fierce debate, and partly disrupted plans by abortion-rights advocates to push initiatives and make it a defining issue heading into the 2020 elections, our post colleagues annie linskey and ariana eunjung cha report.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nabortion-rights supporters have made recent moves to push for state-based laws protecting access to abortion and expanding access to birth control and reproductive care. the intensified efforts are a response to the addition of conservative brett m. kavanaugh to the supreme court, prompting concerns the new conservative majority would reverse roe v. wade. in new york, where democrats won full control of the state government in november, the first measure of 2019 expanding abortion rights was enacted. other efforts are underway in rhode island and new mexico, annie and ariana write.\n\nbut when virginia gov. ralph northam (d) weighed in on the controversial virginia measure, he turned the focus from the protection of abortion rights in general to the debate over late-term abortion. annie and ariana report that while abortion opponents routinely try to turn the conversation to late abortions, abortion rights advocates often keep their focus on early, more accepted procedures. the debate about the new bills sought in multiple states proceeded along those lines, until the explosion of attention to northam's comments.\n\nthis is part of an organized attempt to create fear in other places and chill the effects of passing legislation, laura mcquade, the president and ceo of planned parenthood new york city, told our colleagues. it is sexy for the right. they are trying to shut down other laws.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstate scan\n\ndemands for virginia gov. ralph northam (d) to resign intensified on feb. 3, after a racist 1984 yearbook photo was released. (elyse samuels/the washington post)\n\n— meanwhile, northam faces calls for his resignation over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. the tip to the reporter who exposed the photo on northam's yearbook page appears to have come from a medical school classmate or classmates of the governor's who were concerned following the abortion controversy in the state last week, our post colleague paul farhi reports.\n\ntwo people at the website big league politics told paul about the tip. the revelations about ralph northam's racist past were absolutely driven by his medical school classmate's anger over his recent very public support for infanticide, one of the two told our colleague.\n\nnortham quickly apologized but at a news conference on saturday, he reversed himself and said he was not in the photo and didn't know how it got on his yearbook page.\n\nnortham called a senior staff meeting on sunday as he considered his options, including resignation, our post colleagues gregory s. schneider, laura vozzella and jenna portnoy report. a larger meeting is scheduled for this morning as national democratic leaders call on the governor to resign.\n\nin a weekend

challengers say would leave the state with only one doctor eligible to perform abortions.\n\nthe court ruled friday the law could not be implemented before thursday, our post colleague robert barnes reports.\n\nbecause the filings regarding the application for a stay in this matter were not completed until earlier today and the justices need time to review these filings, the decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit is temporarily stayed, justice samuel a. alito jr. wrote.\n\nthe law in question requires a doctor providing abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the procedure. a similar law in texas was struck down by supreme court in a 5-to-3 vote in 2016.\n\nbut last fall, a panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit in new orleans upheld the louisiana law in a 2-to-1 vote, finding factual distinctions between how the restriction played out in texas and louisiana, robert writes. the full court, considered one of the most conservative of the regional appeals courts, voted not to reconsider the panel's decision.\n\ntrump temperature\n\n— during the state of the union address, trump is planning to pledge to end the hiv epidemic in the country within the next decade or so, politico's dan diamond reports.\n\nthe administration's plan includes health officials working toward reducing hiv transmissions by 2030 by concentrating efforts in communities with the most hiv infections, dan writes. he also reports trump's remarks have not been finalized and the plan for tuesday evening's address could change.\n\nthe state of the union historically has been a platform for presidents to make bold public health proclamations — many of which haven't come to pass. former president barack obama used his final address in january 2016 to call for an end to cancer, dan writes. the strategy was heavily shaped by [cdc director robert redfield], a prominent aids researcher who was tapped to lead the cdc last year.\n\nlast year, redfield said at an agency meeting that ending the epidemic by 2025 is possible with the use of public health tools like a push for more widespread condom use, dan writes.\n\n— president trump predicted obamacare will be terminated, suggesting the lawsuit brought by texas and other republican-led states to overturn the health-care law will eventually be successful.\n\ni believe it's going to be terminated, whether it be through the texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case. you would think it would have to be terminated, trump said in a recent interview with the new york times.\n\nbut a deal will be made for good health care in this country. that's one of the things i'll be doing, he added.\n\ndemocrats on the house energy and commerce committee quickly criticized the president's remarks, tweeting that trump openly admits the gop is looking to dismantle the law through the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nmeanwhile, four states have signed on to join 16 states and the district in an effort to defend the affordable care act. colorado, iowa, michigan and nevada filed a motion to intervene last thursday, arguing that they should be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit to protect their existing health-care infrastructure, which would be 'thrown into

andrew yang: sure. so none of you had heard of me eight, 10 months ago, i'd imagine. and i'm sitting here having outperformed half a dozen sitting senators, governors, members of congress. and so you have to ask yourself, how did that happen? and it happened because i'm laser-focused on the real problems that americans see around us every day, many of which led directly to donald trump being elected. right now, i'm fifth in the polls, rising, fastest-growing candidate or campaign in the race.\n\nso if we follow this through, i surprise in iowa, perform extraordinarily well in new hampshire, i become president of the united states in 2021, everyone would know that i won on the freedom dividend because that's my signature proposal. americans decided that $1,000 a month in cash is pretty great. and so then as president, i'm there celebrating with democrats and progressives because they're just thrilled we've beaten donald trump. they realized it was a bit of a bet, but it worked. and here we are.\n\nand then the republicans and conservatives in congress will look up and say, wait a minute, how do i feel about this dividend? a lot of people in my district seem very excited about it. the one state that's had a dividend for almost 40 years, alaska, is a deep-red conservative state and it was passed by a republican governor. this is a big win for rural areas that are struggling and red states on the interior that have gotten blasted by automation. and so we just need some of these republican congressmen to say, i am for the dividend because i'm for economic freedom. and if you get a majority, then you can pass it. now, can you get all of them? almost certainly not. but this is a law like any other. so you don't need a supermajority. you just need a congressional majority to pass the bill.\n\njonathan capehart: i mean, one could argue that when president [barack] obama came into office, he was laser-focused on getting health care to as many people as possible. and obamacare passed, but those republicans, no republican voted for it in the house. i'm having a hard time seeing how you're going to break the fever that president obama thought he was going to do in 2012 simply by your election. how are you going to convince the americans who are literally willing to die or or stay in dire economic circumstances simply because policies that you'd want to put into place and others want to put into place would benefit someone else?\n\nyang: i think that the attitude you are describing, while it does apply to a certain subset of americans, applies to a very, very low proportion of them. and i'm confident of this because when i campaign around the country, at every event i go to, someone comes up to me in the line afterwards and says, i voted for donald trump. this time i'm voting for you. one survey in new hampshire said that 10 percent of the voters who voted for trump would vote for me over trump in the general election. another survey said that 18 percent of college republicans would choose me over the president. now, this is not everyone. but this is enough. you don't need to convert 80 percent of the president's followers. you need to convert, let's call it 20 percent. so this attitude that you're describing is very real. but i believe that it does not contain 100 percent of the folks who voted for donald trump. and i know this because, again, they come to me at my events every single time and say, you're my candidate this time..\n\ni also believe i'm somewhat different from some of the other democrats in the field. and i can't speak to obama, but i've been on fox news any number of times. i'll talk to anyone. and one friend of mine, whose mother is an avid fox [news] viewer, said that yang is the only democrat i would support because he is the only one who does not seem to be judging me. that is enough for us to get a critical mass of donald trump supporters to get around a solution that would dramatically improve their way of life. they can see it.\n\nthe second argument i'd make is that cash is much, much harder to demonize than health care. if you go to a conservative in kentucky and say the government wants to take over your health care, you can get people very, very upset about that. if you say, hey, this cash is going to hurt you, it's going to be tougher. i mean, there might be some someone there who's like, yeah, the cash is going to hurt me, but others would be like, wait a minute, they do this in alaska. if i got that money, i think i'd be very productive with it. sure, some of my neighbors less so, but, you know, first things first. so we can get americans on board because it's such a simple, straightforward vision of citizenship.\n\nand i've run organizations for decades now. and what i say to people, is this. there are three ways you can treat human beings who work in your organization. no 1, you do nothing, then they leave you within a year. no. 2, you tell them how great they are. that lasts for about a year, and then they leave you before the second year. the third thing you can do is you invest in them. you compensate them. you give them raises, and you genuinely value them and then they'll stay with you forever. right now in the united states of america, we're doing some combination of one and two with our kids. we're saying, hey, things are great. you can vote. they don't really believe it. if you could look at every parent who could then look at their children and say, when you turn 18, you're going to get $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you, your country values you, and we are investing in you, that is a game changer for americans of every political party. and there are many people in red states who are already embracing this vision. i know, because i see them every day.
but once you subject this strategy to a moment's scrutiny, it becomes obvious that it will not bring about the result trump wants. indeed, the thinking here reflects a resolute refusal to appreciate an important reason the repeal effort melted down in the first place.\n\nad\n\nover the weekend, trump tweeted: obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. this reaffirmed what he'd said on friday, which is that the law will soon cease to exist — that democrats will own the fallout and will be desperate to deal. as many quickly pointed out, this suggested trump may go further than merely standing by as the law supposedly implodes, as he had previously contemplated doing, and may seek to actively harm the law. on fox news sunday, reince priebus declined to divulge the strategy.\n\ntrump administration officials and lawmakers of both parties blamed one another on march 26 following the failure of the gop health-care care bill. (bastien inzaurralde/the washington post)\n\nif trump wants, he can unleash serious damage by undermining the individual markets in three ways. insurers currently making decisions will closely scrutinize signs from the administration to gauge those markets' long-term viability. his administration can weaken the individual mandate through various mechanisms, which would mean fewer younger and healthier people and higher premiums. it can pull back on all forms of outreach designed to get people to enroll on the marketplaces. or it can stop paying cost-sharing reductions to insurance companies, which enable them to reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income enrollees, which may encourage insurers to flee the markets.\n\nad\n\nthis could strand many of the 12 million people who have gotten coverage on the individual markets, according to larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. they could be left with no insurers in the marketplaces, no way to get tax credits, no way to get coverage at all, levitt tells me, adding that the insurer exodus could also prevent people who individually obtain coverage outside the exchanges from doing so: you're talking about small business owners, farmers, self-employed people, early retirees — who would have no way of getting health insurance.\n\nad\n\nthis is all bad enough. but here's the real rub: there's no reason to believe such an outcome would actually force democrats to cooperate on health reform on the gop's terms.\n\none of the hidden morals of the great republican health care crackup of 2017 is that the american people flatly rejected replacing the aca with something substantially more regressive. the gop plan would have cut medicaid spending by $800 billion, leaving 14 million fewer people with medicaid coverage, while delivering an enormous tax cut to the rich. americans clearly disapproved of this outcome. a recent quinnipiac poll found that a majority opposed the gop plan, but more to the point, 74 percent of voters, including 54 percent of republicans, opposed cutting medicaid. the public broadly opposed the gop plan's most prominent mechanism for rolling back spending to cover poor people.\n\nad\n\nthe rejection of the gop plan is an important historical marker in our interminable health-care debate. the american people were presented with the first genuine effort at a gop consensus ideological alternative to obamacare — one that would do away with the aca's effort to guarantee free or affordable coverage through government spending and regulations — and decided they preferred sticking with the latter. the quinnipiac poll also found that 51 percent oppose repeal and 61 percent disapprove of trump's handling of the issue. as jonathan cohn puts it, the aca has shifted the expectations of what government should do ― and of what a decent society looks like. there are zero indications that trump and gop leaders are capable of acknowledging this possibility.\n\nad\n\nwhat's more, while house conservatives did kill the gop bill, it's important that many moderate republicans — senators, governors and even some in the house — opposed the plan precisely because it would take coverage from lower-income people. indeed, we've now learned that there may be a hidden majority in both houses of congress (democrats plus moderate republicans) behind leaving in place the type of spending and regulations (with the exception of the mandate) that broadly make up obamacare. the genuine moderate republican opposition to such cruelly regressive policy is a pleasant surprise.\n\nthus, the trump strategy — allow the aca to collapse, and profit — makes little sense. nothing further to the right than the gop plan can pass, because that would alienate still more moderate republicans. the only thing that could conceivably pass is something that would have democratic and moderate republican support, and thus would be more liberal than the gop plan. that should theoretically give democrats leverage to demand fixes to the aca on their terms — fixes designed to incentivize more enrollment to the markets and further expand medicaid in states that haven't opted in — even if trump is successful in sabotaging the individual markets.\n\nad\n\ntrump has persuaded himself that the public will blame democrats for tanking the markets, thus forcing them to the table. but that is fanciful, because republicans currently control everything. if this strategy produces anything, it's most likely to be a set of compromises that would give both democrats and republicans some concessions while preserving and perhaps growing the aca's coverage expansion — which would be broadly unacceptable to many ideological conservatives, and would require trump to cut them loose.\n\nad\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n* schumer says trump will have to ditch the right: on abc's this week, democratic leader chuck schumer laid down the conditions for democratic cooperation with trump on health care:\n\nif he changes, he could have a different presidency. but he's going to have to tell the freedom caucus and the hard right special wealthy interests who are dominating his presidency … he can't work with them and we'll certainly look at his proposals. but it's going to be guided on our values.\n\nas noted above, democrats will have leverage in this scenario.\n\nad\n\n* democrats see no need to compromise on tax reform: the new york times reports that democrats are newly emboldened by the gop defeat on health care, and see no need to compromise on further trump proposals, especially tax reform. chuck schumer:\n\nwe're not going to sacrifice our values for the sake of compromise. you think people from red states are going to be for tax reform with 98 percent of tax breaks going to the top 1 percent?\n\nin other words, democrats will proceed from the premise that, just as on health care, gop ideas on taxes will also be deeply unpopular, even among trump voters.\n\nad\n\n* top conservative says tax cuts don't have to be paid for: on abc's this week, rep. mark meadows, the head of the freedom caucus, which just helped kill the gop health plan, said he won't hold out for tax cuts to be paid for.\n\ni think there has been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset. and that's a move that we're trying to do to provide real relief and economic growth. when we start to grow the economy at 4, 4.1 percent, it actually not only increases wages, but it puts more money in americans' pockets each and every day.\n\nin other words, the gop tax reform plan — which will include massive tax cuts for the rich — will probably run up the deficit, and conservatives will be fine with that. shocking!\n\nad\n\n* there's no mandate for the gop agenda: nate silver looks at the health-care debacle and concludes that not only was the gop plan unpopular; but it's also clear that neither trump nor congressional republicans have any mandate:\n\ntrump was elected without much of a mandate, given his narrow margin in the electoral college and his loss in the popular vote. but congressional republicans didn't have much of a mandate, either. although people seemed to forget about it as they focused on trump's upset win at the top of the ticket, republicans lost seats in both the house and the senate in last year's elections.\n\nif ryan moves toward tax reform that deeply cuts taxes on the rich, we may see a rerun of the health debacle. the question is whether trump continues tethering himself to ryanism.\n\nad\n\n* how democrats should proceed now: e.j. dionne charts the path forward for democrats, now that it looks like the aca is here to stay for the foreseeable future:\n\ndemocrats can celebrate, but they cannot be complacent. they will have to expose and fight any efforts by the trump administration to sabotage the affordable care act through regulation. they should propose a package of improvements to make the aca work better and dare trump — and the dozen or so non-right-wing republicans who helped block the trump-ryan bill — to join them.\n\nit is not likely that any of those ideas will go anywhere, but doing this would demonstrate to voters that the law can be made to work better for them.\n\n* bring back the public option! paul krugman points out that if trump really wanted to fix obamacare, he could do so, by spending more money and taking other steps to remedy the fact that insurers have pulled out of the market in certain geographic areas:\n\none important answer would be to spend a bit more money. … better subsidies would help enrollments, which in turn would probably bring in more insurers. but just in case, why not revive the idea of a public option — insurance sold directly by the government, for those who choose it? at the very least, there ought to be public plans available in areas no private insurer wants to serve.\n\nand so, if trump really wants to cut deals with democrats, there are options out there.\n\n* trump was 'sullen' about defeat: cnn reports that trump's reaction to the big loss surprised some aides, who expected him to explode:\n\nhe did not vent or rage. instead in the oval office afterward trump was sullen and quiet as he contemplated his first blow, dealt by the washington swamp he had vowed to drain, one insider source said. the president was well aware he failed to deliver on an issue that stirs the passions of his political base. he was also mindful that the health care disaster would make his quest to tackle a behemoth tax package that much more difficult, the source said.
the report out of california — which, like a half-dozen other states, is allowing people special permission to sign up for affordable care act plans during the pandemic — underscores yet another economic ripple effect of the virus: it will spur large new health-care costs that many americans will eventually feel.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhile the vast majority of coronavirus patients will experience only mild symptoms, a subset of the infected will develop pneumonia or other respiratory trouble, requiring a hospital stay where they can have access to oxygen or a ventilator.\n\nactuaries for covered california, the state's aca marketplace, estimated that patients hospitalized because of coronavirus would stay an average of 12 days, generating an average bill of $72,000.\n\na majority of these patients will be over age 65, so the federal medicare program will pay their bills, which are typically around half or two-thirds of what commercial insurers pay. low-income people on medicaid will have coverage, too.\n\nad\n\nbut the outlook is troubling for other americans. if they are insured, they'll mostly be covered after meeting their annual deductible, but they'll still cause a boost in health-care spending that will make future premiums more expensive for everyone else.\n\nad\n\nand uninsured patients who require hospitalization will incur tens of thousands of dollars in costs.\n\ncovered california estimate calculated total costs to the system based on three scenarios. there's the scenario in which coronavirus has low impact, in which 400,000 people are hospitalized in the u.s.; medium impact where 1.2 million are hospitalized; and high impact where 3 million people are hospitalized.\n\nad\n\nin any of these scenarios, insurers will face large, unexpected bills that could prompt widespread premium spikes next year.\n\nit's a phenomenally large implication, lee told me.\n\ncalifornia's $72,000 estimate for a hospital stay for coronavirus is considerably larger than what other analysts have projected. kaiser family foundation researchers found the average employer-sponsored plan pays an average of $20,292 for hospital admission of a patient with pneumonia and major complications. the average cost ranged from $11,533 to $24,178, depending on the area of the country.\n\nad\n\nbut this much is clear: the coronavirus outbreak, which killed 100 people in the united state in a single day yesterday, will further strain a u.s. health-care system whose patients are already plagued by perpetually rising costs and inefficiencies all around.\n\nad\n\nthe washington examiner's philip klein:\n\ncnn reporter jeremy diamond:\n\nyet the pandemic has also offered obamacare advocates a chance to tout the law's successes on its 10th anniversary yesterday.\n\nwe couldn't need it more in terms of this pandemic, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said on a call yesterday hosted by the democrat-connected group protect our care. as we prayerfully go into this further discussion on the coronavirus challenge, thank god for the patient protection and affordable care act.\n\nadvocates were forced to dramatically scale back their plans to celebrate the aca's decade of existence on march 23. president obama released a video message instead of delivering an address at american university, which was canceled.\n\ncongressional democrats still seized the opportunity to tout the law's expansion of coverage to around 20 million americans through the individual marketplaces and medicaid expansion and its requirements for plans to cover essential services — including hospital visits and vaccinations, services that are particularly relevant during this pandemic.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthey resurrected their frequent pre-coronavirus messaging about the trump administration's constant bombardment of the law, most specifically its position that the entire measure is unconstitutional and should be struck down by the courts. pelosi asked the administration to reverse its position on the aca and to instead encourage the states still resisting medicaid expansion to accept it.\n\nchris lu, deputy secretary of labor under obama:\n\nlarry levitt, a senior vice president with the kaiser family foundation:\n\nand they called on the administration to further promote the law during the pandemic, by opening up healthcare.gov for a special enrollment period.\n\nad\n\nsign-ups are typically allowed only in the final two months of the year, but colorado, connecticut, maryland, massachusetts, nevada, new york, rhode island and washington (which all run their own marketplaces) have all temporarily reopened sign-ups. enrollment was already open in california and the district of columbia for other reasons, but both jurisdictions have said they'll keep it open longer.\n\nad\n\nrep. lauren underwood (d-ill.), who worked at the department of health and human services as the aca was being passed, said it's really important we leverage all existing authorities to ensure the american people have access to the care and coverage they need.\n\nwe just haven't seen any move toward that end from the administration, she said.\n\nad\n\nyou are reading the health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy. not a regular subscriber?\n\n\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: senate leaders and the trump administration appeared near a bipartisan deal last night on a massive stimulus package to bolster the economy with $2 trillion amid the coronavirus fallout.\n\nafter a day of partisan rancor and posturing on capitol hill, the outlook grew markedly more positive later in the afternoon, when offers and counteroffers were exchanged, our colleagues erica werner, paul kane, rachael bade and mike debonis report. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) convened democrats on a conference call and told them he was hopeful about striking a deal by the end of the day.\n\nad\n\nhours of negotiations halted just before midnight. schumer and treasury secretary steve mnuchin were optimistic a deal would be announced today. schumer told reporters mnuchin called the president, we told him we were very, very close to an agreement; he seemed very happy with that and wanted us to try to — get us to get it done tomorrow.\n\nad\n\ntrump tweeted this last night:\n\nif lawmakers and administration officials settle on a deal, they're hoping the package will move through the chambers quickly, although questions remained about how the house would address the legislation, since they're out of session and probably not likely to return all together to vote.\n\nwhat will be included in the legislation? it's set to include direct payments of $1,200 to many americans adults and $500 to children; roughly $850 billion in loan and assistance programs for businesses, states and cities; and spending increases for the unemployment insurance program, as well as hospitals and health-care providers reeling from the crisis.\n\nad\n\nour colleagues add: the fiery developments reflected rising tensions among lawmakers over the nation's predicament and what's happening in the senate itself; sen. rand paul (r-ky.) announced sunday that he has covid-19, and four other gop senators are quarantined. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) disclosed monday that her husband, too, is infected with the virus.\n\n\n\n— klobuchar said her husband, john bessler, got the test results yesterday.\n\ni just wanted to reiterate that one of the hardest things about this disease is he's in the hospital — he's been there a few days — and i can't even be by his side, klobuchar said on a previously scheduled conference call. i think many families in america are now experiencing this and things that are much, much worse.\n\nshe said the doctor advised her not to get tested — and noted she's been away from her husband for the past two weeks and is outside the 14-day period for getting sick.\n\nad\n\nas everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and i don't qualify to get one under any standard, she wrote in a post on medium.\n\n— paul, the first senator to announce he was diagnosed with the coronavirus, continued to work at the capitol for six days as the results of his test were pending, our colleagues seung min kim, michael scherer and paul kane report. he cast votes on the senate floor, met with other gop senators, played golf at a private club in northern virginia and worked out in a senators-only gym at the capitol hill complex.\n\npaul was defiant that he did nothing wrong, despite bipartisan criticism for his behavior and even sharper private furor among senators and aides because he had potentially exposed them to a virus whose debilitating effect on the nation's health and economy lawmakers were working so ferociously to combat, they add.\n\n— as the coronavirus continues to spread to members of congress and their loved ones, many are wondering why lawmakers aren't vote allowed to vote remotely.\n\nthe idea is gaining traction with a number of lawmakers. on monday, nearly 70 house democrats sent a letter to their leadership to push for remote voting, politico's sarah ferris reports.\n\non sunday, president trump said he'd support remote voting. top house democrats have privately floated it, our colleague amber phillips writes. in the senate, there's a new bipartisan proposal to vote remotely for up to 30 days. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) has endorsed the idea for an emergency.\n\nthe technology exists. we're just going to have to find a way to do it, klobuchar said monday. … i think at some point it's going to become inevitable.\n\n— the pandemic could now define the battle for congress, in more dramatic ways than the impeachment storm, which now feels far in the rear view.\n\ndemocratic campaign officials say the dual threats to public health and the economy have upended an election they worried — and republicans hoped — would focus on trump's impeachment, politico's sarah ferris and ally mutnick report. campaigning has all but ceased in the traditional sense: fundraising is down, and campaign officials on both sides say they're being more careful about when and how to attack their opponents.\n\nnow it's all about the coronavirus. rep. tom o'halleran (d-ariz.) said it's always about, 'what meeting are you going to on the virus?' or, 'what are you going to do on the virus bill?' \n\nrep. cheri bustos (d-ill.), who heads the house democratic campaign arm, said she's urging vulnerable members to follow federal health guidelines, which also means no public gatherings.\n\nnobody knows how long this is going to last, bustos told reporters. and here's the thing, it's not like coronavirus hits dems and not republicans.\n\noof: trump said he may soon loosen coronavirus containment guidelines for social distancing, despite dire warnings from public health experts, our post colleagues philip rucker, jeff stein, josh dawsey and ashley parker report.\n\namerica will again and soon be open for business — very soon, trump said at the daily white house news conference. we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\n\nthe consensus among experts — including infectious disease expert anthony s. fauci and other senior officials on trump's coronavirus task force — is that restaurants, bars, schools, offices and other gathering places should remain closed for many more weeks to mitigate the outbreak, the worst effects of which are yet to be felt in the united states, our colleagues write. but trump has been chafing against that notion and impatient to get american life back to normal.\n\nfauci and other experts have warned administration officials that a weakening of social distancing guidelines prematurely could mean overwhelmed hospitals and impeded efforts to curb the spread of illness.\n\nthe post's sarah kaplan:\n\n— in an editorial last week, the wall street journal's editorial board argued that federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.\n\nthe vast social-distancing project of the last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good. warnings about large gatherings of more than 10 people and limiting access to nursing homes will save lives, the board wrote.  … yet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don't mean federal spending. we mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn't true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.\n\ncoronavirus or covid-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. they're most likely to be similar to a regular cold, the flu or seasonal

campaigning in a virtual mode forces a team to translate the modern elements of a campaign into new forms. the biden team is going to have to learn as it goes, substituting virtual news conferences, virtual fundraisers, virtual roundtables and virtual volunteer events for physical, in-person affairs.\n\nthe good news for the biden team is that millions upon millions of people are at home — and for once may be eager to pick up the phone even for a number on caller-id that they do not recognize. they have time to watch biden's events on the computer and time to watch his appearances on sunday shows.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbiden's latest digital ad gives us a peek at what he will try to convey during an unprecedented time in a unique campaign environment:\n\nbiden seems ready to focus on four aspects of the covid-19 crisis.\n\nfirst, biden will not spare president trump from the charge that he failed as commander in chief, sending troops (health-care workers) into the fray without sufficient protection and equipment. the more trump protests that governors do not need ventilators or that there are plenty of tests, the more fodder he provides to biden that trump is a derelict, incompetent commander in chief.\n\nsecond, biden now can put meat on the bones of his message that the election is a fight for the soul of the nation. originally, this meant a battle to recapture america as a decent, fair and welcoming country. now, in the covid-19 pandemic, the battle is between two ways of addressing adversity. in biden's telling, republicans focus on bailing out corporate interests (e.g., the giant slush fund) and savaging regulations (even clear-air requirements in the middle of a respiratory illness) while democrats want to focus on more help for nurses and responders, more unemployment pay and more help for small business. (the senate majority leader is already dragging his feet on a fourth stimulus package). how the two sides react to the pandemic becomes emblematic of their values and priorities.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthird, the democrats' best argument in 2018 was health care. now that we are in a health-care epidemic not seen for 100 years, democrats have an obvious upper hand. unbelievably, republicans will not drop their lawsuit seeking to invalidate all of obamacare. in addition, on tuesday, politico reported, the trump administration has decided against reopening obamacare enrollment to uninsured americans during the coronavirus pandemic, defying calls from health insurers and democrats to create a special sign-up window amid the health crisis. this is horrifyingly cruel and politically shortsighted. republicans however seem determined to be on the side of taking away or denying health-care coverage to millions of americans. this is a gift to the biden team.\n\nfinally, biden plainly wants this to be about a contrast in leadership styles. in place of trump's bombast, irrationality and vindictiveness, biden presents a calm and empathetic figure. who do americans want to listen to for the next four years, and who do they trust to guide them through the recovery from america's worst domestic disaster in a century? on that, biden is betting the contest won't be close.\n\nthe better biden embraces personal vulnerability over electoral invincibility, says post columnist karen tumulty. (the washington post)
that theory might have had it backward.\n\nthe first month of pelosi's return to the speakership has thus far served as a pretty resounding affirmation of her leadership and political acumen. and wednesday epitomized it.\n\nat the start of the day, we got a cbs news poll that tested the popularity of washington's leaders. pelosi scored a 39 percent approval rating. that was shy of her disapproval — 50 percent — but it was significantly better than trump's split (36-59) and far better than senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's (r-ky.) 25-55. it also appears to be her best mark in a poll since the last time she was speaker a decade ago.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe poll also notably tested her head-to-head with trump, asking who was doing a better job with shutdown negotiations. forty-seven percent chose pelosi, while just 35 percent chose trump. it also affirmed previous polling that showed the american people blame trump and the republicans for the shutdown by more than a 20-point margin — the kind of margin that has forced republicans to fold during past shutdowns.\n\nand pelosi's edge in the shutdown fight was only reinforced as the day went on. early wednesday afternoon, trump made the highly questionable decision of telling pelosi he would deliver the state of the union address next week from the house chamber, even though pelosi has raised shutdown-related objections to it. but pelosi quickly sent a letter back saying she would not extend the invitation, and trump, rather remarkably, immediately backed down. pelosi had called his bluff.\n\nwe shouldn't extrapolate too much from the first three weeks of pelosi's speakership, but if anything it seems having a long-unpopular and volatile president as her own foil could play to pelosi's strengths. what people forget about pelosi, given her years featured in gop attack ads, is that she was relatively popular when she had this setup before. she first became speaker after the 2006 election and served in that role for the last two years of the george w. bush administration. her poll numbers only took a turn for the negative when barack obama and obamacare came along.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat doesn't mean her numbers will keep improving or that she won't still serve as a convenient lightning rod for republicans, and potentially help trump keep his base engaged for his reelection campaign. but this is a bit of a zero-sum game, and trump is dealing with something he has never dealt with before: a democrat with actual power who can stop him and reinforce his own weaknesses and miscues.
we should have done more to push back, both against his rhetoric and some of the things he did legislatively, one republican senator told the hill on the condition of anonymity.\n\nuh, yeah, say longtime republican critics of trump. what took so long, asks former republican national committee official douglas heye in a cnn op-ed, when all of this was so predictable? trump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nso how are these remorseful senators defending what some now say was the wrong move, to stand by trump for so long?\n\nhere's what they are saying about why they stuck by him for so long. we'll let you be the judge of what's a fair defense.\n\nhe's done good things as president: this is the most frequent defense we've heard. trump has been a means to many ends they wanted to reach: a conservative judicial branch, including a very conservative supreme court; tax reform; deregulation across the government; weakening obamacare.\n\ni think the judges he has nominated have been outstanding choices, sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) said thursday, when reporters asked him asked why he stuck by a president from whom he's now separating himself.  … i think what he did to destroy the caliphate was long overdue. it makes us safer. i think getting out of the iran nuclear agreement has led the way to peace between the arabs and the israelis at a level i would never have imagined. i think he's brought order to the border. he listened to me.\n\nhe's a vote-getter: the senate majority — and whether republicans could block democrats' governing majority — hung in the balance the same week that congress was going to confirm president-elect joe biden's win. the two republican senate candidates had gone all in on trump and his false election fraud claims. trump held a rally in georgia on monday, the eve of the election and two days before the riot at the capitol. sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.) joined him there, and announced that she'd be challenging trump's electoral college loss in her state despite there being no evidence or legal basis to do so.\n\nthe republican leadership explained repeatedly that we'd need trump to help get votes out, that anonymous gop senator told the hill about georgia.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nleft unsaid in this defense, of course, is that trump also helped remake the republican party in ways party leaders couldn't imagine, in ways that seemed fantastic at first. he was the first republican in 30 years to win wisconsin in the 2016 elections. he flipped michigan and the all-important pennsylvania. he helped boost turnout in 2020 down the ballot that stopped a blue wave in its tracks.\n\nholding their tongues on georgia didn't work. republican turnout in the runoffs dropped across the state compared to november, when trump was on the ballot, too.\n\nafter the mob forced senators and staff into hiding for hours wednesday, loeffler emerged with a change in attitude. she addressed her colleagues when the senate reconvened and said she can't in good conscience challenge the electoral college results. she was one of several gop senators who reversed their positions.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nrepublicans lost the other race that same day. under the trump era, the party has lost the house of representatives, the white house and the senate.\n\ndemocrats (and the media) bound them together: here's senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), who gave a speech urging his colleagues to confirm biden's win just an hour or so before rioters broke into the capitol: we just spent four years condemning democrats' shameful attempts on the validity of president trump's own election. … the media that is outraged today spent four years aiding and abetting democrats' attacks on our institutions after they lost.\n\nwhen trump won, some congressional democrats said they didn't think his election was legitimate because of russian interference. some objected to his electoral college win in 2016 (though no senators joined in, and not in nearly the numbers that republicans opposed biden's). many, if not most republicans, thought impeaching trump last year for his actions in ukraine was opportunistic and unnecessary.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndemocrats were unceasingly critical of the president — and so, on the whole, was coverage from mainstream media outlets, which covered his near-daily controversies and how he smashed through democratic norms.\n\nbut what republicans don't acknowledge in this defense is that much of trump's drama they themselves privately opposed.\n\nit took a deadly mob invading their place of work and their safety and the democratic process for some of them to say so publicly. and a few acknowledge that it's too little, too late.
the republican attempt to reshape the nation's health-care system has grown increasingly dependent this week on the fragile alliance between senate gop leaders and a man they have clashed bitterly with for years: sen. ted cruz (r-tex.).\n\nsenate leaders are struggling to build conservative support for their emerging bill, with gop aides and senators voicing growing skepticism that hard-right sens. rand paul (r-ky.) and mike lee (r-utah) can be persuaded to back it. conservative organizations, meanwhile, are complaining that majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is offering proposals that would not sufficiently dismantle the law known as obamacare.\n\nbut cruz, after building a national brand stoking tensions with mcconnell and his top deputies, is, in his own words, trying to get to yes. the former presidential hopeful has spoken positively about the negotiations, which he helped kick-start. his investment in the talks has generated cautious optimism among many republicans that he won't walk away from a delicate effort from which mcconnell, with a 52-seat majority and vice president pence as a potential tiebreaking vote, can afford only two defections.\n\ncruz's current role is one few would have predicted a couple of years ago for a man who once called mcconnell a liar on the senate floor and who, from his earliest days in the senate, set aside the chamber's customary politeness and built a foundation for his 2016 presidential bid centered on fighting the political establishment.\n\nbut the senator's colleagues need him as much as he needs them, so it's a role many are embracing — at least for the moment.\n\nsen. ted cruz's current role is one few would have predicted a just a couple of years ago. (carolyn kaster/ap)\n\ni've seen him come along and be pretty constructive, said sen. orrin g. hatch (r-utah), who has been a cruz critic.\n\nindeed, cruz sounds much more diplomatic these days. he said monday that a lot of work remains, but the talks in a working group that he started earlier this year with sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) have been productive.\n\ni've said from day one that i want to get to yes, cruz said. the consequences would be terrible to fail. yet cruz also promised not to pass a watered-down bill: even worse than not passing a bill is passing a bill that makes the problems worse.\n\nsome cruz associates said that opposing a repeal bill would be very difficult for him to defend with his political base as he gears up for reelection in 2018, and that he has come under pressure from donors to collaborate more with his gop colleagues. at the same time, some conservative activists are hoping that cruz can help move the bill to the right.\n\nfor cruz, the looming dilemma is the same one confronting many conservatives who, like him, rose to prominence during barack obama's presidency in part on the promise of ripping up the president's affordable care act: is it better to accept a final bill that falls short of the repeal they have long championed or walk away from it?\n\nthere's great pressure to get something done, but i think there's an equal and opposite pressure that it be something that actually fulfills campaign promises, house freedom caucus chairman and cruz confidant mark meadows (r-n.c.) said in an interview. just to check the box for political reasons, i don't think senator cruz would ultimately support that.\n\nthe dueling forces came into sharper focus tuesday afternoon, when cruz and other gop senators participated in a health-care meeting with president trump at the white house. at the capitol, mcconnell was expected to deliver more clarity and options to republican senators on the bill that is taking shape. leaders are racing to try to hold a vote as soon as this month, with some eying next month as a more realistic goal. meanwhile, the contours of the senate bill slowly are emerging. last week, mcconnell proposed a more gradual rollback of the expansion of medicaid than a bill that passed the house, as many gop senators have advocated. he also proposed maintaining some protections under obamacare for people with preexisting conditions, another departure from the house bill. that last possibility, however, worried some conservative groups.\n\nthe picture that was painted publicly is one of discussions that are moving further to the left, said dan holler, vice president of communications and government affairs at heritage action for america.\n\nthe mood of the negotiations is not very upbeat, said republicans familiar with the talks. mcconnell has presented ideas in closed sessions and has closely guarded the senate's plans in the hope that they will not leak to critics or the media. hatch struggled to project confidence about the process this week as he betrayed concerns. there's a difference between optimism about passage and optimism about getting it all put together the right way, hatch said, noting that senators have a lot to work through.\n\npaul has said he hopes he can make the bill more acceptable, even as others have predicted he will vote no. but he has also suggested a fallback plan of voting strictly on repeal. lee has not said publicly what he will do, though there is not a high level of confidence among capitol hill republicans that he will ultimately vote yes.\n\ndavid mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, recalled a conversation with cruz last week in which he said the texan's message was we're making progress; hang tight and you'll be happy with the final product.\n\nthose close to cruz say his willingness to negotiate with gop leaders is born in part out of political necessity. mica mosbacher, a fundraiser for cruz's presidential campaign, said cruz was at risk of losing support from benefactors who worried about his combative posture.\n\ndonors want team players who unite, not fracture our party, mosbacher said.\n\ncruz, unlike paul and lee, faces reelection in 2018 and is potentially vulnerable to attacks that he has spent his first term fighting with colleagues and running for president rather than delivering for his state. cruz has been a louder obamacare critic than most republicans, embracing a fight against the law that led to the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nfor those reasons, his allies see few benefits to opposing the senate repeal bill even if it's less than ideal. voting no would be complicated to convey to the conservative base he needs to turn for him, some say.\n\nyou have to be able to explain in a tweet, said a cruz associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe strategy.\n\none cruz adviser likened his approach to a baseball umpire with a big-strike-zone mentality right now, meaning he is giving his gop colleagues and their ideas the benefit of the doubt in the ongoing talks.\n\nin an interview this week, cruz said he was not remotely compelled to vote for just any gop health-care bill to protect his image.\n\nwe've got to solve the underlying problem, cruz said. in my view we must, number one, honor our commitment to repeal obamacare and, number two, implement reforms that lower premiums.\n\none potential stumbling block for cruz and other conservatives is the increasing possibility that gop leaders will not repeal all of the obamacare taxes. rank-and-file members have discussed keeping or delaying some of the taxes to help pay for such costly programs as banning insurers from charging more for patients with preexisting conditions and extending federal payments to states that accepted medicaid expansion under the aca, according to several gop aides familiar with the talks.\n\nseveral senators have suggested that the gop bill should keep at least some of the taxes, perhaps even including the widely panned tax on high-value employer plans known as the cadillac tax. the logic, according to aides, is that senators could delay the implementation of some taxes or promise to repeal others later, when they take up their next big agenda item: tax reform. but gop leaders do not have a clear path forward on that, and conservatives are anxious about leaving any of the aca taxes in place.\n\npart of mcconnell's strategy in trying to get to 50 votes is an effort to line up support from the many republicans who come from states where medicaid is expanded and want to see a softer blow against obamacare than cruz. the republican leader's proposal for a three-year wind-down of the expansion last week — many of them are pushing for seven — reflects this.\n\nthe question is whether he can pair such ideas with concessions to the right that would make the broader deal acceptable to enough senators. one possibility conservatives have identified is to use a different index to calculate how medicaid should be funded, which would mean deeper spending cuts to the program.\n\nother factors beyond cruz could scuttle the senate talks. opposition by sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) and susan collins (r-maine) to a measure that blocks funding to planned parenthood is among them.
oh, wait. that last one is actually what the senate bill would do.\n\nit really is hard, as 538's nate silver put it, to think of anything less populist than the republican health-care plan. you might be able to say the bank bailouts were, but even that's probably not true. as unfair as it was to give money to the people most responsible for the global financial crisis — and it was on a world-historical scale, especially when they were allowed to pay themselves that money in bonuses — it at least helped prevent what in all likelihood would have been an even bigger meltdown. the only thing worse than how much credit markets seized up before the $800 billion bailout is how much they would have if there hadn't been one. more people would have lost their jobs, loans would have become impossible to come by instead of just mostly so, and they would have stayed that way more than they already have, since it can take a while for new banks to replace the relationships and local knowledge that old ones had. that, at least, is what a professor named ben bernanke found was part of the reason the recovery from the great depression was as slow as it was.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe bailout, in other words, mostly helped wall street, but didn't exclusively help it. that's more than you can say for the gop's health-care plan.\n\nnow, there are three ways to think about the senate bill. the first is that it would take health-care from the poor and middle-class to pay for tax cuts for the rich at a time of already historic inequality. the second is that it would make insurance more expensive for everyone and less useful for anyone who is sick. and the third is that it would hurt president trump's working-class base the most. other than that, how were the tax cuts, mrs. lincoln?\n\nit's really pretty simple. the senate bill would, over the course of the next decade, cut obamacare's health insurance subsidies by $408 billion and medicaid by $772 billion all to pay for $700 billion of tax cuts, nearly half of which the nonpartisan tax policy center says would go to the top 1 percent of households. not only that, but the fact that it would only peg the value of its remaining subsidies to higher-deductible plans means that a lot of people would be pushed into them. they couldn't afford anything else. on an apples-to-apples basis, the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation estimates that the senate bill would increase the cost of a silver plan that covers 70 percent of expected medical costs by an average of 74 percent over the next three years — and more for the type of older, poorer people who overwhelmingly went for trump.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nalthough it's actually even worse than that. a 64-year-old making $26,500 would, according to the congressional budget office, see their premiums for a silver plan go from $1,700 under obamacare to $6,500 under the senate bill — but it'd be for a silver plan that covered 17 percent less of their expected medical expenses. so they'd be paying more to get less. how much more? well, the kaiser family foundation calculates that, in the case of our hypothetical 64-year-old, their deductible would go from $809 to $6,105. and it'd be an even bigger jump for people a little bit lower on the income ladder. someone making just $18,090 would see their deductibles increase from $255 to the same $6,105. the senate bill, then, would leave a lot of people with a choice between plans they couldn't afford to buy and couldn't afford to use.\n\nor, as the republicans would call it, freedom! and if you lived in a red state, you would probably get more of it. that's because the senate bill would let them opt out of essential health benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs — and in the process, the brookings institution's matthew fiedler points out, bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. the result would be a system where healthy people would mostly buy cheaper plans that didn't cover much, and mostly sick people would buy ones that did, you know, cover things — which would only make those more comprehensive plans so expensive that hardly anybody would be able to buy them at all. people would be forced to buy skimpy insurance that might not even insure you if you use too much of it.\n\nthis isn't a health-care plan that helps you if you need health care. not when it would give you higher premiums, higher deductibles and worse coverage. no, this is a health-care plan that only helps you if you're wealthy and have a lot of investment income. it would cut the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends from 23.8 to 20 percent for households making $250,000 or more. other than that, you're out of luck — and maybe out of being insured. indeed, the cbo estimates that the senate bill's $1.1 trillion of cuts to health insurance spending would result in 22 million fewer people having insurance in 10 years' time. all so that the top 2 percent of households, who are the only ones really getting ahead in today's economy, can have 2 percent more money after taxes.
what is the freedom caucus?\n\nad\n\nin january 2015, a group of conservative house republicans felt shut out of power and frustrated that gop leaders made legislative compromises with democrats and then-president barack obama. they founded the freedom caucus to help move their party further to the right.\n\nad\n\nthe group adopted a binding rule: 80 percent of its members could commit the entire caucus membership to vote together on a given proposal. within months, the group had roughly 40 members, enough to be pivotal on highly partisan votes.\n\nthe caucus soon became known for using hardball legislative tactics to achieve its goals. republican leaders who refused to make bills more conservative or to allow the caucus to offer floor amendments faced the likelihood that a coalition between the freedom caucus and house democrats would kill those bills or the procedural motions that brought them to the floor.\n\ndeveloping alliances is a key caucus strategy\n\nad\n\nin my new book about the freedom caucus, i identified 18 instances in which the organization tried to shape political or policy outcomes during its first two years. it succeeded (at least partially) 11 times, an impressive rate of success for a small group of lawmakers. but the caucus didn't only use threats to win; sometimes it developed partnerships with powerful individuals.\n\nad\n\nfor instance, one of its early goals was to eliminate the export-import bank, the federal government corporation that facilitates u.s. exports. it viewed the bank as wasteful corporate welfare. the group had too few members to block the bank's reauthorization on its own. so, the caucus worked with the chairman of the financial services committee, who refused to pass the reauthorization bill out of committee, and the bank's authorization expired. a cross-party coalition of lawmakers had to use a special house procedure to bypass the caucus and the committee and eventually reauthorize the bank.\n\ntrump's 2016 election offered the freedom caucus a chance to use the same strategy with the executive branch, because trump had few allies in the gop and little knowledge of how washington worked. although the caucus and the president at first clashed over the repeal of obama's affordable care act, caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) eventually developed close relations with the president, and the group became one of his biggest advocates.\n\nad\n\nthat relationship grew stronger when trump appointed rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), a caucus co-founder, as his budget director and then as his acting chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in the white house.\n\nad\n\nin late 2018, when it appeared that congress would wrap up its business without funding a southern border wall, meadows and other caucus members were able to leverage their white house ties and push for what became the longest federal government shutdown in american history.\n\nthe caucus is not all about power\n\nthe freedom caucus is not driven solely by a desire for more power. policy goals also matter. one caucus member told me that hardball tactics were necessary because we have some serious [policy] issues that face us, while another observed that the group's meetings were often productive because no one's questioning anyone's conservative credentials.\n\nad\n\ncaucus members also care about delivering what they think their constituents want. they often justify their tactics as ways to keep their campaign promises, as meadows did when he encouraged a possible shutdown in contrast with politicians who forget what they promised the american people. and caucus members have long believed that public conflict — like shutting down the federal government — is a strong negotiation tactic and a valuable way to show voters their commitment to policy.\n\nad\n\nthe desire to reflect the will of voters also helps explain why caucus members defend the white house. during the gop primaries, trump dominated his rivals in freedom caucus districts, including candidates backed by many caucus members. caucus members also feel pressure from their constituents to support the president's policy goals.\n\nwhat comes next?\n\nad\n\nstaying on good terms with the trump white house is not easy, given the president's mercurial approach to politics and relationships. if siding with trump pushes the caucus too far from its ideological principles, the group may have trouble recruiting and keeping members, or maintaining support from conservative activists.\n\nthe caucus's influence also has limits, especially because democrats control the house. the group and its allies are outnumbered in congress, whose cooperation the president needs to implement his agenda. for example, when the white house recently joined a legal challenge against the affordable care act — a decision traced to mulvaney — members of both congressional parties openly complained. trump promised a new health-care law to replace the aca, or obamacare, but retreated when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) told him the senate wouldn't pass one.\n\nad
president trump speaks as he meets with members of the coast guard, whom he invited to play golf, at trump international golf club on friday in west palm beach, fla. (evan vucci/ap)\n\nin his dec. 27 op-ed, my new year's wish for trump: respect the haters, too, gary abernathy demonstrated the vacuity of the reasons for the continued support of president trump. he wrote, i want trump to continue to 'drain the swamp,' enforce immigration laws, undo obamacare, cut costly regulation, put america first and even criticize journalists when their zeal to be the first to break unfavorable news about him results in inaccurate or poorly vetted stories. mr. abernathy expounded empty slogans, not material policies, slogans that ignite the amygdala of the human brain rather than stimulate the reasoning functions of the frontal lobe.\n\ni'm not a hater of mr. trump, and i accept that he is president of our nation, but i am considerably uneasy that he displays no skill at governing a great democracy. no amount of shallow arguments by his defenders can disguise this fundamental defect.\n\nfrank w. fletcher, reedville, va.\n\nafter reading gary abernathy's latest paean to the president, i am not sure which is worse: that he is the editor of a news publication or that he was invited to meet with graduate students at the columbia journalism school in new york.\n\nwhen i read about his full-throated support for the repeal of obamacare, i could only wonder what his local subscribers think, based on the following two facts: ohio is second in the nation in drug overdose deaths and, in 2017, ohio was one of the main beneficiaries of obamacare. as noted in a february cincinnati enquirer article: the decline in the rate of uninsured was staggering: in 2008, 36.1 percent of the poorest ohioans had no health insurance. as of 2015, the number was 14.1 percent — nearly a 61 percent drop.\n\nmalcolm wilson, silver spring\n\ngary abernathy closed his dec. 27 op-ed by expressing his wish that the president lead by example when it comes to respecting those who oppose him. it would be better if mr. abernathy wished for the leopard to change its spots.\n\ndon boselovic, vienna\n\nin his dec. 27 op-ed, urging president trump to respect the haters, gary abernathy utterly distorted the essence of the trump presidency. mr. trump, he says, should continue to drain the swamp, enforce immigration laws and criticize journalists but show respect. really? his apparent blindness to our president's chronic lying, justice obstruction, immorality, narcissistic impulsiveness, immigrant-bashing, press-attacking and acquiescence to authoritarian leaders places mr. abernathy among the alt-propagandists of the new alternate reality.\n\nralph ibson, washington\n\nit is ironic for gary abernathy to imply that everyone who doesn't like president trump should support him regardless, simply because he is the president, by suggesting that he personally didn't like president barack obama yet still supported him, whatever that means.\n\nmr. obama tried to be the president for everyone in the country, while mr. trump is concerned only with his base. mr. obama was attacked from day one by republicans, who refused to work with him in any legislative capacity and routinely stymied his efforts to repair the economy.\n\nmr. abernathy conveniently forgot that mr. trump launched his candidacy by relentlessly attacking mr. obama and questioning his legitimacy as president.\n\nrichard huntley, austin\n\nwith all due respect to gary abernathy, he is just plain wrong in his claim regarding donald trump's presidency. true, mr. trump won the electoral college vote, but he did not get the majority of votes. indeed, as mr. abernathy noted, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton got almost 66 million votes; mr. trump, ­63 million.\n\nwhen it comes to electing the president, the fact is that every vote does not count. this does not apply to any other elected position — the person who gets the most votes gets elected to office. the electoral college is an anachronism.\n\nsorry, mr. abernathy. despite having legally won the electoral college, mr. trump is not the true, morally legitimate president (and he knows it).\n\nbruce bernstein, rockville
tax loopholes. prescription drug pricing. financial rules. environmental protection. these companies define policies that are great for their bottom line, while good, honest people who work hard get squeezed harder every year. it's corruption, pure and simple.\n\nprogressive lawmakers such as warren (d) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of congress and the business interests who lobby them. last year, a study published in the american political science review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed congress's perception of what the american public wants.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe study, by alexander hertel-fernandez of columbia university and matto mildenberger and leah c. stokes of the university of california at santa barbara, found that congressional staffers were terrible at estimating constituents' support for various policies. on nearly every issue surveyed — from gun control to environmental regulation to obamacare — staffers in both parties believed the public was more conservative than they actually are.\n\nthe reason? congressional offices pay a lot of attention to what big business groups are saying — especially when those groups give them money.\n\nwell over half of gop staffers said that input from business groups was very or extremely important in shaping the policy advice they gave their bosses, the study found. over a quarter of democratic staffers said the same.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nstaffer contact with these organizations may skew their perceptions of the public because the groups are more ideologically conservative than the public along the range of issues we study, the researchers wrote.\n\nmany staffers admitted changing their minds about a policy topic after speaking with a lobbying group that had given money to their boss's campaign. 45% of staffers agreed they had developed a new perspective about a policy after speaking with a group that provided campaign contributions to their member, the authors write. this result suggests that a potentially large share of senior congressional staffers have had their thinking about policy shaped by interest groups that provided their member campaign contributions.\n\nand 62 percent of legislative staffers said they would view letters from employees of a hypothetical large company in their district as representative of public opinion, versus 32 percent who said the same about letters from ordinary constituents not identifying any business affiliation. perhaps most strikingly, 1 in 10 staffers told the researchers letters from ordinary citizens were not at all representative of public opinion in their districts.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ni think it's an outstanding paper, said brendan nyhan, a university of michigan political scientist who was not involved with the study. the article avoids simplistic accounts of money buying votes and instead provides evidence that representational biases may originate in part from information provided by contributors and/or communication from business groups.\n\nthat representational bias may partly explain why congress has often been willing to advance pro-business legislation even in the face of strong opposition from the public.
and like clinton did in 2016, they argued medicare-for-all isn't feasible in the united states.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) called it a pipe dream. both she and former vice president joe biden implied sanders wasn't being honest about how much it would cost.\n\nad\n\npolitico's carla marinucci:\n\nformer south bend, indiana mayor pete buttigieg said his own plan to expand coverage is better than running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion bills.\n\nad\n\nfrom larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation:\n\nsanders, biden, buttigieg and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) are in a four-person pileup in iowa, where polls suggest a variety of caucus outcomes are possible. sanders and warren are leading according to a selzer & co. poll, while a monmouth university poll has suggested biden and buttigieg will take the spoils.\n\nwe know this much: iowa's outcome will likely be complicated, considering each candidate will collect a percentage of delegates (versus winner-take-all) and voters' second choices come into play if their first-pick candidate doesn't generate enough support in a particular caucus location. iowa's outcomes can be critical: every single winner of the iowa democratic caucus since 2000 has gone on to be the party's nominee for the general election (that's not true for republicans).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nand iowa voters care a lot about health care. forty-five percent of iowa caucus-goers say it is their no. 1 concern, according to the monmouth poll released this week. that's down from 56 percent in august but still ranks above any other single issue – including beating president trump and climate change.\n\nthere's been a lot of focus on how the 2020 candidates are picking sides between medicare-for-all and the public option approach. many of them have moved towards a more moderate position, a shift that was most evident last night in warren, who spoke enthusiastically about shoring up obamacare and barely mentioned medicare-for-all.\n\nwashington examiner's kimberly leonard:\n\nthe hill's jessie hellmann:\n\nbut their tangles are an extension of the fight sanders and clinton were having in 2016. at the time, clinton suggested medicare-for-all could never happen.\n\npeople who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass, she said a few days before the 2016 iowa caucuses.\n\nat an nbc debate on jan. 17, 2016, clinton accused sanders of withholding details about medicare-for-all.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwhen we are talking about healthcare, the details really matter and therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work, clinton said. he didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either and tonight he's come out with a new plan and again we need to get into the details.\n\nsanders is hoping for a better fate four years later. now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide health care to all through a medicare-for-all single-payer program, sanders said at last night's debate.\n\nthe question is whether democratic voters have shifted enough for a medicare-for-all candidate to win. the other candidates argue that voters – and most democratic leaders – haven't.\n\ni was in vegas the other day and someone said 'don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.' that's the problem, klobuchar said, noting that majorities of house and senate democrats and numerous democratic governors don't support the approach.\n\nmore health highlight from the debate:\n\nad\n\nad\n\n— there was nary a mention of president trump's claims a day earlier that he championed protections for patients with preexisting conditions (read our health 202 fact-check here). the candidates mostly stuck to their own differences over expanding health coverage, which one could argue makes for a better debate but disappointed democratic activists who are primarily concerned with beating trump.\n\n— the trump campaign responded to the debate with a statement saying all the candidates showed they'll ruin health care.\n\nbased on their performances on stage, the six democrat candidates demonstrated that not one of them deserves to win the iowa caucuses in less than three weeks, tim murtaugh, trump 2020 communications director, said in a statement. they will tank the economy, ruin health care, raise taxes, and fail to adequately defend the united states. president trump would dominate any of them in november.\n\n— prescription drug prices got some air time.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwarren said she'll use executive powers on her first day in office to help lower the cost of key drugs, like insulin, epipens and treatment for hiv/aids. she also called for increasing generic drug competition and said the pharmaceutical industry blocks access to them.\n\nthere are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. they're generic drugs. but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up, warren said. so my view is, let's give them a little competition... this is a way to make markets work.\n\nklobuchar said she is open to looking at warren's plan for generic manufacturing but touted her own proposals, like allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices and importing cheaper drugs from foreign countries.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nshe pointed to her bill with sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) on drug importation as well as her bill to stop generic drugmakers from taking

jane schacter: the ruling is notable for its narrowness. the court was invited to issue a broad ruling shielding merchants who have religious objections to same-sex weddings — protecting them from delivering goods and services that religious liberty proponents claimed would be compelled speech in favor of same-sex marriage. there was a fierce argument about whether baking a cake is speech. had the court said it was, the key question would have been which other goods and services would count as compelled speech. what about flowers? linens? wedding venues?\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut the court ducked that question. instead, it made three critical choices.\n\nfirst, it framed the decision in terms of free exercise of religion, not freedom of speech.\n\nsecond, it emphasized how the colorado anti-discrimination commission disparaged religion in handling this issue. here the court focused on derisive comments made about [masterpiece owner jack] phillips's beliefs by state officials and the fact that the state gave other bakers leeway to refuse to bake cakes based on what might be seen as nonreligious claims of conscience. the majority said that doing so violated the principle that neutral laws — in this case, anti-discrimination laws — cannot be applied with animus toward religion.\n\nad\n\nthird, in several passages the majority resisted any broad exemption for religiously motivated merchants who object to serving same-sex couples, whether on free-speech grounds or on other constitutional grounds. justice kennedy said, for example, that society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity or worth — and that the exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight by the courts.\n\nad\n\nand he said categorically that while religious and philosophical objections are protected … such objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and service under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law. this sends a pretty strong signal that kennedy, at least, would resist broad religious-liberty claims that shielded merchants from anti-discrimination laws.\n\njohn sides: the aclu's david cole, who represented the plaintiffs, wrote here at the washington post that while his clients lost the battle, they won the war. would you agree?\n\nad\n\njane schacter: that depends on who will be deciding cases in the future.\n\njustice kennedy has had outsize importance on lgbt rights, writing majority opinions in all the signal decisions issued by the court in the last two decades. and now he has written masterpiece, which in part protects those decisions. what will happen if he leaves the court?\n\nad\n\nmasterpiece's concurrences suggest that justices thomas, alito and gorsuch would like to apply a broader idea of religious liberty. the chief justice did not join those opinions. the opinions written or joined by justices ginsburg, breyer, sotomayor and kagan resisted broad claims that religious liberty could override anti-discrimination laws.\n\nad\n\nso even if kennedy was replaced with someone more like gorsuch, we do not know if there would be five votes for a broader religious-liberty claim than the limited one accepted in masterpiece.\n\njohn sides: is this decision related to hobby lobby's protection of religious freedom at all?\n\njane schacter: both cases pit religious liberty against equality claims. in hobby lobby, the business argued that for religious reasons it objected to the obamacare mandate to offer insurance that covered contraception — something many women argue is essential to gender equality. but that case was decided not under the first amendment but the federal religious freedom restoration act, or rfra. that act grants stronger protection to religious liberty than does the first amendment's free-exercise clause. but because of an earlier precedent, the supreme court uses first amendment as a standard in cases like masterpiece involving the states.\n\nad\n\nad\n\njohn sides: what is the state of the ongoing legislative skirmishing between religious-freedom acts and anti-discrimination laws?\n\njane schacter: twenty-one states currently have their own version of rfra, and more continue to be introduced. the most expansive of these laws will surely face constitutional challenges. mississippi's law is probably the most extreme in permitting, among other things, businesses to deny service to lgbt customers and has been challenged as violating lgbt individuals' constitutional rights. the supreme court recently decided not to hear a challenge to that law, but it was a procedural question only. expect further litigation.\n\njohn sides: it sounds as if this case didn't exactly end the debate between religious liberty and anti-discrimination principles.\n\nad\n\njane schacter: you're right. the conflict will almost certainly continue. the narrowness of the stated grounds in masterpiece will invite continued litigation.
trump's pronouncements on a range of health-care topics — such as preexisting condition protections, the effects of medicare-for-all and the state of the affordable care act — are among the more than 16,200 false or misleading claims he has made in his three years since taking the oath of office.\n\nad\n\nthat's the tally from the post's stellar fact-checking team, which in the administration's first 100 days started a database for analyzing, categorizing and tracking every suspect statement trump utters. at the request of readers, they kept it going.\n\nad\n\nnow the database shows trump made 8,155 suspect claims in 2019, up from 5,689 claims in 2018 and 1,999 claims in the first year of his presidency.\n\nin a single year, the president said more than the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years, our colleagues glenn kessler, salvador rizzo and meg kelly write. put another way: he averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019.\n\nad\n\nhere are trump's top five misleading health-care claims, in order of how frequently he has repeated them:\n\n1. trump is particularly fond of making bold claims about how the veterans affairs mission act came about and what it did. he has claimed the legislation was all his idea. he has suggested congress couldn't get the measure approved for 44, 45 or even 48 years. he has made these claims — or iterations of them —113 times, according to the post database.\n\nad\n\nfor example, trump said this at his reelection kickoff last june:\n\nwe passed va choice so they can see their doctor. our veterans were waiting online for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks. ... we passed va choice. you go out now, you get a doctor. you fix yourself up. the doctor sends us the bill. we pay for it. ... va choice for the veteran? they've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years.\n\nad\n\nthe actual history of the va choice program goes like this: congress passed the program under obama as a way of addressing the 2014 scandal in which veterans affairs facilities were found to be obscuring long wait times for medical appointments. the program allowed one-third of veterans to get government-paid health care in private settings.\n\nbut because choice was heavily criticized as being too unwieldy and bureaucratic, congress tried to reform it by passing the mission act in 2018 under trump. the mission act loosens the restrictions around when a vet may seek private medical care, allowing it if they live more than 30 minutes from a va clinic or face wait times of more than 20 days for most health-care appointments.\n\nad\n\nso trump is incorrect when he says congress passed choice under his watch — that credit goes to obama.\n\nad\n\nand as to his claims about how long veterans were waiting for care previously, the government accountability office found in april 2018 that the va cannot systematically monitor the timeliness of veterans' access to choice program care because it lacks complete, reliable data to do so.\n\n2. trump has made all sorts of dubious claims about the 2010 affordable care act, calling it crazy, a disaster and not working. he has made such claims 80 times.\n\neven if one factors in all the struggles the health-care law has faced, these are rather extreme statements. the aca cut the uninsured rate by about half (although lately the uninsured rate has been creeping back up) by providing subsidized coverage to millions of americans. it ensured more comprehensive coverage to those with employer-sponsored plans. it allowed states to expand medicaid.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit's true the aca marketplaces had a rough website rollout in 2013 and struggled in subsequent years to attract enough insurers to offer affordable coverage. but things have been looking better lately. the congressional budget office has said the individual market would be largely stable for the next 10 years, mostly because a majority of the enrollees are eligible for subsidies and are thereby sheltered from premium hikes.\n\nthere's a reason, after all, why republicans couldn't manage to repeal the law in 2017, despite controlling both the house and the senate — the law benefited too many voters by that point.\n\n3. the president has another favorite overstatement related to veterans' health care: that a june 2017 measure he signed allowed underperforming va workers to be fired for the first time ever.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nglenn — who awarded trump three pinocchios for this claim he's made 73 times — writes that this assertion is simply wrong.\n\nhundreds of va workers were fired every month, even before trump signed the bipartisan veterans affairs accountability and whistleblower protection act. and in 2014, congress passed a law aiming to make it easier to remove senior officials because of poor performance or misconduct.\n\naccording to the post's review of federal data, 2,619 va employees were fired in the 12 months before the law, compared with 3,473 in the 12 months after the law.\n\ntrump ignores the fact that hundreds of va employees every month already were being fired before the law was passed; in fact, he falsely suggests that firings were not possible before, even if employees 'stole or were sadists,'  glenn writes.\n\n4. trump's claims around patients with preexisting health conditions (including one that glenn gave four pinocchios) have attracted the most ire from democrats. that's because it was they who first passed such protections within obamacare — the law trump tried initially to repeal and subsequently modified through regulatory action.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump has misled the public about his approach to patients with preexisting conditions a total of 73 times, our fact checker says. he frequently alleges that republicans — not democrats — are the longtime champions of such protections.\n\nas we've documented extensively in the health 202 (check out our recent history of preexisting condition protections), trump's administration has taken repeated steps to undermine the aca's ban on insurers from refusing coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or charging them more.\n\nin 2018, the administration announced it wouldn't defend the aca in a legal challenge from gop-led states. at the time, the justice department filed a brief saying the law's preexisting condition protections can't exist without the law's penalty for lacking coverage (which congress had repealed).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe following year, the administration took an even deeper stance against the aca, saying it believes the entire law must be toppled now that the penalty for lacking coverage is gone.\n\nand there's more evidence that trump hasn't prioritized protecting patients with preexisting conditions. back when congressional republicans tried to replace obamacare in 2017, they came up with plans that would have weakened those protections — which the president supported.\n\n5. this attack — that democrats want to eviscerate the medicare program — was popular among republicans in the 2018 election as they tried to turn the health-care issue to their advantage. trump has repeated such claims 56 times.\n\nif trump were merely arguing that many democratic candidates are seeking big changes to medicare, he'd be right. but in contrast to his claims — which make it sound as though democrats are trying to cut benefits — the idea under medicare-for-all is to dramatically expand the program and its benefits to all americans.\n\nad\n\nthere are plenty of fair critiques of medicare-for-all, as envisioned by sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.), elizabeth warren (d-mass.), rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) and other liberal democrats. it would massively inflate federal spending and could prompt provider shortages if the payment rates were set too low.\n\nbut it's also not fair for trump and republicans to characterize democrats as trying to eliminate medicare, when what they want to do is make the popular program accessible to everyone.\n\nyou are reading the health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy. not a regular subscriber?\n\n\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: the trump administration is expected to issue guidance on allowing states to convert medicaid funding into block grants as soon as this month. the move would follow the office of management and budget's signal in november that the initiative had been dropped or delayed, the wall street journal's stephanie armour reports.\n\napproving state waivers to change medicaid funding to block grants would be among the administration's most controversial moves to reshape medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health coverage to one in five low-income americans. medicaid is the main source of long-term care coverage for americans and is a guaranteed benefit, or entitlement, for eligible individuals, she writes.\n\nlawmakers in tennessee, alaska and oklahoma have already expressed an interest in pursuing block grants. supporters of block grants say the change would free states from federal requirements and give them more flexibility to try new ways to increase coverage and cut costs.\n\noof: president trump chided hhs secretary alex azar in a campaign meeting for failing to do more to address health care and drug pricing concerns. the confrontation happened after the president was briefed on polling from battleground states showing the public trusts democrats more than republicans on the issue, our colleagues josh dawsey and yasmeen abutaleb report.\n\ntrump reacted furiously and said the democrats would 'kill us' on health care, according to the four people, who requested anonymity to candidly describe the private meeting. the president then picked up the phone, called azar and put him on speakerphone in the middle of the meeting, josh and yasmeen write.\n\ntrump told azar he's not getting it done, and that he needs to hurry up to lower drug prices and to allow for cheaper drugs to be imported from canada.\n\ntrump also asked azar for an update on hhs's work on lowering drug pricing, and the two discussed the fact that drug importation was popular with the public, josh and yasmeen write. they also shared frustration about the number of health-care regulations that had been stopped by the courts — including a rule that would require drugmakers to post the list prices of their medications in television ads and state requirements that medicaid recipients work to maintain their coverage — and by the lack of media coverage of the administration's health-care and drug pricing policies.\n\nazar told trump he was doing everything he could but that much of his work was being stopped or hampered, they add.\n\nhhs spokeswoman caitlin oakley responded this way: we do not comment on conversations or meetings between secretary azar and the president. the trump administration has done more than any other administration in history to lower the high cost of prescription drugs and we fully anticipate this momentum will continue.\n\nouch: the national archives admitted it made numerous changes to a photo of the 2017 women's march showcased at the national archives exhibit celebrating the centennial of women's suffrage.\n\nat least four of the photos were found to be altered, our post colleague joe heim reports. a placard that proclaims god hates trump has trump blotted out so that it reads god hates. a sign that reads trump & gop — hands off women has the word trump blurred out.\n\nwords on signs that referenced women's anatomy were also blurred. one sign blurred the word vagina from a sign that originally read, if my vagina could shoot bullets, it'd be less regulated. another sign that read this pussy grabs back has the word pussy erased.\n\narchives spokeswoman miriam kleiman said the changes were made because the museum hosts young people and the messages could be deemed inappropriate and because, as non-partisan federal agency, the archives was trying to stay away from political controversy.\n\nbut prominent historians expressed dismay when told about the action taken by the archives,\n\nthere's no reason for the national archives to ever digitally alter a historic photograph, rice university historian douglas brinkley said. if they don't want to use a specific image, then don't use it. but to confuse the public is reprehensible. the head of the archives has to very quickly fix this damage. a lot of history is messy, and there's zero reason why the archives can't be upfront about a photo from a women's march.\n\nindustry rx\n\n— the american college of physicians, the second-largest physician

even if the new policy did not work in their favor, lenny writes. those patients and hospitals, in places such as georgia, kentucky, kansas and virginia, have said they would face the prospect of fewer available organs under the new rules, as more livers are taken by transplant centers in cities with greater demand and higher insurance payments.\n\n— federal health officials announced they

the law says such plans sponsored by a nonprofit agricultural organization . . . shall be deemed not to be insurance. that means they will be allowed to avoid both federal and state insurance regulations.\n\nad\n\nwithin iowa, this new curve around the aca has sparked debate over whether the strategy is a creative path to offer some residents an alternative to spiking prices in the insurance marketplace the state created under the federal law — or a path to substandard coverage that will divide the healthy from the sick.\n\nad\n\nmore broadly, the strategy is among the ripple effects across the country from congress and the trump administration having decreed that americans who flout the law's individual insurance mandate will no longer be charged penalties. when enforcement of the mandate ends next year, consumers will not risk a fine for being uninsured or having health coverage that lacks some of the aca's required benefits and consumer protections.\n\ndespite congressional republicans' failure last year to repeal much of the sprawling 2010 health-care law, the recent moves by both the federal government and gop states are nevertheless chipping away at a central goal of the democrats who created it: fostering comprehensive coverage nationwide for people without access to affordable health benefits through a job, while prohibiting insurance industry practices that often had put health plans out of reach for individuals with prior or current medical problems.\n\nad\n\nif the aca's insurance rules can't be repealed, then an alternative is to get people the option of escaping them, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. without the penalty, the door is wide open for plans like this.\n\nad\n\niowa lawmakers approved the farm bureau plan last month as federal agencies are taking steps to carry out a directive by president trump to make it easier for americans to buy coverage that skirts those requirements.\n\nin january, the labor department proposed new rules that would widen access to association health plans — originally intended for small businesses that band together — by enabling individual consumers to buy them and reclassifying them so that such plans do not have to include such benefits as maternity care and mental health services. the iowa measure also allows the sale of association health plans that follow the new federal rules.\n\nad\n\nthen in february, the department of health and human services proposed to broaden americans' ability to rely on short-term health plans that similarly circumvent the aca's required benefits and protections. such plans could be sold for up to a year, rather than the current three months, and federal officials have said they would like them to be renewable from year to year.\n\nad\n\nmeanwhile, idaho is attempting a different route around the aca rules. gov. c.l. butch otter in january issued an executive order to allow insurers to sell health plans missing some of the federal requirements as long as the companies also sell at least one plan inside idaho's aca marketplace. the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) recently told idaho officials that the approach appears likely to be illegal, but it has been holding meetings and conference calls to try to work out a solution.\n\nfor iowa, the farm bureau plan is the state's second attempt to bypass parts of the aca. last year, the state's insurance commissioner asked federal health officials to allow iowa to take about $350 million in aca money for 2018 and use it in different ways to help people pay for plans outside the marketplace. state officials said at first that the trump administration seemed receptive. but when the government had not given approval as last fall's aca enrollment season neared, iowa withdrew the proposal.\n\nad\n\nthe hawkeye state's latest strategy has a back-to-the-future quality. starting in 1969, the nonprofit iowa farm bureau sold wellmark blue cross and blue shield policies to its members. the arrangement ended when the aca came along, because those health plans did not meet the federal law's rules and would have exposed consumers to penalties.\n\nad\n\nwellmark, the state's largest health insurer, had sold aca plans but announced last spring that it would pull out of that marketplace in 2018. aetna also withdrew, and the only marketplace insurer remaining, medica, raised its prices by an average of 57 percent.\n\niowa insurance commissioner doug ommen said that he is officially undecided about the new farm bureau law but that he sympathizes with the need for more-affordable coverage. as consumers have been hammered by the aca rates, he said, enrollment in iowa's marketplace has tumbled from nearly 75,000 in 2016 to about 61,000 last fall to 46,000 last month.\n\nad\n\nthe dropouts are primarily people with incomes too high to qualify for aca subsidies. that is the group iowa officials expect to be attracted to the new coverage, which is why ommen predicts it will not undercut the marketplace.\n\nad\n\nkaiser's levitt said defining some wellmark health plans as not insurance is weird. the unregulated plans, he said, could prompt questions about their financial solvency or whether dissatisfied customers have appeal rights.\n\naccording to ommen, the farm bureau modeled its idea after a similar arrangement sponsored by the tennessee farm bureau, which began decades ago and has continued in the aca era. the obama administration never challenged it.\n\nad\n\ncms did not respond to a request for its view on iowa's new law.\n\niowa farm bureau spokeswoman laurie johns said that about 15,000 members contacted their state legislators to support the bill. the new plans could be on sale through bureau agents in every county as early as the fall, for current members or anyone who pays a $55 annual fee to join, she said.\n\nad\n\nin a bill-signing ceremony at the state capitol in des moines, the governor contended that iowa's individual insurance market had ample choices and reasonable premiums before the aca left it in collapse. after urging congress to fix this problem, reynolds recounted monday, she decided we are done waiting and urged state lawmakers to find their own solution. that is exactly what they did.\n\nad\n\nrose danaher, a beef farmer and one of two consumers the governor invited to speak at the ceremony, said the law opens the door for the iowa farm bureau to restore health benefits and peace of mind.\n\nafter her aca insurer left the state, she couldn't afford the only plan that remained, danaher said. there is no reason a healthy 32-year-old should be paying more for health insurance than for her mortgage.\n\nad
kaine and bennet have tweaked their bill to more closely reflect what biden proposed during his campaign.\n\nthe legislation, which the duo first introduced back in october 2017, now includes an expansion of marketplace tax subsidies to ensure people don't pay more than 8.5 percent of their income on monthly premiums. it would also eliminate a subsidy cap for people earning 400 percent of the federal poverty level or more.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis idea — aimed at addressing persistent affordability concerns among middle-income earners — was a mainstay of biden's health-care plan during the campaign. it's also included in the coronavirus relief package congress is working to pass.\n\nthe central tenet of medicare-x also closely aligns with biden's vision.\n\nthat's to create a public option plan to be sold on the marketplaces alongside private coverage. all three men — kaine, bennet and biden — are in the camp of moderate democrats who want to fill in coverage gaps with incremental reforms rather than a sweeping medicare-for-all overhaul.\n\nto that end, medicare-x proposes adding a public option plan first in the parts of the country where consumers have the fewest private marketplace options, then moving to areas with higher plan costs and finally expanding into every zip code in the country by 2025. the aim is to give consumers more options, while also putting competitive pressure on private plans to lower their costs.\n\nin our view, this bill helps finish the work of obamacare. it gives the american people a choice, bennet said.\n\nfor the first time, it's possible to envision a pathway for passing at least parts of medicare-x.\n\nuntil this year the bill wasn't destined to go anywhere, with president donald trump in office and republicans controlling the senate. it will still be hard for democrats to pass partisan legislation this congress, with only 50 democratic senators and vice president harris serving as the tiebreaker.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nso democrats may rely on multiple budget reconciliation bills to get partisan priorities passed. this type of legislation — requiring just a simple senate majority instead of the usual 60 votes — is the same way republicans tried to repeal obamacare back in 2017.\n\nkaine and bennet want medicare-x to hitch a ride on a reconciliation bill. congress can only pass one of these bills a year and is using last year's vehicle to do coronavirus relief. two more budget reconciliation bills will be available during the current congress — and kaine and bennet say they've revamped medicare-x with an eye toward them.\n\nthere's another potential hiccup. it's not entirely clear whether all the elements of medicare-x could go into a budget reconciliation bill, which can only include provisions directly related to federal spending.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut kaine and bennet said they're hopeful elements might make it into the next reconciliation package, which the biden administration wants to use for economic recovery after the pandemic.\n\nit's gotta be an equitable economy, and there is nothing that would make our economy more equitable than having broader availability of health coverage, kaine said.\n\nmedicare-x leaves out one biden proposal: lowering the medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60.\n\nthe president backed that idea later on in his campaign, as yet another way of giving more americans access to affordable coverage. affordability of health insurance is an ongoing concern for many americans — not only for those already covered but also for the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured, despite the sweeping 2010 health-care law.\n\nad\n\nseveral other democratic members of congress have proposed legislation along these lines. sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.) has proposed lowering the eligibility age to 50. the choose medicare act from sens. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), jeff merkley (d-ore.) and chris murphy (d-conn.) would let any american buy into medicare, including employers who could purchase medicare plans for their employees.\n\nad\n\nbut kaine and bennet did add in some new elements aimed at lowering coverage costs. medicare-x would:\n\nallow medicare to pay 50 percent more to rural hospitals and providers, up from a 25 percent allowance.\n\nrequire marketplace plans to fully cover primary care services with no cost-sharing for patients.\n\nfix the so-called family glitch in the affordable care act, which bases a family's eligibility for marketplace subsidies on whether an employee's offer of workplace coverage was affordable for the individual but not necessarily affordable for the whole family.\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: biden has picked chiquita brooks-lasure to lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services.\n\nthe administration hasn't announced the selection, but four people confirmed to dan diamond and amy goldstein that brooks-lasure is the pick to lead the $1 trillion agency that oversees medicare, medicaid and large parts of the aca.\n\nad\n\nbrooks-lasure served in the obama administration as a senior cms official who helped implement the affordable care act's coverage expansion and insurance-market reforms, dan and amy report. she also worked on capitol hill as a democratic staff member for the house ways and means committee, building ties with then-rep. xavier becerra, biden's choice to lead the health and human services department and who sat on the committee at the time.\n\nthe role is considered the second-most-powerful position within the department of health and human services after the hhs secretary.\n\nduring the presidential transition, brooks-lasure served as a lead for biden's hhs review team, helping assess the trump administration's operations, dan and amy write. she has most recently served as a managing director at manatt health, a consulting firm that works with the health-care industry — a role that raised some concerns inside the biden administration given the president's stringent ethics pledge and the potential for brooks-lasure to shape policies that might affect her former clients, said one person familiar with those concerns.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut brooks-lasure was championed by allies on capitol hill, including the congressional black caucus. as we wrote a few weeks ago, mandy cohen, the north carolina health secretary and a fellow obama veteran, was also considered for the role.\n\noof: biden and fauci are butting heads over teacher vaccinations.\n\nthe tension is over whether teachers should be required to return to classrooms before getting the coronavirus vaccine. some teachers unions – who were a major contributor to biden's campaign – are insisting they shouldn't have to return to in-person learning until all teachers have been vaccinated. yet upon becoming president, biden made reopening schools a major goal – one that he has since appeared to back away from.\n\nad\n\ndr. anthony s. fauci said wednesday that vaccinating all teachers against covid-19 before reopening schools is 'non-workable,' wading into an issue that has taken center stage for the biden administration amid the ongoing pandemic, politico's ben leonard reports.\n\nif you are going to say that every single teacher needs to be vaccinated before you get back to school, i believe quite frankly that's a 'non-workable situation,' fauci told cbs this morning.\n\nbut top administration officials have strained to avoid subscribing to the centers for disease control and prevention's position that schools can reopen without teachers being vaccinated, our colleague aaron blake reports.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe white house has repeatedly avoided endorsing the position of the health officials whose scientific guidance biden assured the nation would be the north star of his administration's coronavirus response, he adds.\n\nouch: a third of military service members are refusing the coronavirus vaccine, according to defense officials.\n\nnearly 150,000 service members are fully vaccinated, a panel of defense officials told lawmakers in a house armed services committee hearing on the pentagon's coronavirus response. about two-thirds of troops who were offered the vaccine accepted it, the post's alex horton reports.\n\nthe acceptance rate mirrors preliminary data that we see in other communities of americans, air force brig. gen. paul friedrichs, a joint chiefs of staff health official, told lawmakers.\n\nthe military mandates that service members receive a variety of vaccinations at enlistment, but commanders are restricted in requiring the use of the moderna and pfizer-biontech coronavirus vaccines, which have received emergency use authorization from the food and drug administration but have not received the standard fda approval.\n\nad\n\nservice members are younger and healthier than the population on average, but infection outbreaks have interrupted operations

airborne transmission of the coronavirus, kaiser health news's christina jewett reports . in a letter sent to the cdc on monday, the experts say that broader use of n95 masks, better ventilation and

(the washington post)\n\nfact-checking the administration\n\nvice president kamala harris gets two pinocchios for her claim that the biden vaccine plan was starting from scratch.\n\nthere was no national strategy or plan for vaccinations. we were leaving it to the states and local leaders to try and figure it out. and so in many ways, we're starting from scratch on something that's been raging for almost an entire year! harris said in a recent axios interview.\n\nbut the vice president's statement directly contradicts with a comment by fauci. we certainly are not starting from scratch, fauci said during a white house press briefing last month.\n\nwashington post fact-checker glenn kessler waded into the dispute. he notes that vaccinations under the trump administration reached a seven-day average of 980,000, virtually the goal of a million shots a day that biden had set for himself. but biden administration officials say that the plan set up by the trump administration did not have a solid national strategy for vaccinating people once the first stage of inoculating health-care workers and long-term care residents was complete.\n\nad\n\nkessler's verdict: harris gets two pinocchios for her comment — not an outright lie but misleading. biden administration officials may be proud of what they have accomplished, but they shouldn't suggest that nothing was in place when they walked in the door, he writes.\n\nvaccine dilemmas\n\nhealth officials worry that people may become picky about which vaccine they get.\n\nnews coverage and social media posts about clinical trial results are creating a hierarchy of covid vaccines in the minds of much of the public: 'good vaccines' and 'bad vaccines.' the former you might try to seek out; the latter might even prompt you to step out of line, stat news's helen branswell reports.\n\nclinical trials showed that vaccines made by astrazeneca and johnson & johnson are effective against the coronavirus, but less so than the ones made by moderna or by pfizer and biontech. still, experts point out that the narrative is not that simple: astrazeneca's and johnson & johnson's vaccines were being tested in clinical trials after new variants of the coronavirus started to circulate widely, which may have reduced their efficacy compared to the vaccines that completed their trials earlier.\n\nthe post's akilah johnson explains the challenges the biden administration faces to distribute the vaccine to low-income, vulnerable communities equitably. (joy yi/the washington post)\n\nas more vaccines are authorized in the united states, experts worry that people may become choosy and turn down certain vaccines, potentially making it harder to reach herd immunity.\n\nto me, one of the trickiest things about this is that we are likely to end up with a vaccine — the j&j — that is showing somewhat less effectiveness than these amazing first two that came out of the gate and is also most appropriate for rural settings, low-resource settings, settings without really great freezers, alison buttenheim, an associate professor of nursing and health policy at the university of pennsylvania, told stat news.\n\nother news\n\nreports of carbon monoxide poisoning are pouring in as people turn to desperate measures to stay warm amid record cold.\n\na deadly winter storm left 3.2 million people without power and with no heat for more than 24 hours in texas. desperate to stay warm amid record-low temperatures, some people have turned their cars on in the garage or sought to hear their homes using charcoal grills. the result has been a spike in reports of carbon monoxide poisoning, the post's paulina villegas reports.\n\nhud's failure to enforce its environmental standards contributed to children living in lead-contaminated housing.\n\nan inspector general report obtained by the post found that the department of housing and urban development had failed to identify health risks to residents of public housing near toxic waste dumps in an east chicago, ind. apartment complex, the post's tracy jan reports.\n\nthe west calumet housing complex was built in 1972 atop a former lead smelting plant. even after the environmental protection agency discovered high levels of lead in 1985, hud's indianapolis field office did not conduct the required environmental reviews, according to the report.\n\na 1998 investigation by the u.s. department of health and human services found that 30 percent of children under 6 years old in the community had elevated lead levels, which can damage the developing brain. but people continued to live in the apartment complex until it was deemed uninhabitable in 2016.
in fact, as gallup reported wednesday, the number of uninsured americans has increased during trump's time in office, from a low at the end of barack obama's second term in office — a function of the implementation of the affordable care act (known more generally as obamacare). the attitude of trump's administration toward obamacare has varied from indifferent to overtly hostile.\n\nthe only significant change to the law that's been made during trump's presidency is a repeal of the mandate that people have coverage. it is now the case that a fifth of those younger than 25 and more than a quarter of those who make less than $25,000 a year don't.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhealth care was a central issue in the 2018 midterms, with democrats often focusing on the issue in campaign ads. those ads leveraged republican hostility to the affordable care act and a lawsuit targeting the law to raise the specter of a decline in coverage and a loss of coverage for preexisting conditions — to good political effect for the party.\n\nthe more liberal arm of the democratic party, though, has been pushing for years to go further. what in 2004 was a fairly quiet push for single-payer — that is, government-centralized — health care championed by former vermont governor howard dean had, by 2016, become sen. bernie sanders's (i-vt.) medicare-for-all campaign platform. as 2020 looms, announced democratic primary candidates have broadly supported the idea of going a step further than obamacare in ensuring coverage for all americans.\n\nthis isn't an uncommon pattern in presidential politics: in an effort to secure support from primary voters, who tend to be more politically extreme, candidates espouse positions that are further from center. the challenge, though, is that candidates might become committed to positions that become liabilities with the necessarily more-moderate electorate that votes in the general.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npolling from kaiser family foundation released wednesday suggests that medicare-for-all could fall into that trap.\n\nthe pollsters offered four ways of changing the health-care system to expand coverage, including medicare-for-all (which they described as having a national health plan … in which all americans would get their insurance from a single government plan). a majority of americans viewed the idea favorably to some extent — but it also had the most and strongest opposition.\n\nmuch of that was driven by strong opposition from republicans. slightly more than half of independents viewed the idea positively — but that's much lower than the three-quarters who backed the other proposals included by kff. support among democrats for medicare-for-all wasn't particularly strong, generally matching support for the other proposals.\n\nwhat's more, several arguments that might be used against the idea of creating a single-payer plan spurred sharp opposition to the proposal. that it guarantees coverage and would eliminate out-of-pocket costs was popular; that taxes might increase and delays might increase were not. (note that some of these arguments would themselves be contested.)\n\nasked what they would like to see the house majority that swept into power in the 2018 midterms do, most democrats picked bolstering obamacare over passing medicare-for-all.\n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean they'd prefer a presidential candidate who prioritized obamacare over medicare-for-all; some respondents might be recognizing the reality that trump, his rhetoric aside, almost certainly wouldn't sign such a bill into law. as noted above, primary candidates are also in the business of pushing the envelope, often with hopes of at least improving existing legislation even if not achieving a more extreme policy goal.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin a normal year, in other words, embracing medicare-for-all might seem like a risky proposition for a democratic primary candidate. but 2020 will not be a normal year.\n\nthe republicans are all but certain to nominate as their candidate the incumbent, trump, who is deeply unpopular nationally and loathed by democratic voters. just as trump benefited from antipathy by some toward hillary clinton in 2016, trump's eventual opponent will certainly benefit from trump's unpopularity. what's more, trump will probably again dominate much of the news coverage before the election — but this time, much will be focused on his administration, which is unlikely to appeal to many democrats or independents.\n\nthis was the argument made by supporters of sanders in 2016: that while his positions were more liberal than the norm (and than clinton), he could have beaten trump simply by virtue of not being clinton running against a very unpopular republican. the energy he engendered from democratic primary voters might, they argue, have been key to goosing turnout enough for a victory.
toward the end, spicer gave an impassioned defense of why trump dwells so much on things like his inauguration crowd size, arguing that trump is very frustrated by constant negative coverage and the media minimizing him. he basically said it amounted to a defense mechanism from the president. it was really rather interesting.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbelow is the full transcript. we'll highlight all the most interesting parts (and make sure to scroll to the bottom for that last part). to see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text.\n\nspicer: good afternoon, everyone. thanks for coming out to our first official briefing here in the brady room. i was going to start with a recap of the inauguration, but i think we've covered that pretty well. by the way, just as i get started, i know that josh earnest was voted the most popular press secretary by the press corps, so after reading -- checking my twitter feed, i shot josh an e-mail last night letting him know that he can rest easy, that his title is secure for at least the next few days.\n\nlet me begin by saying that the president has been closely monitoring the severe weather in the southeast. he spoke by phone with governor deal of georgia yesterday and offered his condolences and support. today, president trump is focused on fulfilling his pledge to pursue trade policies that put america first.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe president began his day with a breakfast with key u.s. business leaders where the focus of the discussion was on job creation and growing our manufacturing base.\n\nbusiness leaders who attended included michael dell, founder and ceo of dell; jeff fettig, the ceo of whirlpool; mark fields, the ceo of ford; alex gorsky, the ceo of and johnson and johnson; marillyn hewson, the ceo of lockheed martin; klaus kleinfeld, the ceo of arconic; andrew liveris, the ceo of dow; maro longi, the ceo of u.s. steel; elon musk of spacex and tesla; kevin plank of under armour; mark sutton of international paper; wendell weeks, the ceo of corning; chief of staff reince priebus; chief strategist steve bannon; the vice president's chief of staff, josh pitcock; and senior adviser steven miller.\n\nthe breakfast was an opportunity for the president to hear directly from america's top business leaders about the challenges they're facing and take some suggestions about what policies and action can be taken to help them create jobs and grow our manufacturing base. the meeting included a really great exchange of ideas and the president has decided to reconvene the group in a month and then have them meet on a quarterly basis.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nas you know, the president's vision is to negotiate fair trade deals that create jobs, increase american wages and reduce america's trade deficit. he's appointed a tough and smart number of trade experts who will fight on behalf of american workers. with that vision in mind, the president has already taken several steps today.\n\nfirst, he issued a presidential memorandum withdrawing the united states from the trans-pacific partnership. tpp is a multilateral agreement that includes the united states and 11 other countries. as the president has said many times, this type of multinational agreement is not in our best interest and he's moving quickly to advance trade policies that increase the competitiveness of the american worker and manufacturer.\n\nthis executive action ushers in a new era of u.s. trade policy in which the trump administration will pursue bilateral trade opportunities with allies around the globe. this is a strong signal that the trump administration wants free and fair trade throughout the world.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nadditionally, the president issued a memorandum reestablishing the mexico city policy, stating that the united states will end the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas along with coercive abortion and sterilization practices.\n\nfinally, the president issued a memorandum outlining executive branch hiring. this memorandum counters through dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years. in particular, it prevents filling vacant positions and creating new positions except when necessary to meet national or public security responsibilities. it does not apply to military personnel and it ensures that the american taxpayers get effective and efficient government.\n\nearlier in the day, the president spoke with egyptian president el-sisi. they discussed ways to deepen the bilateral relationship and support egypt's fight against terrorists and bolster egypt's home- grown historic economic reform program. president trump underscored the united states remains strongly committed to the bilateral relationship, which has helped both countries overcome challenges in the region for decades. the president committed to working -- continuing to (inaudible) military assistance to egypt and working with egypt to ensure that assistance most effectively supports the egyptian military's fight against terrorism.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe president also commended president el-sisi for his courageous steps to address egypt's economic challenges and offered to discuss ways the united states could support egypt's economic reform program. finally, the two leaders discussed a visit to the united states in the future.\n\nthe president then had lunch with the vice president, where they recapped this morning's meetings and discussed next steps. they also had discussed plans to advance the president's legislative agenda to make america safer and more prosperous.\n\nalso today, the president signed (ph) designations for acting heads of executive departments and agencies to maintain continuity in those critical positions.\n\nad\n\nat three o'clock, union leaders and front line workers will meet with the president to discuss his pro-worker agenda. attendees include tom flynn of the united brotherhood of carpenters; sean mcgarvey, president of the north american building and construction trades department; terry o'sullivan, general president of the laborers; international union of america -- of north america; mark mcmanus, the general president of united association; donald mullins (ph), steamfitters united association local 602; frank spencer, united brotherhood of carpenters; doug mccarron, general president, united brotherhood of carpenters; mark coles of ironworkers local 5; joseph sellers junior, the general president of the sheet metal workers union/smart union; thelma m. matta (ph), the heat and frost insulators and allied workers (ph) local 24; mark urkowski (ph), united association local 5; steven dodd, the sheet metal workers union/smart union, gary macino (ph) the sheet metal worker's union smart union. the president has been honored to received tremendous support from union working men and women on election day and he's dedicated to growing and deepening their support. and he made it a priority to meet with these union workers on our working day one, here in the white house. the off shoring or american jobs and lack of economic growth in recent years, has hit american workers particularly hard. and the president's top priority is to retain and attract american jobs, which have already seen happening through his actions on carrier, sprint, general motors and so many more.\n\nad\n\nat 5:00 the president will host a bicameral (ph) bi partisan meeting with leaders here at the white house, will include the vice president, the senate majority leader, the senate majority whip, the senate minority leader, the senate minority whip, the house speaker, the house majority leader, the house democratic leader, the house democratic whip, the white house chief of staff, our chief strategist, chief of staff to the vice president, and chiefs of staff from those respective offices.\n\nthe purpose of the meeting is to get the president's agenda moving through congress. the american people are frustrated with the lack of progress here in washington and the president wants no delay in addressing our most pressing issues. he's taking every step -- opportunity to forge strong bonds with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. one of the other subjects that's sure to come up is the status of his nominees during this meeting.\n\nad\n\nit's important to note that at this point in 2009, president obama had seven of his nominee's confirmed on day one and five more in the first week. as it stands today, we have two. democrats even held up the confirmation of cia director mike pompeo, needlessly leaving one of our most important national security agencies without its top leader on day one. it's time for senate democrats to stop playing political games with the core functions of government and to allow president trump's unquestionably qualified and talented group of cabinet nominees to get to work on behalf of the american people.\n\nad\n\nrounding out today's schedule, after the reception that i mentioned, he will have dinner with -- oh we have a meeting with the house speaker paul ryan. they will discuss the republican legislative agenda and strategy going forward. early in the day the president nominated former new mexico, congress woman heather wilson as the next secretary of the air force. she grew up in key new hampshire and made history as part of the third u.s. air force academy class that included women.\n\nshe earned her master's degree and doctoral degrees as a rhode's scholar at oxford in england and then served as an air force officer in europe during the cold war and on the national security office under president george h w bush.\n\nad\n\nas you know we're all about big viewerships and large audiences here. so i want to tell you about an effort that we're undertaking here in the press briefing room to offer up more access to a group of journalists from around the country.\n\nad\n\nbeginning later this week, i'm excited to announce that we're going to have four -- what we call skype seats, live here in the briefing room. this will open up the briefing to journalist's who live beyond 50 miles of the washington d.c. area and to organizations that don't currently have a hard pass. as always any organization is welcome to apply for a day pass. but we're excited to open up into the field and fold here, a diverse group of journalists from around the country, who may not have the convenience or funding to travel to washington. i think this can benefit us all by giving a platform to voices that are not necessarily based here in the belt way.\n\nlooking ahead, the president will have a breakfast tomorrow with the auto industry, including heads of gm, chrysler and ford. he looks forward to hearing their ideas, on how we can work together to bring more jobs back to this industry in particular.\n\non wednesday the president will host a swearing in ceremony from new secretary of homeland security, general james kelly -- john kelly. and then on friday he will do the same for secretary mattis at the department of defense. on thursday he will travel to philadelphia to attend the republican house and senate retreat. and on friday he will welcome his first foreign head of state, british prime minister, may. with that i look forward to taking your questions.\n\ndaniel halper, new york post?\n\nquestion: thank you. when will the -- when will you guys commence the building of the border wall?\n\nspicer: when we what?\n\nquestion: when will you start the building of the border wall?\n\nspicer: i think that the president has noted that this was a serious priority of his throughout the campaign. he has already started to work with congress on the appropriations avenue of that. and so he is doing everything he can to direct agencies and congress to commence with that work as soon as possible.\n\nquestion: what about with obamacare, are you guys enforcing the mandate or not?\n\nspicer: enforcing the mandate?\n\nquestion: yes, the obama care mandate? kelly ...\n\nspicer: i think -- look the president has made it clear that he's going to work with congress to -- and part of the discussion that he's going to have tonight with some of these leaders, and then again with paul ryan, is how we can work to implement the -- both the repeal and the replace aspects of this.\n\njennifer wishen (ph)?\n\nquestion: of all the policy, or actions that a president could have taken today, he chose to reinstate the (inaudible) policy. what message is sending here? does he see the elimination reduction of abortions as an american value? and also here at home, can full (ph) life american's expect him to put his signature that will defund planned parenthood.\n\nspicer: well i think the president, it's no secret, has made himself-made it very clear that he's a pro-life president. he wants to stand up for all americans including the unborn and i think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects tax payer funding as well. and ensure that we're standing up, not just for life, for life of the unborn but also for tax payer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the values of this president . and i think continue to further illustrate, not just to the folks here in this country, but around the world what a value we place on life. jennifer rodriguez (ph).\n\nquestion: janet (ph).\n\nspicer: janet (ph). i'm sorry.\n\nquestion: thank you. what did mr. (ph) curtis (ph) mean when he said that he would work through congress to get special something - we don't what it is (inaudible) recipients? and when can we expect that to happen? and also when can we expect the white house spanish site to be back up?\n\nspicer: ok. two questions. let me start with the latter first. as you know, we hit the ground running on day one. there was a lot to do and we had done a lot of work on the website to make sure that we were prepared to get as much information up as fast as possible. we are continuing to build out the website, both in the issue areas and then that area. but we've got the i.t. folks working overtime right to continue to get all of that up to speed. and trust me, it's just going to take a little bit more time, but we're working piece by piece to get that done.\n\non the daca piece. i think the president has been clear that he was going to prioritize the areas of dealing with the immigration system, both building the wall and making sure that we address people who are in this country illegally. first and foremost, the president's been very, very clear. that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record - a criminal record or oppose a threat to the american people. that's where the priorities going to be and then we're going to continue to work through the entire number of folks that are here illegally. but right now the clear focus is on that.\n\nblake burman (ph) fox.\n\nquestion: hey sean, i want to ask you two questions money (ph) related. the president campaigned on a corporate tax cut rate of 15 percent and today when he met with the business leaders, he had mentioned that the tax rate would drop to somewhere between 15 to 20 percent. is he moving the goalpost there in anyway? and my second question is on government spending, there have been reports that you might be looking at $10 trillion over the course of 10 years. is that accurate? and would you be willing to wrap up entitlements to get there?\n\nspicer: well i think first, well i'll take the other one first on entitlements - or on spending. look, i think you saw this with the hiring freeze. there's been frankly, to some degree, a lack of respect for tax payer dollars in this town for a long time and i think what the presidents showing through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today, is that we've got to respect the american tax payer. they're sending us a ton of money, they're working real hard.\n\nsome people are working two, three jobs just to get by. and to see money get wasted in washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes. and i think that that comes into your question, in overall spending as well. we've got to look at how we're spending the american people's tax money.\n\nand so what the work that the landing teams have been doing is going into these agencies and departments and talking about way that we can create greater efficiencies, eliminate duplicity and find - maximize the tax dollar. so it's more a question instead (ph) of (ph) just cutting, it's about how do we spend and respect the american tax payer dollar more than - more - more going forward.\n\napril ryan?\n\nquestion: fifteen to 20 percent? sorry (ph).\n\nspicer: oh, i'm sorry. look, the presidents a very successful businessman and negotiator. he's going to sit down and work with congress to get the best deal possible for american businesses so that they can hire more people and we expend - and we can grow the economy. so he's going to work with congress on that rate but he understand better than anybody how to negotiate a great deal. and right now he's going to negotiate the best deal on behalf of the american worker and on behalf of the american businesses that are hiring them. that was a lot of the focus that went on today, talking to these companies. and it was interesting, the meeting was only supposed to last an hour, it overflowed another hour in the oval office and he kept asking them what ideas do you have to grow this economy? what is preventing you from hiring people?\n\nspicer: what regulations are stopping you from conducting more business? what are the ways that we can give you more market access into other countries around the globe? and i think that's what his focus is going to continue to be, is how do we create a tax and regulatory environment that grows the economy and benefits the american working? so it's not just about creating more jobs but it's also about lifting up those job through higher wages.\n\napril ryan?\n\nquestion: sean, i have a couple of questions if you'll allow me to take them one at a time.\n\nspicer: i will.\n\nquestion: elijah cummings, maryland congressman -- democratic maryland congressman, confirmed that president donald trump talked to him at the luncheon about the high price of prescription drugs.\n\nwhen is this meaning and -- going to be set or is it coming up soon? and will the president be meeting with the full body of the congressional black caucus as well as the hispanic caucus on issues related to those communities?\n\nspicer: ok. let's take them one at a time.\n\ni am not -- i'm not aware of that conversation. i'm sure you've heard the president the last few weeks talk about the price of pharmaceutical drugs, and the need to get those prices down and bring manufacturing back in the pharmaceutical industry to benefit the country.\n\nso it's an issue that's gonna -- he's gonna continue to work on. he understands as we reform health care, as we repeal and replace obamacare, that getting a hold of the cost of prescription drugs, to give more people access to them, but also to allow greater access in health care -- greater plans in health care, that's going to be key part of it.\n\nso, he's gonna -- i mean, that's gonna happen.\n\ni think, look, you're seeing with respect to the other meetings, it's day one -- working day one here. he's gonna start with the leadership. he's gonna have a great conversation with them.\n\nbut then i think you're gonna see a variety of meetings: the congressional black caucus, the hispanic caucus, small groups of leaders (ph).\n\nhe is -- you know, he's someone who really enjoys that kind of conversation. i think you're gonna see a lot of meetings occur like the ones that you did today, the business leaders coming in, these union workers.\n\nand it's interesting, i -- we -- the president was asking these folks today, how many of you have been here (ph) in the oval office? three of them raised their hands. we talked to some of these union leaders, and we hear, we didn't get a lot of attention.\n\nand here we are in working day one, and you've got the president reaching out to some of america's best business leaders and then some of the union workers and line workers, and bringing them in and saying, i want to listen to what's going on in your life. what can we be doing to help you?\n\nand i think that you're gonna to see a lot more of that, a listening president who's engaged in trying to figure out what policies and actions that he can take, that this government can take, that he can work with congress to make people's lives better, to make their -- their security better, to make their economic security better.\n\nbut you're gonna see a lot of that. that's who he is. that's what he did during the transition. and i think that's he's gonna do going forward.\n\nhe appreciates the ideas and opinions that come -- that come through the oval office or small groups, where he gets to share their prospective and their ideas and their opinions. i think that's what he's gonna continue to do later this afternoon.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: i'm sorry, april?\n\nquestion: i'm sorry.\n\ni want to go back to what the gentleman said about the mandate -- the (inaudible). he said something about the obamacare (inaudible) in the mandate.\n\nwith the numbers that we talked about and the new news (ph) from the inauguration day and the numbers (ph) saturday, do you believe that you have a mandate to be able to force through what you had talked about, replacing portions of obamacare, that really subsidized a whole piece of it to help low-income people get health care?\n\nspicer: well, i think what we have is a -- is a mandate to make health care more accessible and lower costs. that's what the american people were promised under obamacare.\n\nand i think it's not a question about a mandate and it's also not about forcing anything, it's about what's doing the right thing. it's about providing people what they've been promised. which is, you -- you go around this country and you look market after market, they're down to one plan. that's not what the american people were promised.\n\nnot only that, but in many cases you're seeing these -- the rates go up 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 percent. that's not what they were promised either. and so what i think the president's doing -- and it's not just -- i think he's gotten bipartisan support for this.\n\nto work with congress and to take executive action where necessary, to implement a healthcare system that provides more people heathcare, truly allows them to keep the doctor and plan that they're signing up for, lowers cost, creates more competition.\n\nso, do i think he has a mandate? sure. but it's not just -- it's not about -- it's not on this issue, i think that all leaders have a mandate for the american people, to fix this system and make it better.\n\njulie pace (ph)?\n\nquestion: thank you sean.\n\ni've got two foreign policy topics i want to get to. there's some discrepancy between what goes up (inaudible) and what the pentagon is saying in terms of some potential (inaudible) action.\n\ncan you clarify that? and generally, is the president open to joint action in syria with the russians?\n\nspicer: (inaudible) i know it's still developing and i would refer you back to the department of defense. i know that they're -- they're currently monitoring this and i would refer you back to them on that. and i think...\n\nquestion: generally open?\n\nspicer: i think, the president has been very clearly. he's gonna work with any country that shares our interest in defeating isis. not just on the national security front, but on the economic front. if we can work with someone to create greater market access and spur economic growth and allow u.s. small businesses and companies to...\n\nquestion: (inaudible) doing joint military actions with russia in syria.\n\nspicer: i -- i think if there's a way that we can combat isis with any country, whether it's russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we'll take it.\n\nquestion: and then the second thing is (inaudible) the cia, on saturday he was talking about the u.s. not taking oil during the iraq war. and said that there could be in another pinch for that. what does he mean when he said that?\n\nspicer: well, i think what the president seemed very clear about in foreign policy is too often the united states is going in with a lot of money, a lot of man power, and in many cases, losing both, loss of life -- and we want to make sure that our interests are protected. and so if we're going in to a country for a cause, i think that he wants to make sure that america's getting something out of it for the commitment and the sacrifice that we're making.\n\nquestion: (inaudible)\n\n(off-mike)\n\nspicer: no, i think that he's been very clear throughout the campaign that he is committed to making sure that the american people, the american tax payer, see some benefit, and ensure that our interests overseas are not just (inaudible) sending blank checks. that we're doing something that either protects america or is in our economic interest.\n\nquestion: (inaudible)\n\nspicer: john roberts (ph).\n\nquestion: a couple things if i could. later this week, in his executive actions, does the president plan to take action to green light the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines? and on tpp, joe mccain says it was a serious mistake to do what the president did for america's economy and for our strategic position in the asia- pacific. why was tpp the right thing to do?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: -- the right thing to do, to repeal tpp?\n\nspicer: oh, i think i said it, because i think the multi -- when you enter into these multinational agreements, you're allowing any country, no matter the size -- any one of those 12, including us, to basically have the same stature as the united states in the agreement. so we're basically on par with some very small companies who are getting access to an amazing market, the united states. and in return, we're negotiating at the lowest common denominator. and i think that when you look at big multinational agreements -- multilateral agreements -- they're not always in the best interest of the united states.\n\nthe beautiful thing about a bilateral agreement is that if any one of the true parties in the agreement decides at any time they want to get out of the agreement, or they're not being treated fairly, they can renegotiate much easier. in a multinational agreement, that's not the case. in many cases, all of the other countries have to agree to an action or to let somebody out. that's not putting the u.s. interest's first.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) -- question about keystone and the dakota access?\n\nspicer: i'm not gonna get in front of the president's executive actions, but i will tell you that areas like dakota and the keystone pipeline, areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into america's energy supply more, that's something that he has been very clear about. i think he talked about it, not only on the campaign, but around the thanksgiving period. he was talking about that being a big priority. that's one of those ones where i think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where i think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to america's benefit. it's good for economic growth, it's good for jobs, and it's good for american energy.\n\njonathan karl (ph).\n\nquestion: thanks for being here at (inaudible), it's great to see you.\n\nspicer: thank you.\n\nquestion: before i get to a policy question, just a question about the nature of your job.\n\nspicer: yeah.\n\nquestion: is it your intention to always tell the truth from that podium, and will you pledge never to knowingly something that is not factual?\n\nspicer: it is. it's an honor to do this, and yes. i believe that we have to be honest with the american people. i think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. there are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. but our intention's never to lie to you, jonathan. our job is to make sure that sometimes -- and you're in the same boat -- there are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story, and you publish a correction. that doesn't mean that you were trying to deceive readers and the american people, does it? and i think we should be afforded the same opportunity. there are times when we believe something to be true, or we get something from an agency, or we act in haste because the information available wasn't complete, but our desire to communicate with the american people and make sure that you have the most complete story at the time. and so we do it.\n\nbut again, i think that when you look net-net, we're going (ph) to do our best every time we can. i'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as i know them. and if we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it. but i don't -- i think that as i mentioned the other day, it is a two-way street. there are many mistakes that the media makes all the time. they misreport something, they don't report something, they get a fact wrong. i don't think that's always -- you know, to turn around and say, okay, you were intentionally lying. i think we all try to do our best job, and do it with a degree of integrity in our respective industries.\n\nquestion: do you have any corrections that you would like to make, or clarifications on what --\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: sure -- ask away, jonathan.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) i don't want to get into it or relitigate the whole issue, but like, on the issue of metro ridership, you made a statement about --\n\nspicer: we did, and at the time that was provided by the inaugural committee came from an outside agency that we reported on. and i think knowing what we know now, we can tell that wmata [washington metropolitan area transit authority] numbers are different, but we were trying to provide numbers that we had been provided. that wasn't like we made them up out of thin air.\n\nquestion: and do you stand by your statement that was the most watched inaugural --\n\nspicer: i think --\n\nquestion: -- address of the --\n\nspicer: sure, it was the most watched inaugural. when you look at -- look, you look at just the one network alone got 16.9 million people online. another couple of the networks there were tens of million people that watched that online. never mind the audience that was here, the 31 million people watching it on television.\n\ncombine that with the tens of million of people that watched it online, on a device. it's unquestionable. i -- i don't -- and i don't see any numbers that -- that dispute that when you add up attendance, viewership, total audience in terms(ph) of tablets, phones, on television. i'd love to see any information that proves that otherwise.\n\nquestion: and -- and then, what --\n\nspicer: so, do -- do you dispute that?\n\nquestion: well, i don't want to get into numbers. i -- i --\n\nspicer: well, i do. i mean --\n\nquestion: ok.\n\nspicer: i'm just saying, you're asking me a question about my integrity. i have a right to say if you add up the network streaming numbers, facebook, youtube, all of the various live streaming that we have information on so far. i don't think there's any question it was -- that it was the largest watched inauguration, ever.\n\nquestion: more than ronald reagan's in 1981?\n\nspicer: i'm pretty sure that reagan didn't have youtube, facebook, or the internet.\n\nquestion: (off-mic)\n\nspicer: yes, i think 41 million people watched his. 41 million watched his. ok? so, let's just take the nielsen ratings, which are 31 million and add it to cnn, 16.9 million. that's a little higher. so, i'm just saying, i'm not -- you're asking me for numbers, there's just two entities together.\n\nquestion: and -- and the -- the approach that you took on saturday are(ph) there(ph) any second thoughts on that?\n\nspicer: look, i did word(ph) -- john lewis(ph) -- look, i -- i want this to --\n\nquestion: (off-mic) question, you know.\n\nspicer: i came out to read a statement, and i did it. we're here today, i'm going to stay here as long as you want. so, i want to make sure that --\n\n(off-mic)\n\n(laughter)\n\nspicer: i think you guys might want to leave before i do. but look, i want to make sure that we have a healthy relationship. we saw the other day that -- and i'm not trying to rehash history, but you're asking the question so i'm going to answer it. you know, we had a tweet go out about martin luther king.\n\nthink about how racially charged that is. and someone rushes out and says to the entire press corps that the president of the united states has removed the bust from his office. do you -- i mean, think about what the signal -- hold on, please.\n\nquestion: (off-mic) and apologized?\n\nspicer: no, no. he actually apologized to my colleagues. that's the exact quote. ok? that quote, that report got tweeted out around. and to report -- where was the apology to the president of the united states? where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was? where was that apology?\n\nquestion: you accepted his apology, though.\n\nspicer: ok, i'm asking where was that apology? and so, i'm just saying that when you -- when things like that happen, when john lewis says that he's never missed an inauguration and we find out actually he did, under -- he skipped george w. bush's, that there are points in which we have a right to make sure that we correct the record.\n\ni mean, you're talking about integrity and you're talking about telling the truth and facts. i don't know that it wasn't malicious at all, and i'm not saying. but there is a point at which we have a right to go out there and correct the record. and i think that over and over again, there is this attempt to go after this president and say, well, that can't be true and that's not right and the numbers weren't there.\n\nand there's a rush to judgment every time. and it's a two-way street. we want to have a healthy and open dialogue with the press corps and with the american people about what he's doing to help this country and to unite it.\n\nbut in a time when he's trying to unite this and he keeps talking about uniting this nation, bringing this nation together, and then a tweet goes out in a pool(ph) report to -- what? -- a few thousand people saying that he removed the bust of martin luther king, how do you think that goes over?\n\nquestion: sean, did -- did the media invent the feud between the president and the intelligence community?\n\nspicer: look, i'm not -- i think that you saw from the response the other day, he walked into the cia, people were hooting and hollering, they gave him a five minute standing ovation. that doesn't look like a relationship that's a -- i mean, they were excited --\n\nquestion: look(ph) at(ph) the(ph) media(ph) invention(ph) --\n\nspicer: no, no. but i think there's a difference between having differences with intelligence leaders and leaders of that community who we have strong differences with than the people and the men and women who toil every single day in our intelligence community.\n\nspicer: and it was reflected at the cia. i mean, they came there. they were so excited, there was 1,000 people that applied for 3,000 plus seats. and we ended up taking in 400 people. that doesn't sound like a huge feud. they were excited, they were clapping, they were cheering when he walked in.\n\nand to see reports that made it sound like there was some, you know, fence mending that needed(ph) to happen, that sure didn't look that way when you walked in. i'm going to move on.\n\nyeah?\n\nquestion: sean, can i ask what is the u.s. strategic interest in moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem? and also, in the chat with president el-sisi today, was the status of the muslim brotherhood discussed?\n\nspicer: i think the readout -- i just gave you the readout on the call with president el-sisi. i think that -- that speaks for itself what was discussed. and then -- i'm sorry, the first part?\n\nquestion: what is the u.s. strategic interest in moving the embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem?\n\nspicer: well, i don't -- as i noted yesterday through several press inquiries, we haven't -- there's no decisions. we're at the very early stages of that decision-making process.\n\nyeah?\n\nquestion: john (inaudible) from bbc.\n\nwill there be a detailed discussion when prime minister may comes on friday on the potential parameters of what have a trade deal might look like? is there going to be a joint news conference? and is donald trump going to get a state (ph) visit back to the u.k. later in the year?\n\nspicer: well, look, we're here on working day one. we're excited that prime minister may is coming on friday. we look forward to it. i'm sure that there will be a discussion of trade will come up, the degree to which i don't know yet and i'm sure we'll have an opportunity to brief you out. i don't believe we have any plans right now for a joint press conference, but that's something that our team will be working out with prime minister may and we'll keep you updated on that. yeah?\n\nquestion: (inaudible) news. after the executive order withdrawing the u.s. from the tpp, what specific steps will president trump take to expand u.s. trade opportunities abroad?\n\nspicer: well, again, i -- i think when he talks to prime minister may, he's gonna have a great conversation about the potential for greater trade with the u.k. i mentioned earlier when he met with these manufacturers this morning, that was, you know, right up there at the top of that list, how can we get greater market access? what are the specific challenges that these manufacturers are facing getting market access in the countries around the globe? and that's an important issue.\n\nso it's not -- it's not just other countries, but within existing trade deals, we can figure out is there a trade dispute that can be settled with the wto, is there a revision to one of the existing trade treaties that we have now? but there's a lot that can be done. there are things that congress can update to make sure that we're importing and exporting more to benefit american businesses.\n\nquestion: thanks. john cruz (ph) from (inaudible).\n\nhas the president or will the president have a chat, even an informal chat, with the prime minister before, in fact, she comes here?\n\nspicer: there are no plans for that now. it's always possible. he's been having a tremendous number of calls. i think the number is well over 80 now of people that have talked to him, congratulated him prior to being elected. he's had a -- we read out the other day he's met with both canada and mexico. i think he's talked -- prime minister netanyahu yesterday, president el-sisi today. i think there's -- there's going to continue to be a robust number of world leaders.\n\nthere's a, you know, a tremendous excitement i think in the diplomatic corps and at the world leader level of people who are excited that president trump and this administration want to engage. there is a lot of times when he's talking to these folks and they're saying, i have not heard from anyone in years. and i think that there is a genuine excitement to reengage the united states, especially in the area of trade and other economic interests, but also in the area of national security.\n\nquestion: needless to say, this is a big one and it's the first...\n\nspicer: i'm sorry?\n\nquestion: i said needless to say, this is the big one, and it's the first.\n\nspicer: right.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: tpp was dead on arrival (inaudible), so why this executive order anything more than symbolic? and when will president trump start negotiating those bilateral deals with the 11 other countries in the asia-pacific? could take some time and that could be, some would say, giving china, you know, room to make an inroad.\n\nspicer: well, first, i would argue that bilateral deals are mostly what china's been engaging in, and that's something that i just said that we're gonna -- you know, the president's gonna look to countries to engage with.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) 11 tpp countries?\n\nspicer: most of them we have existing trade agreements with -- or a good chunk of them, we have existing trade agreements to -- to being with. this was an expansion of that, and some in areas, it allowed, whether it was the service industry, financial services, additional market access.\n\nbut i think that this is -- this is not a deal that was in our country's best interest. the president could have come into office -- a president could have come into office and renegotiated it and sent people back to the drawing board. it hadn't gone to congress yet because it wasn't finalized. i think this president pulling out of the agreement is not just about this one agreement, but i think it's symbolic both here in america and around the world of a new era of trade policy, one that's going to put american workers first and foremost and one that assures the rest of the world that the way that we negotiate bilateral agreements is going to ensure that we get something out of these deals.\n\nas i mentioned to john a minute ago, i mean, the problem with multilateral agreements is that often, we -- it becomes the lowest common denominator on so many things. and for the u.s. (inaudible) already has low tariffs and other service industry benefits for countries, you know, we've gotta be able to make sure we're going out and fighting for the american worker.\n\njennifer (ph)?\n\nquestion: so (ph) you're not gonna renegotiate, to be clear...\n\nspicer: we pulled out of tpp.\n\nquestion: no but if all the existing...\n\nspicer: i'm -- i'm not gonna -- there -- we'll have further updates on trade issues later this week, jennifer (ph).\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...does the administration feel like you still need an executive order to remove yourself from nafta or what's the...\n\nspicer: i -- i -- that's a great question. i believe there's an action that has to be taken under the -- the provision of nafta where you set -- you send notice to the other countries, the other two countries.\n\nthe exact nature of how that's described, i don't -- but it is, there is a trigger within nafta, one of the sections allows the -- the president of the united states to notify them that we intend to do that.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: ok hold on (inaudible).\n\nquestion: will there still be a north american trade block or something different or...\n\nspicer: again, i think part of is it that he's already spoken to both the president of mexico and prime minister of canada about his desire to -- to renegotiate. and i think as he meets with both of these individuals over the next 30 days or so, that's gonna be a topic.\n\nnow, if they come in and -- and express a willingness to do that, you could negotiate it within the current parameters and update it through -- through the existing structure. if they don't and he decided to -- to pull out, then we would have to go back to the drawing table in the future.\n\nmara (ph)?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: ...make sure mara (ph) gets a question, this time.\n\n(laughter)\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...time (ph). just to follow up on the china question. china actually has the regional agreement called the regional comprehensive economics partnership and now japan and australia, two of our great allies are talking about joining that.\n\ndoes -- does the president trump see a national security component to these trade deals and is he concerned that now china will write the rules for asia-pacific trade?\n\nspicer: well, i think he has been very, very clear about china's place in the -- in the geopolitical landscape of economically and -- and national security wise. so he understands the need, that's part of the reason that trade is important, bilateral trade.\n\nit provides a check on a lot of this. but again, i -- he's always gonna be fighting for the interest of the country and the american worker. so where -- how we engage and with whom, is gonna be decided on whether or not we can get a deal that benefits our country, economically and in terms of national security. that there are there things that we can do economically, that actually end up also benefiting us from a national security standpoint because of the economic relationship that exists between the two countries.\n\nyes, sir?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...a follow-up on...\n\nspicer: ok. mara (ph) gets a follow-up.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...i'm sorry...\n\nspicer: no you earned it.\n\nquestion: thank you. just really simple (ph), what is the average national unemployment rate?\n\nspicer: what's the average?\n\nquestion: what -- no, i mean what's the overall unemployment...\n\nspicer: are you talking about whether or not we include the full...\n\nquestion: i'm just asking...\n\nspicer: i mean the bureau of labor statistics puts (ph) it out.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...of u.s...\n\nspicer: no, no, no, it's not a question of what i accept. i mean there are ways that you can put out full employment...\n\nquestion: and i know the different...\n\nspicer: right, but i'm saying that -- so there's a reason that we put out several versions of that. one is that it -- the illustrative nature of -- of how you count the unemployed, whether or not they're long term unemployed or whether or not they're still seeking a job.\n\nbut there's a reason that you put out several of these statistics, its so that economists can view them and decide, look at different landscapes on -- what -- on -- on how to -- how to make economic policy.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...during the campaign, he at one point, trump at one point said it was 42 percent. i just wanna...\n\nspicer: well, again...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: ...on where we're starting.\n\nspicer: but -- but again, part of it is economic team is gonna look at a multitude of statistics and drive economic policies. his goal is obviously, to get as many americans working together. that's his ultimate goal.\n\nis that when he sees people that are hurting, that haven't had wages lifted up, that are unemployed, that can't save for their kids future, that are having a trouble with their healthcare costs, that's what he really cares about.\n\nit's not just a number to him, it's about -- it's someone getting by, are their wages going up, can they find a better job, do they have access to education, whether its higher education, college or a votechnical -- a votech kind of school, so that they can train for the skills of the next century.\n\nthose are the kinds of things the president, he's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether or not the american people are doing better as a whole and whether or not a family.\n\nand it was interesting, i know when we talked about carrier at one point, someone said well, that's a thousand jobs. when you talk about those thousand jobs and their families, during the holiday season i would beg to differ that those people were unbelievably ecstatic that the president and the vice president intervened.\n\nand so every one of these meetings that you saw happen at trump tower and then now, its all about you know, whether it's 2,000 or 20,000 jobs, that's -- that's the focus. it's making sure that we have -- that small businesses have greater opportunity to be successful.\n\nthat american workers can have their wages lifted up, that the benefits that they receive in terms of healthcare and education are something that -- that provide them the support that they need. but that's what this is all about.\n\ni think for to often in washington, we get our heads wrapped around a number and a statistic. and we look at and we forget the faces and the families and the businesses that are behind those numbers. and so, i think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his event, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say mr. trump, i'm working as hard as i can. i'm working two jobs, i'm doing everything by the rules, and i keep getting screwed.\n\nthat's what he's fighting for is that man or woman out there that's doing everything they can right but can't catch a break. and i think he addressed that in his inaugural speech when he talked about shifting power outside of washington d.c. back to the american people because for too long it's been about stats more (ph) and it's been about, what number are we looking at as opposed to what face are we looking at?\n\nquestion: i have two questions. one on dac - on daca (ph), i was just curious about the message from this administration from the white house to young people who may qualify and not yet have their pension. should they enroll going forward and those who are in the program now seek renewal?\n\nspicer: well, i think - yeah, what the - what those people should know is that the president's laid out a list of priorities and the priorities are focused on making sure that people who can do harm or have done harm and have a criminal record are the focus. and as he said throughout the campaign, we've got a series of individuals who we've got to figure out. people who've overstayed their visas, people who have committed crime, and we're going to go through that in a very systematic and methodical way.\n\nso for now, that's not - the focus is going to be on people who have done harm to our country.\n\nquestion: 2016 was the hottest year on record and the last three years have been the hottest three years on record. scientists are saying that we're getting dangerously close to the point where human civilization is being threatened. how does president trump plan to address this?\n\nspicer: well, i think - i think he's going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment but i think that there's - one of the things that he talked about during the campaign is there's a balance and he's trying to make sure that we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we don't do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation.\n\nso, there's a balance and i don't think it's an either/or situation. we can ensure that we're doing things that are smart for the environment and smart for our longevity as well as making sure that we're doing things that create economic growth and job creation.\n\nquestion: what is the president's message to the millions of people here in washington and around the country who were protesting on saturday? i have a follow-up after that.\n\nspicer: ok. i have that's (ph) very polite of you.\n\n(laughter)\n\ni think he has a healthy respect for the first amendment and he - you know, this is what makes our country so beautiful, is that on one day you can inaugurate a president, on the next day, people can occupy the same space to protest something. but he's also cognizant to the fact that a lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything. i remember this morning, debbie dingell was on television and she's talking about - let me just, i don't want to inaccurately quote her.\n\ni know jonathan's (ph) a stickler for that.\n\n(laughter)\n\nshe said different women were there for different reasons but they were all there to make sure that their core american values are going to be protected and i think many people like me were there for positive reasons. and i think the president shares debbie dingell's views that there were people that came to the mall as they do all the time, sometimes in smaller numbers...\n\nquestion: ...how does he reach out to them (ph)?\n\nspicer: i think he reaches out to them in a way that he started on the night that he won the election, on the way that he did on inauguration day by sending a message that talks about fighting for them. but more importantly, i think the president's going to show through action and through success that he's fighting for them and fighting for every american. one of the things that we've seen so often in this town is a lot of soaring rhetoric about how much people care.\n\nand i think the president is going to show through deed and action and success that he wants to fight for people's healthcare, he wants to have a better education system, he wants a stronger america, he wants to go in and fix our inner cities, he wants to make sure that our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges. so, i think more than anything, showing people through action and deed and success is where he's going to prove to the american people how much he cares to unite us and how much he cares to make this america better and safer.\n\nquestion: and a follow-up. on the other side of this, another group that's coming...\n\nspicer: ...i forgot, you did ask.\n\nquestion: i did, thank you for remembering.\n\n(laughter)\n\nanother group - and this a follow-up on cbn's question a moment ago, when we have the march for life here in washington, you've said that this is a pro-life president, what concrete promises is he making? we haven't heard a lot about what that policy is going to look like.\n\nspicer: it's day one.\n\nquestion: yeah, but you've had a lot of time to make those promises.\n\nspicer: i know but i - look, i think...\n\nquestion: ...what should their expectations be?\n\nspicer: their expectation should be that he's going to stand up and value life, born or unborn. same as he said throughout the last year and half, that he's going to stand up and protect life, promote it, and instill policies that promote life, that promote adoption, that help support young women, that help support funding of - of agencies and clinics that support women's health.\n\ni think that's what he's going to talk about is supporting all of life, the born, the unborn, throughout life making sure that we have healthcare that can support the american people and the american families. that's -- that's what he's gonna fight for and that's what he's gonna be clear on.\n\nquestion: i have two questions.\n\nspicer: ok.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) first one, with the congressional meeting today and also at the retreat, you said talking about his legislative agenda. besides healthcare, can you give us one, two or three legislative things that he wants to get through right away? so not the executive actions, legislation.\n\nspicer: right. immigration's obviously going to be high on that last. tax reform, regulatory reform. that's three and four.\n\nquestion: immigration is not a overhaul, though, not...\n\nspicer: well, i think he's gonna work with congress to get the appropriations process going. but it's not -- it's not just building the wall. that's through the appropriations process. it's how do we enact policies to make sure that what we have now doesn't happen again. and so it's -- it is -- it is working with them.\n\nit's a comprehensive look at how we're keeping people out of this country that shouldn't be here, that people who are coming to visit are leaving when they're supposed to, to make sure that we're tailoring immigration policies that make sure that we're not an open door for anyone to just walk in, that the people who are here to visit our country safely or to come here to bring jobs or to support our economy are coming in. but i think he have to do immigration smartly, and that's what he's looking at.\n\nquestion: i had a second one.\n\nspicer: i'm sorry. you're right.\n\nquestion: i haven't heard that you al -- you said or someone else has said specifically. will the president -- has the president spoken to any of the intelligence agencies about the investigation into the russian connections? and will he allow that to go on?\n\nspicer: i don't believe he has spoken to anyone specifically about that and i don't know that -- he has not made any indication that he would stop an investigation of any sort.\n\nyes, sir?\n\nquestion: clarification. you said you're willing to work with anybody to defeat the islamic state (inaudible). does that include bashar al-assad?\n\nspicer: well, i think -- i think what it's gonna -- what we're doing -- we are going to smartly do this. i mean, let's be clear. part of it is to make sure that they have america's interests in what they're doing and who they are. so we're not gonna get together with people under guise of defeating isis if that's not truly their guise or if they're not -- so let's -- let's not take that too far. thank you.\n\nyeah?\n\nquestion: sean, will the president release documents showing that he has left his businesses?\n\nspicer: i believe we have.\n\n(unknown): they're not public at this time.\n\nspicer: but yeah, he has -- he has resigned from the company, as he said he would, before he took office. don and eric are fully in charge of the company. he has taken extraordinary steps to ensure that that's happened.\n\nyeah?\n\nquestion: (inaudible) political priorities. what would be the message for the hispanic commune in the u.s. taking into consideration that one of the priorities has been the wall?\n\nspicer: what...\n\nquestion: what would be the relation between this administration and the hispanic community in the u.s.?\n\nspicer: well, i think his relationship with the hispanic community is going to be great. i think he's -- as i said, i think that whether it's jobs or education or healthcare, the president is committed to uniting all americans and working towards a better, safer, more secure, more prosperous america that benefits everybody. and i think whether -- regardless of your background, that's something he is committed to.\n\nyeah?\n\nquestion: (inaudible) financial times. does mr. trump agree with rex tillerson that the u.s. should try and prevent china from accessing the islands in the south china sea where it's building runways and other kinds of facilities?\n\nspicer: i think areas in the south china sea that are part of international waters and international activities i think the u.s. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there. so it's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of china proper, then yes, we're gonna make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country. does that answer...\n\nquestion: would you prevent china from actually reaching...\n\nspicer: i'm not gonna -- look, i think i answered the question. i think as we develop further, we'll have more information on that.\n\njohn gizzi?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: thank you, sean. thank you, sean.\n\nspicer: hold on, i'll get to you. i promise.\n\nquestion: and welcome to your first day on the job.\n\nspicer: thank you.\n\nquestion: very simply, there was an earlier question about jerusalem and putting the u.s. embassy there and a lot of talk about executive orders. is this something the president can accomplish by executive order?\n\nspicer: it is, but i think as i noted, john, it's very early in this process. we are at the beginning stages of this decision-making process and his team's gonna continue to consult with stakeholders as we get there.\n\nyes, ma'am.\n\nquestion: thank you, sean...\n\nspicer: of course.\n\nquestion: ... and welcome here.\n\nspicer: thank you.\n\nquestion: so i have a follow-up on the housekeeping question about nafta. are we not to expect, then, an executive order today to renegotiate nafta or will he wait until he meets with president pena nieto next week? and on the other -- the other question i had is, he didn't mention latin america at all in his -- you know, in his inauguration speech. does he plan to visit latin america this year?\n\nspicer: so on the first part, i think we'll have further announcements on trade throughout the week. i don't...\n\nquestion: it's not gonna happen today?\n\nspicer: i think we're done with executive orders for the day. but as i always say, stand by. but we do not have any intention to have additional executive orders today. but i believe there could be some additional ones throughout the week on trade. and we'll have further updates for you on there.\n\nand then the second part?\n\nquestion: if he plans to travel to latin america, given that he left them out of his inauguration speech?\n\nspicer: right. well, i don't think -- i don't think he left them out. i think he was focused on this country, our -- our american workers. i don't think he got into detail on any countries that i am aware of or that i can recall.\n\nbut i also think we are here on the first working day. we're announcing theresa may coming this friday. we're excited to have the prime minister here. as i said, we already talking about setting up a meeting with canada and mexico. he's talked to prime minister netanyahu about having him come over. and then as i mentioned, president el-sisi.\n\nso, we'll get there. we -- we got a lot of calls to return. there's a lot of excitement through the world. and a lot of people who are really excited, both to come here, and have the president visit them.\n\nyes, sir?\n\nquestion: sir, last week on lgbt rights. the long time republicans (inaudible) group delivered a white paper to the trump team, urging the president to maintain an executive order from president obama, borrowing anti-lgbt worker discrimination among federal contractors.\n\npresident has said he gonna resin (ph) the executive orders from president obama that are unconstitutional, but will he maintain this executive order of borrowing anti-lgbt...\n\nspicer: yeah, i -- i don't know on that one. as i -- i'll have to get back to you on that one. i don't know that we've gotten that far on the list of executive orders, but i'll be glad to get back to you.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: what's that? again, it's not -- i just don't know the answer. i'll try to get back to you on that one.\n\nyes, sir?\n\nquestion: on immigration, the chief of staff -- i think, it said over the weekend, seemed to suggest that an executive order shutting down the daca program had been ruled out. is that officially ruled out as you guys go forward? and does the -- does the president support action in congress that would, essentially permanently establish those protections for those.\n\nspicer: yeah, i think -- i don't have anything further on the executive action front. but what i -- i think i've asked and answered the -- the daca piece to this, in terms of his priorities right now.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: (inaudible) the legislation?\n\nspicer: i -- i think that we'll have to -- we don't have anything in front of us right now to sign on. so give us a little bit of time, we'll see what congress moves forward with, and then i'm sure we'll have a further read out on both, the executive order piece and on the legislation.\n\nyes, sir?\n\nquestion: (inaudible) resettlement program?\n\nspicer: i don't know. i'll -- i'll have to get back to you on that one right now. or -- i think the best thing to do, would probably contact the department of state.\n\nyes, sir in the back?\n\nquestion: regarding -- regarding access -- access for american companies to the national markets, will the president try to improve the access to the largest market and develop the european one? by taking (inaudible)\n\nspicer: well, look, i don't -- i think, he's gonna increase market access wherever he can. he's in the process of reviewing all of our current trade agreements. and looking at potential bilateral options going forward, whether it's in the e.u., or in the asia- pacific arena, or in the middle east.\n\nhe's gonna figure out where we can expand u.s. market access. and that's i think, what today's decision really starts to show. is that it's not about multilateral agreements under a trump administration. it's about bilateral agreements, where we can figure out country to country, how can we fight for the american worker, gain them access to another market that's gonna benefit our large and small businesses who want to sell additional goods and services.\n\nyes?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: why did the president choose the british prime minister as the first foreign leader for him to meet? and can we take from that that he intends to make the relationship even closer?\n\nspicer: i think we've always had that special relationship with britain. and -- and he's gonna -- and that reflects in -- in his first visits -- the prime minister's first visit here. he's had a great conversation with her and he looks forward to having her here. but we can always be closer.\n\nyes, ma'am? question: (inaudible) news, what kind of relationship is trump looking for to build with china after he withdraw from tpp? and on taiwan's issue, what kinds of stand he is going to make on (inaudible)\n\nspicer: what's the last part, please?\n\nquestion: taiwan (inaudible) relation.\n\nspicer: well, i -- i think, on china, he understand what a big market that is for u.s. goods and services. when he met with the head of alibaba a couple of weeks, that -- that was part of the point. there's huge market issue there. but in many cases, it's -- it's not a two-way street.\n\nthere are so many chinese businesses and individuals frankly, who can have ease of access in the united states to sell their goods or services. i think that whether or not you're talking about the financial services or the banking, you know, the other service industries, or our manufacturing goods and services, or some of the ip problems that we have with china, that it really is not a two way street. and so he understands the market that china has and our desire to further penetrate that market. but he also recognizes, there's a lot of concerns with how we are treated entering into china's market, and we need to review that.\n\nyes ma'am? i think we're going to have further -- a lot further updates on that. yes ma'am?\n\nquestion: welcome. question following on what she was asking about the tpp. you know, part of the thinking of tpp was to encircle china economically and i wonder if the president has thought a little bit about what kind of bilateral relationships in the region -- trade relationships would accomplish a similar goal, and secondly, i heard you talking about nafta and a trigger, but i didn't hear you say you had triggered the trigger.\n\nspicer: we have not triggered the trigger, hasn't happened. but again i think we have an existing relationships with many of the countries that were part of the 12 nation make up of tpp. and i think we're going to continue to explore how we can -- in some cases strengthen those relationships or look for bilateral agreements with nations that we didn't have one through tpp.\n\nyes sir?\n\nquestion: sean, congratulations.\n\nspicer: thank you.\n\nquestion: social security and infrastructure. on social security, the president will be meeting tonight with congressional leaders. what's he going to do given his campaign promise on not touching social security when paul ryan and mitch mcconnell send him a bill that declaims (ph) in a funding package various cuts in social security. and on infrastructure, has it fallen off the radar screen, or is it going to be -- stay a priority for the president? spicer: so on social security, he's going to have to talk to them, i think he's been very clear with his priority is in terms of preserving and protecting this really important benefit to our seniors. he understands -- i mean, the -- mr. trump's employed so many people over the years, he understands the struggle that people have later in life to continue to make ends meet and i think that he is keenly aware of how important this program is to so many people in their later years. and so he's going to continue to fight to make sure that that's a program that is preserved and protected.\n\nand then on the ...\n\nquestion: infrastructure.\n\nspicer: infrastructure, of course, yes. that's definitely -- and he's continued to bring that up. he talked with the business executives today about how so many of our airports, that are so important to our commerce system, getting planes to land in and out, roads and their ability to truck things across the country, even our freight system. that if our infrastructure is not strong, it inhibits our ability to have free commerce, it inhibits -- it drives up the cost of goods and services, when someone's got to take a different route. or is limited in the opportunities that they have because their runway might be closed or it can't be expanded or a rail line breaks down. or highways just not -- the wear and tear it puts on trucks or shut down. so infrastructure continues to be huge priority for him. yes sir?\n\nquestion: two questions, the national security council -- sacking (ph) of the national security council, when do you expect to have that -- those positions filled?\n\nspicer: we've gotten many of them filled.\n\nquestion: (inaudible).\n\nspicer: i'd have to get back to you on the number but it's actually fairly robust right now. there are a lot of hold over's, but general flynn has been working diligently with k.t. mcfarland -- his deputy and others to make sure that that's filled out and ready to go. he's had countless meetings with counterparts and had several folks detailed over. but it's a very very robust efforts from day one.\n\nquestion: and follow up to don carls (ph) question. so are you retracting your claim on saturday that it was the largest crowd in person for the inauguration?\n\nspicer: that's not what i said.\n\nquestion: well you said it -- this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period. both in person and around the globe.\n\nspicer: right. to witness ...\n\nquestion: both in person and around the globe... spicer: ... and around the globe. yes. in total audience it was.\n\nquestion: in total audience, but not simply in person.\n\nspicer: but that's right, but again i didn't say in person. both in person and around the globe, to witness it.\n\nquestion: you're saying those together?\n\nspicer: no, that's actually what i said. it's not what -- i don't know how you can interpret it differently. that's literally what i said. to witness it in person and around the globe. total audience yes.\n\nquestion: but not for in person?\n\nspicer: hold on. hold on. let me just ...\n\nquestion: but -- but -- but not -- but you're saying here just to clarify, you're not saying and you weren't saying on saturday that it was the largest inaugural crowd in person ...\n\nspicer: i am not. i am saying that it was the total largest audience witnessed in person and around the globe.\n\nyes sir?\n\nquestion: (inaudible) go back to one publisher (ph) (inaudible). those with knowledge of who was in the room in the lobby of the cia that senior leadership were not among those hooting and hollering and that were some 40 people who were in the first front rows who were brought in by trump and pence and pompeo. i'd like to give you a chance to respond to that recording.\n\nspicer: i don't think that's accurate at all. in fact i think if you list to the audio of it, you can hear the excitement that exists there. there were some people that had to be off camera for obvious reasons, but i think when you look at the number of people that were there, the audio alone tells -- tell -- you know, speaks volumes to what had happened.\n\ni don't -- i don't think that there's any question about that.\n\nquestion: so the people in the -- the front who were seen on camera, those were cia employees?\n\nspicer: honestly, i don't have a seating chart. i think we had a very small footprint going over there. i don't know who exactly went over. but, i don't -- i don't know, maybe 10 people, at most. sarah was there(ph).\n\n(unknown): yes.\n\nspicer: 10 were in our -- were in the travel going over. so, 10 out of 400, plus. question: but the people -- the people who(ph) were(ph) in the front row, so those were cia employees?\n\n(unknown): some of them.\n\nspicer: some.\n\nquestion: some of them were not?\n\nspicer: i'm sure we seated -- i don't -- i can't say -- i'm not really sure why this matters. i mean, 10 people didn't yell that loud.\n\nquestion: just admit(ph) -- you know, the senators(ph) were hooting and hollering --\n\nspicer: yes, they were.\n\nquestion: there's not this rift between the intelligence community and the president because senior authorities within the intelligence community are telling cbs news that they are uncomfortable with that portrayal. and then the notion that people within the cia are --\n\nspicer: i -- i -- i -- all i can do is tell you to listen to the tape alone. i think you can hear a lot of that. yes?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: a couple questions that i've(ph) been down here for awhile. has the president formerly requested or received pentagon advice on how he could change the campaign against the islamic state?\n\nspicer: i think he has ordered it. he's going to -- as i mentioned, he'll be at the department of defense on friday to swear in general mattis as his next secretary -- well, to, you know, go through the ceremony of that. he is obviously the secretary of defense. and so, you know, at that time he will continue to have conversations about what he wants from -- from them and the joint chiefs. shannon(ph)?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: just a follow up.\n\nspicer: yes and then --\n\nquestion: i don't -- i don't mean to beat a dead horse on the issue of the u.s. embassy in israel.\n\nspicer: right.\n\nquestion: but, can you -- at the end of the president's first four years, assume(ph) he's -- you know, at the end of the next four years, will the united states embassy be in jerusalem?\n\nspicer: well, i -- i think i've answered it twice now. i -- we are at the early stages in this decision making process.\n\nquestion: but it's not whether, it's when and how?\n\nspicer: i -- i -- there's a reason you go through a decision making process. and that's what we're in the process of starting right now. so, i just don't want to get ahead of -- it would -- if it was already a decision, then we wouldn't be going through a process.\n\nquestion: yes, he did say that --\n\nspicer: ok, i just answered the -- thanks, julie. jim?\n\nquestion: first of all, congratulations and thanks for taking my question. getting back to saturday at the cia and your statement here at the podium. why make this crowd side issue -- or crowd size issue something to talk about at all? i mean, why get into it? did it bother the president that much that he felt that you needed to come out here and straighten that out for us? and why did he choose the cia as the venue to talk about that?\n\nspicer: so, two things. one, i just got handed a note. all of the people -- no one in the front row was trump. they were all cia.\n\nquestion: front row?\n\nspicer: that's what you asked.\n\nquestion: i said the first three rows.\n\nspicer: ok. i'll find out who the other two were. (laughter) i'm sorry, i just got you the front row, give me a second, i'll get the second and the third. do you want to get to the fourth and fifth, or -- ok, let me see what i can do. look, i think that one of the things that happened, jim, was he kept hearing about this rift that existed.\n\nhe talked about it a couple of weeks ago at his briefing about how proud he is and how much he respects the intelligence community. and i think when he walked into that and he saw it, he wanted to make sure that people knew that what you're hearing on television or in reports about this rift -- i -- i have the utmost respect for you, i honor your service, i'm proud of what you're doing and the sacrifices that you're making.\n\nand i think that he wanted them to know that you see and hear all of this stuff on t.v. about this rift that so-called exists and clearly it doesn't matter; like, don't believe what you're hearing, know that i -- i -- i have a tremendous amount of respect for you, i appreciate everything that you are doing.\n\nand i think that's why he wanted to do it is to make sure that they understand they heard first hand how much he respects them. how much he wanted to dispel the myth that there was a rift.\n\nquestion: but -- but in terms of the crowd size issue, why bring that up at the cia? and why did you come out saturday afternoon to talk about that? did he tell you, sean, i'm upset about this, i want you to come out and --\n\nspicer: no, i'm not going to get into conversations that i have with the president. but i will tell you that it's not -- it's not just about a crowd size. it's about this constant -- you know, he's not going to run. then if he runs, he's going to drop out. then if he runs, he can't win, there's no way he can win pennsylvania, there's no way he can win michigan.\n\nspicer: then, if won, it's oh, well he(ph) -- there is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has. and i think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.\n\nquestion: and -- and if i may --\n\nspicer: hold on -- because i -- i think it's important. he's gone out there and defied the odds over and over and over again. and he keeps getting told what he can't do by this narrative that's out there. and he exceeds it every single time. and i think there's an overall frustration when you -- when you turn on the television over and over again and get told that there's this narrative that you didn't win. you weren't going to run. you can't pick up this state.\n\nthat's not -- you know, that's a fool's errand to go to pennsylvania. why is he in michigan? how silly, they'll never vote for a him. a republican hasn't won that state since '88. and then he goes and he does it and then what's the next narrative? well, it must have been because of this. he didn't win that. and then people aren't attending anything or john lewis is the first person to skip his inauguration. not true.\n\nand over and over again, the mlk bust. i think over and over again there's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents. and it's frustrating for not just him, but i think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out. and so i mentioned this to john, part of this is a two- way street. we want to have a healthy dialogue, not just with you but the american people because he's fighting for jobs, he's fighting to make this country safer.\n\nbut when you're constantly getting told that can't be true, we doubt that you can do this, this won't happen, and that's the narrative when you turn on television every single day, it's a little frustrating.\n\nand i think that for those people around him, his senior team especially, but so many of the other folks that are either here in the administration, that gave up their time during the transition, they left a job to work for three or four weeks because they are so committed to having his nominees get through, it's a little demoralizing to turn on the tv day after day and hear, can't do this, this guy's not going to get confirmed, not way they're going to go through.\n\nquestion: but isn't that just part of the conversation that happens in washington...\n\nspicer: no, it's not. i think...\n\nquestion: ... in d.c., that comes from being president of the united states and working at the white house?\n\nspicer: no. no, look, i've been doing this a long time, you've been doing this too. i've never seen it like this, jim, i've never -- and again, i'm not looking to go back and forth, but you're asking for an explanation.\n\nand i think that it's important to understand, that whether it's the president himself, the vice president, the senior team, the volunteers or the people who are out there just in america that voted for him or walked the streets or put up a sign, that to constantly be told no, no, no and watch him go yes, yes, yes every time and to come up to the next hurdle and see someone put a block up gets a little frustrating.\n\nand i think that we are -- and so, you see this historic thing. and he stands there at the capitol and i was not that close but, you know, on the platform, and you look out and all your -- it's an amazing view. and it's just so many people who got in long lines, who had to go around all this different stuff to get in. and that was for the first time that we did have to go through fencing that far out.\n\nand then to hear, well, look at this shot, and it's not -- it wasn't that big. it's a little demoralizing because when you're sitting there and you're looking out and you're in awe of just how awesome that view is and how many people are there and you go back and you turn on the television and you see shots of comparing this and that. and then you look at the stuff that's happening.\n\nthe nominees to get put out (ph), the democrats stopping -- there are two cabinet officials, ladies and gentleman, that are taking their office today. he visited the cia and a director that was considered a consensus candidate wasn't approved. where's the story? and i think that -- so it...\n\nquestion: isn't it a fair criticism that you've got bigger fish to fry? why worry about a couple of tweets about crowd size?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: because it's not -- because that's what i'm saying, you're minimizing the point here, jim. it's not about one tweet. it's not about one picture. it's about a constant theme. it's about sitting here every time and being told no. well, we don't think he can do that, he'll never accomplish that, he can't win that, it won't be the biggest, it's not gonna be that good. the crowds aren't that big, he's not that successful.\n\nthe narrative -- and the default narrative is always negative and it's demoralizing. and i think that when you sit here and you realize the sacrifice the guy made, leaving a very, very successful business because he really cares about this country and he wants -- despite your partisan differences, he cares about making this country better for everybody. he wants to make it safer for everybody. and so when you wake up everyday and that's what you're seeing over and over again and you're not seeing stories about the cabinet folks that he's appointing or the success that he's having trying to keep american jobs here. yes, it is a little disappointing.\n\nso, i just -- it's -- you know...\n\nquestion: it's not always going to be positive.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nspicer: no, it's not, and sometimes we'll make mistakes. i promise you that. but it's not always got to be negative, jim. some days, we do do the right thing. some days we are successful. so it's not -- part of us is saying, when we're right, say we're right. when we're wrong, say we're wrong. but it's not always wrong and negative. there are things -- there's a lot of things that he's done already, a lot of amazing people that he's appointed, a lot of success that he's having.\n\nand it would be once -- nice once in a while for someone just to say -- report it straight up, he appointed this person, here's their background. not why they're not gonna get nominated, not why it's not gonna happen.\n\nquestion: thanks, sean.\n\nspicer: hold on. one last thing. hold on.\n\ni can't -- i know we're getting really into like facts. so just to be clear, there were no trump or white house folks sitting down. they were all cia (inaudible). so not in rows one through anything, from what i'm told.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ni appreciate julie's effort, but i want to -- i've hallie (ph). john, you got one. give me a second.\n\nquestion: so, sean, a couple -- a couple of questions here, if you don't mind.\n\nfirst one on russia. the administration was asked about multiple interactions between national security adviser mike flynn and a russian ambassador. i believe you at the time -- the administration at that time said it's -- the calls were related to setting up a discussion later between president trump and vladimir putin.\n\nspicer: that's right.\n\nquestion: were those conversations about anything else other than setting up that discussion? and why has that discussion not yet happened between the president and president putin?\n\nspicer: so there's been one call. i talked to general flynn about this again last night. one call, talked about four subjects. one was the loss of life that occurred in the plane crash that took their military choir, two was christmas and holiday greetings, three was to -- to talk about a conference in syria on isis and four was to set up a -- to talk about after the inauguration setting up a call between president putin and president trump.\n\nthat -- i don't believe that that has been set up yet because the call was to say -- they did follow up, i'm sorry, two days ago about how to facilitate that call once again. so there have been a total of two calls with the ambassador and general flynn. and the second call came -- i think it's now three days ago -- that was to say once he gets into office, can we set up that call? it hasn't -- to my knowledge, has not occurred yet.\n\nquestion: any other conversations between general flynn and russian members of the government?\n\nspicer: not that i'm aware of. and when i say that, what i'm saying is during the transition, i asked general flynn that -- whether or not there were any other conversations beyond the ambassador and he said no.\n\nquestion: and one more follow-up on julie's questions from here...\n\nspicer: ok.\n\nquestion: ... on a statement that the president made on saturday. can you -- and i just want to clarify your answer here.\n\nspicer: yeah.\n\nquestion: can you unequivocally state that this administration will not send more troops into iraq to, as the president has put it, take the oil?\n\nspicer: i'm not gonna talk about what we may or may not do. i think the president's been very clear that he doesn't telegraph forward what -- taking options off the table. that's not a good negotiation skill. that's not how he works. there's a reason he's been successful at negotiating, is because he does it in a way that doesn't telegraph to people what he's gonna take on or off the table.\n\njeff mason.\n\nquestion: where's the president's thinking now on the supreme court? (inaudible) naming some nominees? and in a follow-up to...\n\nspicer: you get two.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: narrowing down his nominees, i should say.\n\nspicer: ok.\n\nquestion: and at the end of the obama administration, the number of prisoners in guantanamo bay was reduced to about 40.\n\nspicer: right.\n\nquestion: what are the president's plans for that prison?\n\nspicer: so on the first, i -- i think that in the next week or so, we should have an update on a nominee for the supreme court.\n\nquestion: (off-mike)\n\nspicer: it does. i think we will have a nomination within the next couple weeks. he continues to make that a priority of his.\n\non gitmo, i think you're gonna see further action. i don't want to get ahead of the president, but this is something that has been discussed and has -- it is in his current decision-making process how he wants to handle that.\n\nquestion: and as a follow-up...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: if i could just ask one more. you said that the president disagreed with the characterization of a rift with the intelligence community?\n\nspicer: that's right.\n\nquestion: do you dispute, though, his tweet about comparing the intelligence community to nazi germany?\n\nspicer: i -- no. i think what he was talking about was the process, not the people, and that's a very different thing.\n\nshane.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) three months ago then candidate trump was in gettysburg and he made a list of day one promises. he called it a contract with the american voters. a bunch of them are not gonna get done today because you said he's done with making executive orders; labeling china a currency manipulator and posing congressional term limits (inaudible). i wanted to ask you why not pursue all those on day one, as he promised in a contract with the voters?\n\nspicer: well, i think he is -- we're going to continue to sequence those out. i mean, part of it is to make sure that we don't spend our entire day signing executive orders and (inaudible). there's a way that we can do this to make sure that we're getting all of those things that he promised the american people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn't just jam them out in a fire hose.\n\nand i think part of this is ensuring that we sequence these, that gives the american people the proper -- issue the proper attention that they deserve because part of it is that when -- and if we put them all out in one day, they get lose -- they get lost in the ether, i think, and i think he made these promises and pledges to the american people because they're important to him. so...\n\nquestion: he still plans to (inaudible) that day one list, though?\n\nspicer: that's his intention, yes. he's very clear about that.\n\nyes, sir.\n\nquestion: is the president going to shake up the leadership of cfpb before the director's term's up?\n\nspicer: i'm not going to - no decision has been made at this time on that.\n\nquestion: one on obamacare. has he finished his plan on obamacare, when will the american people see that...\n\nspicer: ...i think he...\n\nquestion: ...and then on nafta, can you just clarify? i know he's going to meet with the leaders of mexico and canada. has he started to have discussions with them currently about renegotiating nafta...\n\nspicer: ...yeah, so, yeah, on obamacare, i think he's going to continue the discussion tonight with speaker ryan in particular at the meeting that he's going to have after the reception. when it comes to the - the - i'm sorry, the other part was nafta...\n\nquestion: ...nafta.\n\nspicer: there's - he discussed on the phone with both leaders his desire to reform it but obviously his goal was to have that discussion when they come in person and i think i mentioned yesterday the foreign minister of mexico's going to come on the 25th, 26th to sort of set the table and have some of those meetings ahead of president pena nieto's meeting here.\n\nquestion: (inaudible) ...now that he's officially in office, don't they...\n\nspicer: ...well again, he's been - this is his first working day. i think it's been pretty busy and robust not just today but in the 2 1/2 other days that we had. and i think you're going to see a lot more come - come out but, you know, there's a lot of things that have to get done and a lot of things that we're working on as a staff to get him prepared. he's going to continue to have very, very robust weeks.\n\nthank you, guys. i appreciate it. this was a good first one.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nquestion: one more, please?\n\nspicer: go ahead. question: first of all, congratulations.\n\nspicer: thank you.\n\nquestion: and also, there has been (inaudible) ...community. my question is around the last two days i have gone to a number of balls - nation balls (ph) including the nation and india (ph) american ball (ph). and most of those people were supporting president modi's (ph) actions and also creating (ph). but most important, across the street from u.s.-india business council, most gain again (ph), he represents 500 fortune companies to and from india.\n\nand he said that...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n...his companies are supporting (ph) so my question is where do we go as per u.s.-india and u.s.-asia - u.s.-india restoration projects (ph)?\n\nspicer: well, look, thank you for the question.\n\n(laughter)
so it is worth revisiting what the trump administration did while congress was impeaching, from the moment the president's efforts to use ukraine as a tool in his reelection campaign was exposed in early september through today. these are not impeachable offenses, but they are the kind of misguided policies that, along with trump's impeachable conduct, should be in voters' mind as the election nears.\n\nad\n\npresident trump proposed on jan. 9 changing regulations that would speed the development of new mines, pipelines and hundreds of other projects. (the washington post)\n\nad\n\nsome of the administration's actions are lamentable but unsurprising; they embody the deregulatory instincts of any republican administration, even if they at times have a more radical, deeply destructive, edge. others, particularly in the arena of immigration, are uniquely, repulsively trumpian.\n\ntogether, they offer an unsettling picture of the administration's priorities, and suggest what a second trump term would bring. herewith, a necessarily incomplete roundup:\n\n● environment. the administration revoked one of the most significant obama-era environmental rules, over waters of the united states. the earlier regulation had expanded federal protection and regulation of such waters to include streams, ponds and even drainage ditches that feed into larger waterways. environmental groups argue that the change will result in massive loss of wetlands critical for combating climate change and threaten the drinking water supply.\n\nad\n\nthe house impeached trump, but it was a victory for alternative facts, russian disinformation and fox news, says columnist dana milbank. (the washington post)\n\nad\n\nthe administration also proposed easing environmental rules in order to speed up construction of major infrastructure projects. the proposed rule, revising an arrangement in place for a half-century, would exclude reviews of infrastructure projects built without major government involvement, set a two-year deadline for drafting and delivering most environmental impact statements, and limit the degree to which such assessments include the effects of climate change.\n\nand, acting on the first possible day to begin the one-year process of withdrawing from the paris climate agreement, the administration served formal notice to the united nations that it would abandon the accord, forsaking the global effort to combat climate change.\n\n● health care. the administration proposed letting states limit the amounts they spend on medicaid for poor adults. it invited states to transform that part of medicaid funding into a block grant and offered them new flexibility to cut coverage and benefits. block grants are a favored republican technique to limit entitlement spending, and the administration's proposal was a way to achieve, in a more limited way, what it was unable to get through even a republican congress, which balked at its effort to block-grant medicaid three years ago.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmeanwhile, having supported a legal assault on the affordable care act, the administration urged the supreme court to decline to review an appeals court decision invalidating the law's individual mandate — a delay that would leave the law's fate conveniently uncertain until after the election, and the administration conveniently spared from facing the wrath of voters who, it turns out, like their obamacare after all. having raced to the high court numerous times with claims that emergency intervention was warranted, the administration now argues that immediate view would short-circuit the ordinary judicial process.\n\n● immigration. the supreme court, dividing 5 to 4 along ideological lines, allowed a trump administration rule to take effect that will make it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain admission to the united state or secure green cards giving them the permission to live and work here. this public charge rule allows authorities new leeway to deny visas to those who they suspect could turn, at any time, to safety-net programs such as food stamps or medicaid.\n\nthe administration also expanded its already unnecessary and poorly implemented travel ban to include six additional countries, mostly in africa and including the continent's most populous country, nigeria, on the grounds that they have not done enough to identify or share information about potential terrorists or criminals.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe list goes on. the interior department is poised to weaken protections for millions of migratory birds, saying companies whose industrial activities kill birds accidentally should not be subjected to fines or prosecution. the department of housing and urban development is rolling back another obama-era rule designed to press cities to do more to combat racial segregation in housing. the agriculture department moved to tighten eligibility for food stamps in a way that the administration itself estimated would eliminate nearly 700,000 of the poorest adults from the rolls.\n\nthe impeachment process has run its course. the bad policies of this administration continue.
inmates in the women's cellblock at the fayette county jail in washington court house, ohio, a state hit hard by the country's fentanyl crisis. fighting fentanyl trump called the opioid epidemic a priority, but fentanyl deaths soar as resources fail to keep pace scroll down warning: this graphic requires javascript. please enable javascript for the best experience.\n\n— in a dungeon-like jail in the center of this depressed farming town, 18 women in orange-and-white-striped prison uniforms are crammed into a two-story cellblock. many of them are withdrawing from fentanyl.\n\nthe jail, built in 1884 to hold 24, now houses 55 men and women, a number that can swell to as many as 90. the inmates are sprawled on metal bunk beds and mattresses that line the floors as they wait for court appearances or serve time on low-level drug offenses.\n\nthe medical exam room, used to treat minor ailments, is tucked into a broom closet beneath a concrete stairwell. with few drug treatment options, prisoners strung out on fentanyl go through days of withdrawal with little help, shivering and curled up on the beds and floors of the jail.\n\nit's definitely our detox center right now. they just sit there, and they withdraw there, fayette county deputy health commissioner leigh n. cannon said. treatment is where we need help. we keep hearing that money is coming, but we haven't really seen it.\n\nthe inmates here are at least alive — unlike so many drug users in this part of central ohio, 40 miles southwest of columbus. fayette county has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to internal data from the centers for disease control and prevention obtained and analyzed by the washington post.\n\nwhile the trump administration has made the opioid epidemic a priority, people in communities across the country continue to die in record numbers from fentanyl, and health officials are struggling to provide treatment for tens of thousands more, like the men and women warehoused inside this jail.\n\npresident trump has taken a number of steps to confront the crisis, stem the flow of fentanyl into the country from china and mexico, and step up prosecutions of traffickers. congress also has increased spending on drug treatment.\n\neveryone here today is united by the same vital goal — to liberate our fellow americans from the grip of drug addiction and to end the opioid crisis once and for all, trump said at a drug abuse summit in atlanta on april 24. it's happening. it's happening.\n\nbut health policy experts say drug treatment funding is not nearly enough, and the administration's response was hobbled by the failure to appoint a drug czar in its chaotic first year and confusion over who was in charge of drug policy. the depth of the problem continues to overwhelm the government's response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by congress.\n\njohn p. walters, director of the white house office of national drug control policy during the george w. bush administration, said that after two years and a presidential commission to study the problem, the trump administration is still struggling to confront the deadliest drug crisis in u.s. history and is not dedicating nearly enough federal resources.\n\nwhat other threat that is preventable is going to kill tens of thousands of americans? walters said. we're spending much more money on terrorism, as we should, but we're not spending a similar amount on the source of death to many more americans right now.\n\n[have you lost a family member or loved one to a fentanyl-related overdose? tell us about them.]\n\nin 2017, the first year of the trump presidency, a record 28,869 people died from synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, a 46.4 percent increase from the year before. most were from fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. estimates for the first eight months of 2018, the most recent available, show that an additional 20,537 americans died — a toll on pace to exceed the previous year's.\n\nthe scale of death here is really unprecedented, and so you have to judge the response against the scale of the problem, said joshua m. sharfstein, vice dean at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. you can have some progress, but it's really insufficient if you are not up to the scale of the problem.\n\nsharfstein and other public health experts also note that the administration is seeking to repeal the affordable care act and cut $1.5 trillion over 10 years from medicaid. more than 500,000 people addicted to opioids could lose their drug treatment coverage if the aca is repealed, according to the kaiser family foundation. the proposed medicaid cuts could further reduce coverage.\n\ntrump officials said they are making progress against the epidemic on a range of fronts, including interdiction, prosecution and treatment, but they acknowledge that it remains a huge challenge.\n\nwe didn't get into this crisis overnight. we're not going to get out overnight, kellyanne conway, counselor to the president and the administration's leading voice on the epidemic, said in an interview.\n\nconway said trump views his handling of the crisis as a legacy issue and continually asks her for updates about what is taking place in the states.\n\nit can't all be gloom and doom. you can't just have the negative, harrowing, so-sad statistics of grief and loss and devastation. we have to start talking about solutions, she said. the battleship is starting to turn in the other direction.\n\nhighest annual rate of synthetic opioid deaths cabell county, w.va. 62.9 baltimore city, md. 40.8 montgomery county, ohio 36.3

highest per capita fentanyl-related overdose death rates: five counties in ohio, two in west virginia and one in kentucky and the cities of baltimore and st. louis. local health officials told the post they are still not receiving enough federal money to fund drug treatment programs to wean people off highly addictive opioids or launch prevention programs to warn people of the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nin cabell county, w.va., the county with the highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation, there are long waiting lists for treatment.\n\nwhen somebody is saying, 'i'm ready for treatment' and they want help, they shouldn't have to wait six months, six weeks or six days, said steve williams, mayor of huntington, the county seat of cabell. they should be able to get in a treatment program within six hours.\n\nin ohio, deaths from fentanyl have ravaged vast sections of the state. in 2015, there were 1,255 synthetic-opioid-related deaths, most from fentanyl. by the end of 2017, that number had nearly tripled to 3,572.\n\nin rural counties of ohio, federal money recently appropriated by congress has started to arrive, but health officials there say it is not enough.\n\nthe situation four years ago was looking desperate. today, it's looking dire, said scott gehring, president of the community health alliance, a drug treatment facility in butler county, ohio, which has the ninth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. people are sicker. more people are dying.\n\nbetween january and april 2017, 9,442 people died from fentanyl and other

synthetic opioids. elizabeth loranzo, 25, a mother and beautician from middletown, pa., was one of them.\n\nin the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, trump promised to halt the flow of heroin into the united states. he mentioned that drug, not fentanyl, at least 57 times during his speeches and appearances, and he tied the crisis to the need to build a wall along the border with mexico. on the campaign trail, trump was moved by the people he met who had lost family members to the epidemic, conway said. as he left one stop, someone called out: please follow through on the drugs and opioids. you promised.\n\ntrump also said addiction was a deeply personal issue for him. his older brother, fred jr., who suffered from alcoholism, died in 1981 at age 43.\n\non march 29, 2017, two months after his inauguration, trump invited then-new jersey gov. chris christie to the white house.\n\nchristie had told trump that his administration was inheriting an out-of-control opioid epidemic that blew up with the arrival of fentanyl during the obama administration — between 2013 and 2017, more than 67,000 people died from the synthetic drug.\n\nthe opioid epidemic had begun in the late 1990s when a generation of americans became addicted to prescription pain pills. after the government started to crack down on doctors, pain clinics, and drug manufacturers and distributors in the mid-2000s, addicts turned to heroin and then fentanyl.\n\n[what you need to know about fentanyl]\n\nin just a few years, the synthetic painkiller became the deadliest drug ever to hit u.s. streets. manufactured in chinese and mexican labs, illicit fentanyl has played a significant role in reducing the overall life expectancy of americans. it is so powerful, just a few flecks the size of grains of salt can cause acute respiratory failure and rapid death.\n\nobama administration officials were slow to address the fentanyl epidemic. the administration saw fentanyl as an add-on to the overall opioid crisis, rather than a singular danger that required a strategy of its own because it was so deadly and was coming into the country largely unimpeded through the mail. senior white house and justice department officials, motivated by a desire to rectify racial inequality in sentencing, emphasized drug treatment over incarceration, and drug prosecutions fell off as fentanyl coursed through sections of the country.\n\nfayette county sheriff vernon p. stanforth opens the door to the women's facility in april at the county jail, where inmates often go through withdrawal from drugs such as

the women's facility in april at the county jail, where inmates often go through withdrawal from drugs such as fentanyl. the county has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to cdc data.\n\nby the time trump came into office, the dangers of fentanyl were well known. the drug enforcement administration and the cdc had issued numerous warnings. the fatal overdose rate was staggering.\n\ni said to [trump] that i thought there was a lack of urgency to the way president obama's administration had dealt with this issue, and that as a result, the problem had gotten worse, christie recalled in an interview. we needed to go after this in a really aggressive way.\n\ntrump signed an executive order establishing the president's commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis.\n\nhe put the new jersey governor in charge.\n\nlet's do it, the president told christie that day.\n\nbetween may and august 2017, an

jeff sessions, launched his own assault on fentanyl.\n\nfor sessions, fentanyl could be met only by the kind of tough law-and-order tactics he deployed as a federal prosecutor in alabama during the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s. while a member of the u.s. senate for 20 years, sessions was one of the few lawmakers to rail against bipartisan efforts to roll back the harsh drug sentencing policies of that era.\n\nsessions promised to make fentanyl a signature issue after his first trip to new hampshire, a state that had experienced one of the highest fentanyl-related death rates in the country. he attended a youth summit on opioids at manchester's downtown arena with gov. chris sununu (r) on march 7, 2017.\n\none of the most dramatic moments for me was the first trip to new hampshire where governor sununu had 8,000 high school students gathered and 50 mothers stood before them holding large pictures of their children who died from drug overdoses, sessions said in an interview.\n\non may 12 that year, in one of his first actions, sessions reversed what had become known as the holder memo. the 2013 document written by then-attorney general eric h. holder jr. directed federal prosecutors to stop pursuing low-level, nonviolent drug charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences. over decades, u.s. drug policy had resulted in long prison terms and increased incarceration for first-time offenders, most of them young black men, and holder wanted to reverse what he saw as a historic injustice.\n\na deputy sheriff removes an inmate's belt at the fayette county jail in april. the ohio facility, built for 24 people, now houses 55 men and women but sometimes holds as many as 90.\n\nsessions directed his prosecutors to give high priority to drug cases, particularly aiming at fentanyl. those found guilty would face the most severe penalties possible, according to a memo he sent to each u.s. attorney.\n\nin july 2017, the justice department shut down the largest dark-web distributor of illicit drugs. called alphabay, the site allowed users to sell and buy drugs, including fentanyl. at the time of the takedown, there were 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals on the site, according to the justice department.\n\nthat fall, the department brought its first criminal charges against chinese nationals accused of selling fentanyl to americans over the internet in cases that were filed in federal courts in north dakota and mississippi.\n\nsessions used an emergency declaration to make all chemical variants of fentanyl, known as analogues, illegal on a temporary basis; congress must pass legislation to make the ban permanent. chinese and mexican chemists and drug traffickers in the united states had been evading the law by tweaking the chemical compounds that make up fentanyl and producing products that don't fit the precise chemical formula for a banned substance.\n\nsessions also ramped up federal prosecutions of all fentanyl offenses and sent additional prosecutors to 10 areas in the country with the highest number of overdoses.\n\nchristie, however, was growing frustrated with sessions's exclusive focus on law enforcement actions. he said he called the attorney general several times, inviting him to speak at the commission's public hearings. instead, sessions sent his deputy attorney general.\n\nsessions said he has long believed in prevention and treatment programs, but as the attorney general, he was responsible for focusing on drug trafficking cases.\n\ni didn't find him helpful at all on the issue, christie said. he only had one tune, which was enforcement. he didn't want to talk about the other parts of the issue. i wanted him to engage on treatment, on drug courts, and he had no interest in engaging in that. so, after a while, i just stopped calling because, what was the use?\n\nhe was a one-trick pony.\n\nbetween september and december 2017, an additional 9,940 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. samantha huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from springfield, mo., was one of them.\n\n'reinventing the wheel'\n\nbetween september and december 2017, an additional 9,940 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. samantha huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from springfield, mo., was one of them.\n\nduring trump's first months in office, the administration shunted aside its white house office of national drug control policy. the office, whose director is known as the drug czar, is responsible for coordinating anti-drug efforts across 16 federal agencies and producing the national drug control strategy, an annual drug policy plan mandated by congress.\n\nformer trump administration officials said the white house did not trust the career staffers at the office. one former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the president and his aides wanted to transcend the drug czar and raise the issue to a higher level.\n\nwhite house officials treated the drug czar's office as a backwater. they staffed it with political operatives who had little or no drug policy experience and installed a 24-year-old campaign worker as the deputy chief of staff. senior staffers with years of experience were sidelined. in may 2017, the administration proposed cutting the office's budget by 95 percent.\n\nohio's butler county has the ninth-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the united states, according to cdc data. four other ohio counties are in the top 10.\n\nno one was immediately nominated to become the drug czar. as the trump presidency entered its seventh month, there was no permanent official in charge of coordinating drug policy across myriad federal agencies — the cdc, the national institute on drug abuse, the justice department and the department of homeland security.\n\nlawmakers on capitol hill were growing impatient with the administration's lack of plans to confront the opioid epidemic. on july 26, the house oversight and reform committee summoned then-acting drug czar richard baum, who had been in his job for four months, to explain why he had not submitted a comprehensive plan to operate and fund the office.\n\nany idea when it might be submitted? rep. gerald e. connolly (d-va.) asked baum.\n\ni don't want to give you a timeline, baum replied. but i can tell you this. i've studied the issue very closely.\n\nlikewise, we need a strategy, connolly said. any idea when a strategy will be submitted to the congress?\n\nwe're developing a strategy now, baum said.\n\nthe opioid overdose death rate, by then almost entirely fueled by illicit fentanyl, continued to climb. in 2017, fentanyl for the first time became the leading cause of overdose deaths in america.\n\non sept. 1, trump nominated rep. tom marino (r-pa.) to be his first permanent white house drug czar. marino, a former prosecutor, had been one of trump's earliest and most ardent supporters in congress.\n\nbut marino's nomination quickly fell apart. a joint investigation by the post and 60 minutes disclosed that marino had close ties to the opioid industry. the investigation found that the congressman had sponsored legislation that made it harder for the dea to penalize drug distributors and manufacturers when they failed to report suspicious orders and shipments of narcotics.\n\non oct. 17, a little more than a month after his nomination, marino withdrew, creating even more uncertainty within the drug czar's office.\n\namanda busa, 27, jokes with her fiance, jason mitchell, at her daughter's softball game in frankfort, ohio, in april. she is in recovery after years of addiction, which began with pain pills and fentanyl patches. this disease is real, she says. people are dying.\n\na week later, trump mentioned fentanyl publicly for the first time as president; he had been in office for nine months. trump also took christie's advice by declaring the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency — a step obama officials had decided not to take in may 2016, when health policy experts asked for the declaration for fentanyl.\n\nas americans, we cannot allow this to continue, trump said in an oct. 26, 2017, white house speech. it is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. never been this way. we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.\n\nbut two things were missing: money and a detailed plan.\n\nwhen you say this is an emergency, you would expect to hear what they plan to do about the emergency, said andrew kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at brandeis university. when president trump designated the opioid crisis a public health emergency, at the very same time, he should have said, 'here's what we're going to do about it,' and put out a detailed plan outlining what every federal agency was going to do.\n\na top trump official would later testify before congress that the public health declaration was intended to bring awareness.\n\non nov. 1, christie's commission released its final report, with 56 recommendations on the opioid crisis. some drug policy experts criticized the commission for taking too long and repackaging old ideas instead of crafting a new strategy.\n\nthey spent a year reinventing the wheel on opioid policy with things we already knew, said andrew kessler, a policy consultant who specializes in behavioral health. it's all been recommended before.\n\nsome health policy experts said the report, while not groundbreaking, did provide a blueprint for the trump administration to follow.\n\nit called for launching an anti-opioid public relations campaign, providing more funding for drug treatment and continuing to target traffickers. the report also called for access to medicine designed to wean people off opioids and to naloxone, an expensive medication that reverses overdoses.\n\nwhitney millay, second from right, heads into a residential recovery facility in washington court house, the only one for women in fayette county, in april. she says she overdosed 10 times on fentanyl. it was a fine line between oblivion and death, millay says.\n\nchristie said the commission's work was an important start.\n\ni think we have to understand the fact that even the steps that we take today, as aggressive as they are compared to where we were, it's still going to take time to catch up with the problem, christie said. fentanyl deaths going higher are completely predictable because fentanyl is so much stronger and more lethal than street heroin.\n\none of the six members of the commission, former congressman patrick j. kennedy (d-r.i.), a recovering addict, said he was disappointed that trump did not do more to promote the report.\n\nwe just never got the president to really give it the firepower and to elevate it, kennedy said in an interview.\n\nhe also hoped that trump would use the report to press congress for significant funding to fight the opioid epidemic, comparable to the $28 billion the federal government spends each year to fight the hiv/aids epidemic in the united states.\n\nanother member, bertha madras, said she was proud of the work. while she understood the importance of getting buy-in from the federal agencies, she was frustrated by the amount of time it took. the commission had to wait several months for officials to respond to the recommendations before the report could be issued, she said.\n\nin the meanwhile, people are dying, and that's haunted me, said madras, a harvard medical school professor who served in the drug czar's office during the george w. bush administration.\n\nbetween january and april 2018, an additional 10,017 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. amanda gray, 24, a psychology student from manhasset, n.y., was one of them.\n\n'keep the damn drugs out'\n\nbetween january and april 2018, an additional 10,017 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. amanda gray, 24, a psychology student from manhasset, n.y., was one of them.\n\nthe white house drug czar's office was still leaderless when christie's commission issued its report in november 2017. a few weeks later, trump named conway, a former republican party pollster, to be his point person on the opioid epidemic. a highly skilled political operative with no drug policy experience, conway was now in charge of coordinating the government's response to the epidemic.\n\nshe was particularly drawn to the issue after seeing devastated families on the 2016 presidential campaign trail and the toll the epidemic had taken in places like ohio, pennsylvania and new hampshire. she also had attended the public hearings held by christie's commission.\n\nthere was such a sense of urgency to literally stop the bleeding and try to stem the losses that people were feeling, that we worked as hard as we could work, as assiduously and as quickly as we could to get our arms around, 'why now, why this?'  conway said.\n\nthe epidemic was a key issue in important swing states. the journal of the american medical association found a correlation between chronic use of prescription painkillers and regions that supported trump. medicare reimbursements for opioid prescriptions also documented the epidemic's disproportionate impact on areas where trump polled well.\n\ncounties and states with the highest opioid use were often areas carried by the republican candidate, the researchers found. in many areas with high rates of drug overdose, voter turnout in 2016 exceeded that in 2012, with donald trump overwhelmingly favored.\n\nas conway took control of the opioid issue, confusion spread within the drug czar's office and across the government, according to former staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the administration. staffers in the office said they would frequently field calls from other agencies and congressional offices, requesting direction on how to increase funding for treatment or how to launch anti-opioid public education campaigns. they said they had no authority to make decisions on their own, and the queries languished.\n\nconway said their criticism was unfounded.\n\nsome of the career people there, respectfully, should be really excited to finally have an administration who cares enough to try to break the back of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history, conway said.\n\non march 19, 2018, trump and sessions traveled to manchester, n.h., to highlight the fight against opioids. the president told the crowd gathered at manchester community college that congress was working on legislation that would set aside billions to fight the epidemic. he said he planned to increase funding to develop nonaddictive painkillers. he also said he was working to shut down illegal online marketplaces to block fentanyl coming in from china.\n\nwhat he said next overshadowed his other remarks.\n\ndrug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year, trump said. and that's why my department of justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we've ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that i talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. and that penalty is going to be the death penalty.\n\nas he did on the campaign trail, trump then tied the epidemic — and his drug strategy — to immigration at the southern border.\n\nsheriff richard k. jones of butler county, ohio, says too much money is being spent on drug treatment programs and not enough on drug prevention and education. any politician who says we're winning this battle with drugs is telling you a lie, he says.\n\nninety percent of the heroin in america comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the democrats will agree with us, and we'll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out, he said.\n\nbuild that wall! build that wall! build that wall! the audience chanted.\n\ndea officials have said that most of the fentanyl pouring into the united states is coming from china through the u.s. postal service and overnight express services. the majority of mexican heroin and fentanyl is concealed in cars and tractor-trailers that come into the united states through legal ports of entry along the southern border, according to a 2018 dea national drug threat assessment. federal agents say they are also seizing increasing amounts of fentanyl that is coming across the border between the legal ports of entry.\n\nthe day after the manchester speech, sessions directed his prosecutors to pursue the death penalty against major drug traffickers.\n\nas trump was calling for the death penalty, one of the cities that had a high fentanyl overdose death rate was running out of money to purchase naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. in baltimore, fentanyl deaths had risen by nearly 5,000 percent between 2013 and 2017, and the death toll was continuing to climb.\n\nleana wen, the health commissioner in baltimore at the time, had to choose who could receive the lifesaving medicine.\n\nwe are rationing the medication that would save people's lives at the moment that they're overdosing, wen recalled in a recent interview. how is that possible?\n\nin a may 3, 2018, letter to conway, wen pleaded with the trump administration to use its influence to lower the price of naloxone. the brand name of the drug, narcan, cost $75 for two doses. in the previous three years, naloxone had reversed more than 10,000 overdoses in baltimore, wen said.\n\nwe request that the trump administration establish a national program to procure naloxone treatments and supply them to state and local health and law enforcement programs, the letter said.\n\nnothing happened, wen said. we never heard back.\n\nconway said she never saw the letter.\n\nbetween may and august 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which cdc data is available. colton gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from peoria, ariz., was one of them.\n\n'it's all fentanyl now'\n\nbetween may and august 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which cdc data is available. colton gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from peoria, ariz., was one of them.\n\nseveral nights a week, christine birhanzl drives the streets of hamilton, a former paper and steel mill town in southwestern ohio, handing out blankets, food and clothes to addicts.\n\nbirhanzl is a recovering addict herself. she is now a director at sojourner recovery services, a treatment facility in butler county. one man she tried to help was james proffit, 40, who had lived on the streets for years. his path to fentanyl was typical. he started by taking large doses of oxycontin and then turned to heroin, not knowing it had been laced with fentanyl.\n\njames proffit smokes a cigarette at a sojourner recovery services treatment facility in hamilton, ohio, in april. proffit had overdosed four times before seeking treatment and has been in recovery since february.\n\nit's all fentanyl now, proffit said in an interview. the county is flooded with fentanyl.\n\nhe overdosed four times but kept using.\n\nit takes all the pain away, proffit said. you get numb, and you don't feel nothing. that lasts about five hours, and then it starts to wear down, you get cold chills, start cramping up and get sore. and then you have to do it again.\n\nbirhanzl finally succeeded in getting proffit help, but only because he was arrested and faced the prospect of six months in jail. he remembered meeting birhanzl on the street and how she tried to convince him to seek treatment. he asked the judge whether he could get into her program.\n\nchristine was my guardian angel, said proffit, who has been clean since february. she never gave up on me. they turned me around 180 degrees.\n\nmedicaid paid for his stay at sojourner recovery services. ohio was one of the states that expanded medicaid under the aca — also known as obamacare — which covers drug treatment for thousands like proffit.\n\nlast august, four cities sued the administration for undermining the act. the cities — baltimore, chicago, cincinnati and columbus, ohio — accused the administration of actively discouraging enrollment, raising rates and limiting health-care services.\n\nin march, the justice department sided with 20 republican-led states seeking to invalidate the entire act as unconstitutional. trump then said senate gop leaders were writing legislation to repeal and replace the aca. but republicans quickly signaled that they had little appetite for raising an explosive issue just as the 2020 political season was getting underway.\n\nproffit waits in line to take his daily medication at the sojourner treatment facility. he works on an application for the next phase of the drug treatment program. proffit waits in line to take his daily medication at the sojourner treatment facility. he works on an application for the next phase of the drug treatment program.\n\nthat same month, the white house proposed slashing medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which could further undercut drug treatment coverage nationwide.\n\ntrump's assistant secretary for health, adm. brett p. giroir, said if medicaid is cut and the aca is declared unconstitutional, those programs would have to be replaced so tens of thousands would not be left without coverage.\n\nif you did something like eliminated coverage for everyone, that would not certainly be positive, unless it's replaced with something that provided equal or more coverage, said giroir, senior opioid adviser to the secretary of the department of health and human services.\n\nin ohio, fentanyl is ravaging parts of the state and overwhelming the system, sen. rob portman (r-ohio) said in an interview.\n\nwhile the overall drug overdose death toll declined by 21 percent in the state between 2017 and 2018, deaths from fentanyl continue to rise. the senator has sponsored legislation to increase federal funding to help the hardest-hit areas of the country. since 2017, ohio has received $140 million from the federal government, but he said he knows it's not enough.\n\ni'm just trying to fight to keep the funding increasing every year, portman said. i got some pushback from some of my colleagues on the republican side of the issue, saying, 'where's the money coming from?' i said, 'this is a crisis. this is a national emergency.' \n\nin clark county, outside dayton, fentanyl overdoses are fueling large cost overruns for government services — foster care, paramedics and police.\n\nit's very stressful for my deputies. they're seeing more death than they've ever seen, said deborah k. burchett, the sheriff of clark county, which had the sixth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. our biggest problem is, our drug addicts also have mental health problems, and all the hospitals have been closed. they all wind up in the jail.\n\nproffit reads a book about drug recovery in his room at the treatment facility.\n\nhealth-care officials and drug treatment experts in clark county say they are starting to see drug treatment money from washington, but more is needed. ending the aca or cutting medicaid, they said, would be disastrous.\n\ni can't even imagine a world like that, said greta mayer, who runs the mental health & recovery board of clark, greene and madison counties in ohio. all of what we've gained would be lost.\n\ntk tk\n\n'we've got to move quickly'\n\non jan. 2, 2019, the senate confirmed james w. carroll jr. to be trump's first permanent drug czar. a former washington-based counsel to the ford motor co., carroll had served as trump's deputy chief of staff. it had been two years since trump took office.\n\non jan. 2, 2019, the senate confirmed james w. carroll jr. to be trump's first permanent drug czar. a former washington-based counsel to the ford motor co., carroll had served as trump's deputy chief of staff. it had been two years since trump took office.\n\nyou've got the worst drug crisis we've had ever, and it takes you two years to get somebody in the white house who wakes up every day thinking about the problems? said keith humphreys, who served as a drug policy adviser to the george w. bush and obama administrations. that to me is just an astounding dereliction of duty.\n\ncarroll, who had been appointed acting drug czar in february 2018, disputed that characterization and said the administration has taken numerous steps to combat the opioid crisis. he noted that the drug czar's office is only one of several agencies that are trying to battle the epidemic and that he is in close contact with them. despite the repeated attempts by the office of management and budget to slash his budget, carroll said he has the full support of the white house. he also said he has proposed spending an additional $1.3 billion on anti-drug efforts.\n\nthis is a priority for the president, carroll said in an interview.\n\nhe acknowledged that the government needs to spend more money and move faster.\n\ni am fiscally conservative, but i also believe that it's going to require more of a financial investment, spent wisely, to get our arms around this, he said. we've got to move quickly.\n\na man at the entrance of baltimore's penn-north metro station in april snorts fentanyl, according to the man who gave it to him, from a credit card. he was standing a few feet from where members of a nonprofit, bmore power, were handing out free doses of narcan, an opioid reversal medication. the man was asked for his name but did not provide it.\n\nconway agreed and said the administration is making important strides.\n\nshe pointed out that the administration had launched an opioid prevention ad campaign. dogs are being trained to detect fentanyl at ports of entry. congress directed the u.s. postal service to start electronically tracking packages from foreign countries. the cdc has begun improving overdose collection data to provide a clearer picture of what is happening on the ground. the administration has formed an opioid cabinet with representatives from key government agencies, and conway said they secured an additional $6 billion from congress to combat the crisis.\n\ntrump also signed a bipartisan legislative package weeks before the 2018 midterm election that creates, expands and renews programs designed to fight the epidemic.\n\nlast month, the president secured a promise from chinese president xi jinping to ban all variants of fentanyl, although government officials said it is too early to tell whether the chinese government will follow through amid the escalating trade war.\n\nfor rep. elijah e. cummings (d-md.), the fentanyl epidemic has hit home; he has represented baltimore both in the state capital and in washington for the past 36 years. he has introduced legislation that calls for spending $100 billion to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nwhile the fentanyl epidemic has mostly affected white americans, the drug is increasingly claiming more african american lives in cities like washington, philadelphia, st. louis and baltimore. between 2013 and 2017, 1,261 people died from fentanyl overdoses in baltimore, which has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the country. the maryland department of health found that an additional 566 people died in the first nine months of 2018, the most recently available data for the city. that far exceeds the number of homicides committed during the entire year, when 309 people were murdered in baltimore.\n\nat a metro stop in west baltimore recently, down the block from an open-air drug market, members of the nonprofit bmore power handed out free doses of narcan. steve diggs, 47, said he had peddled drugs on the streets of the city for nearly 30 years. now in recovery and working for the group, he and other former drug dealers and users are trying to prevent more deaths, which he said started to soar with the arrival of fentanyl in 2015.\n\nbaltimore's penn-north metro station sits in a section of the city known for heavy trafficking of heroin and fentanyl. baltimore has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the united states, according to cdc data.\n\ni'm just trying to help people on the streets, diggs said. they trust me because i lived the life. i know what they're going through.\n\non march 7, cummings, as the new chairman of the house oversight and reform committee, summoned the white house's newly confirmed drug czar to testify before his panel. he said he was angry it had taken carroll so long to appear.\n\nlast year, i repeatedly asked for mr. carroll to testify before us as the acting director of [the drug czar's office], but he refused, cummings said, listing the times carroll had delayed appearing.\n\ncummings also was furious that the white house had not produced its national drug control strategy to congress. it was two years past the congressionally required deadline. instead of submitting a strategy that normally consisted of more than 100 pages of detailed plans, carroll had given the committee what cummings called a 23-page pamphlet that did not outline specific goals or measurable objectives. at the hearing, triana mcneil, a director of the government accountability office, said the document failed to meet congressional requirements.\n\nthe white house office charged with leading our nation's efforts to combat the drug crisis has been missing in action as deaths continue to mount, cummings said. the white house had no national drug control strategy. none. none. all while tens of thousands of people were dying and the crisis was escalating every day.\n\ncarroll said he was personally committed to fighting the drug crisis, noting that a member of his own family was struggling with addiction.\n\ni want every family to have a success story that i really hope and pray that my family is having, carroll said.\n\ncarroll also promised to provide the panel with a more complete drug strategy with quantifiable metrics. two months later, on may 9, carroll and mcneil returned to the committee. carroll submitted several new documents, which he said met congressional requirements.\n\nmcneil told the panel she had reviewed the documents and asked rhetorically whether the gao could say that the drug czar's office has finally produced the congressionally mandated drug strategy.\n\nnot at this time, she testified.\n\na man huddles in an abandoned garage in a drug-riddled section of baltimore's

— white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, in remarks on abc news's this week, march 31, 2019\n\nmulvaney, defending president trump's revived push to replace the affordable care act, made several inaccurate statements about health care when he made the rounds of the sunday-morning talk shows. but we are going to focus on this one because it involves numbers and allows for a relatively straightforward fact check.\n\nad\n\nmulvaney made a simple comparison: he said more people paid a fine for not having health insurance than people who gained from the aca, a.k.a. obamacare. so how do the numbers stack up?\n\nthe facts\n\nthe white house did not respond to a request for an explanation of mulvaney's math. it's possible that he's simply confused about how many people pay what are known as shared responsibility payments. on cnn's state of the union, he said, there were tens of millions of people who were paying a fine, paying a fee, rather than take obamacare.\n\nad\n\nbut that's wrong. according to most recent internal revenue service data (statistics of income), for 2016, 4.95 million taxpayers made the payment, at an average cost of $732. that's a decline from the year before, when nearly 6.67 million taxpayers made payments at an average cost of $462. the penalty had been increasing, but effective jan. 1, 2019, the tax bill signed by president trump set the penalty at zero. (the mandate has not been eliminated.)\n\nad\n\na letter to congress in 2017 by the then-irs commissioner gave a little more detail about the 2015 payments: the median payment was about $330, and 7 percent were $100 or less. the vast majority — 77 percent — of taxpayers reporting a shared responsibility payment still reported a refund, the letter said. about 8 million taxpayers reported a payment in 2014. so the trend line had been going down.\n\nwhy so few people? that's because many more people qualified for exemptions from paying the fee. in 2015, 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. exemptions are granted for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that an individual has income below a certain threshold and lives in a state that did not expand the eligibility for medicaid. the second-most common exemption is if a citizen lives outside of the united states. people also did not need to pay a penalty if they would have had to pay more than 8.05 percent of their income (in 2015) to obtain health insurance.\n\nad\n\nof course, this reflects tax returns, not people. we cannot assume that 5 million taxpayers represent just 5 million people, so we cannot easily make an apples-to-apples comparison. but let's give it a shot.\n\nad\n\nthe soi data shows that 3.3 percent of tax returns paid a mandate penalty.\n\nin 2016, about 10 million people were enrolled in the obamacare exchanges, according to u.s. government data.\n\nmoreover, in 2010, the aca began requiring all insurers to allow young adults up to age 25 to enroll in a parent's health plan. most analysts generally accept that the number of people who gained insurance because of the provision is 2.3 million.\n\n(this is a frozen in time number that dates from 2013, indicating the increase in young adults with insurance before the rest of obamacare kicked in. the number of people without insurance in ages 19-25 has declined significantly since 2010, from 33.9 percent to 14.8 percent in 2018. but much of that improvement stems from other factors related to the law, not the provision that allows young adults to stay on parents' plans. the 2.3 million estimate, as we have noted in the past, is not universally accepted. a 2014 article in the new england journal of medicine calculated a figure of 1 million.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe 10 million on obamacare and 2.3 million young adults add up to 3.8 percent of the u.s. population in 2016, or more than the 3.3 percent represented in the tax returns that made payments. (we will ignore the fact that the 15 percent of the population is over 65 and in theory would be on medicare, and thus don't need health insurance.)\n\nmatthew fiedler, a fellow at the brookings institution who suggested this approach, said that this comparison was probably too generous to mulvaney for several reasons.\n\nnot all people file tax returns, so the denominator for the 3.3 percent is too small, he said. not every person on a tax return on which somebody paid the mandate penalty paid the penalty themselves. he added that he suspected the typical tax unit in which somebody paid a mandate penalty is smaller than average, in which case the 3.3 percent of tax returns would correspond to a smaller fraction of the total population.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut mulvaney's assertion really goes off the rails when you consider the impact of the expansion of medicaid, the health program for the poor. he did not mention it, but that was also a key part of the affordable care act. the law offered medicaid to nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of the poverty level, or $27,821 for a family of three in 2016. in kentucky, far more people qualified for health care under medicaid than signed up for obamacare insurance.\n\nthe number of people who gained because of the medicaid expansion is a bit fuzzier and open to interpretation. there are 17.1 million in the expansion group for whom states are getting enhanced federal matching payments, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. there are 12.7 million who were made newly eligible. the reason the numbers are different is because some states had waivers pre-aca that included some of these enrollees.\n\neven taking the lower number would more than double the percentage of the population who gained from obamacare. so it would be 7.7 percent, versus 3.3 percent or fewer making payments.\n\nthe pinocchio test\n\nas a matter of simple math, mulvaney is wrong. far more people — twice as many — gained under the affordable care act than paid a penalty. we're not sure why mulvaney would have such a limited understanding of the impact of the law, but it may have started with his misimpression that tens of millions of people were paying a fine. that's totally off base, too.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe earns four pinocchios.\n\nfour pinocchios\n\nsend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nsign up for the fact checker weekly newsletter\n\nthe fact checker is a verified signatory to the international fact-checking network code of principles
on freedom, buttigieg likes to say, don't let anybody tell you that the other side is the side that's got a handle on freedom. he explains that freedom isn't merely freedom from government taxes, regulation, etc.:\n\nhe might have added that if someone is addicted to drugs and cannot find treatment, or working two jobs but missing their kids' lives, or commuting for hours because housing prices are too high and public transportation is not available, that person is not very free, either.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmoreover, the notion that obamacare, medicare and medicaid restrict freedom is absurd, reminiscent of the pre-new deal argument that abolishing child labor impairs the freedom of employers and children to contract for labor.\n\nthis goes to a serious problem with the brain-dead conservative movement: its failure to recognize that freedom is one value but not necessarily paramount to others, such as preventing cruelty or eradicating racism.\n\nthe center-right niskanen center put it exquisitely: liberty is a vital principle of the open society, but so are community and equality. absolutizing any of these political goods is the essence of ideological thinking, while moderation is a recognition that all of them are important. such a recognition necessarily puts some constraints on the achievement of any of these principles. and to buttigieg's point, even freedom to attain one's ambitions requires other limits on freedom (e.g. taxes to pay for schools).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nfreedom in republicans' description can often be a rationalization for widening inequality and refusing to protect americans from dangers to health and safety. we might be maximizing ivanka trump's and jared kushner's freedom with huge tax cuts, but for the rest of americans, the massive tax cuts for the rich or rollback on workplace safety or proposing to cut funds for the special olympics (how do these people sleep at night?) don't look like freedom.\n\ngetting democrats out of the freedom-vs.-government nonsensical argument would be a great contribution to buttigieg's party and to reasoned debate. it would force republicans to defend their policies on turf they are unfamiliar with: are they helping people or hurting them, advancing a shared common good or reducing us to the law of the jungle?\n\nbuttigieg — like sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) — is comfortable talking about faith in the context of his public views. warren likes to quote matthew 25 ('i was hungry and you gave me food. i was thirsty and you gave me water, i was in prison and you visited me. naked and you clothed me. and as much as you have done it to one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.') buttigieg says, living your faith might also have to do with paying more attention to those most in need and not celebrating those who already have the most wealth and the most power.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncontrast that with the soullessness, selfishness and cruelty of the president and his policies. what faith tells one to demonize the stranger, deny care for the sick, destroy the planet we've been given and snatch children from the arms of their parents? what religion tells us to prefer white immigrants over nonwhites? president trump's policies are not only wrongheaded (e.g. counterproductive) but just plain wrong.\n\nin speaking from a faith-based perspective, buttigieg, warren and others make a powerful point: what's wrong with trumpism — aside from its deceit, its authoritarianism, its rejection of the american creed and its economic illiteracy — is its rank cruelty. trump's actions routinely violate norms of decent behavior, which for many americans are grounded in a faith tradition.
rep. dave brat (r-va.), who drew national notice after complaining that women were in my grill because he was reluctant to hold a town hall meeting, finally relented and came face to face with those women — and plenty others — at a raucous public event tuesday night.\n\n[the women are in my grill no matter where i go, brat says ]\n\nbrat held the meeting in a tiny town in nottoway county, a rural community carried by trump in november. it's about an hour south of where most in brat's district live, but that didn't stop a stream of people from driving into town and filling up the town hall, with hundreds shut out on the sidewalk.\n\nfor a little more than an hour, brat was heckled nonstop as he fielded questions on health care, president trump's policies and the border wall.\n\nhis answers seemed to antagonize most in the crowd of 150, who yelled back at him, at points drowning him out and prompting a few of his supporters to leave early in disgust.\n\npeople attending the town hall meeting with rep. dave brat hold up pieces of paper in an effort to express their views. (timothy c. wright/for the washington post)\n\nsome of the loudest jeers came over republicans' promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act as people held up red cards signaling their discontent.\n\nthe problem is obamacare has just collapsed, said brat, who stood at a podium in the blackstone herb cottage, a restaurant and event space. the crowd shouted in response, no, it has not!\n\nthe town hall came after constituents, many of them organizing online, made daily calls and sent repeated emails to brat's office to demand a public meeting.\n\nparticipants began to line up along main street hours before the doors opened at 6:30 p.m. many held signs referring to brat's recent gaffe, including one that read va 7th district, it's grilling time!\n\n[in suburban md., democratic congressmen find much warmer reception]\n\nanother sign said, this grandmother drove 165 miles to be in your grill, mr. brat and no one paid me to be here! — a nod to a comment brat made to a richmond paper in which he dismissed protesters as paid activists.\n\nseveral people sported stickers on their clothes bearing their zip codes, to demonstrate they lived in brat's congressional district.\n\nbrat speaks answers a question during the town hall meeting. (timothy c. wright/for the washington post)\n\nas he ticked off the names of the counties he has visited in the district, a few in the crowd yelled arizona, a jab at his plans to attend a town hall meeting with rep. paul a. gosar (r-ariz.) in gold canyon, ariz., on thursday. brat had accepted that invitation before agreeing to hold a town hall in virginia, a move that enraged some of his critics.\n\nblackstone mayor billy coleburn acted as an emcee, reading written questions collected from the crowd. asked do you deny climate change? brat said no, the climate changes all the time. his apparent attempt at levity angered the crowd, prompting some to yell answer the question!\n\non four separate occasions, brat awkwardly plugged his book american underdog, which details his election to congress and his fiscal and conservative principles, saying it's an effective sleep aid. the joke fell flat each time.\n\nasked how as a fiscal conservative brat could justify the cost of the wall along the southern border promised by trump — estimated to cost between $15 billion and $25 billion — brat said, the answer is 'easily.' \n\nthen you pay for it! a woman in the audience shot back.\n\n[republicans are facing the ire of the anti-trump movement this week. will it last?]\n\nhe also gave an unpopular answer when asked if he agreed with trump that the administration was running smoothly so far.\n\nthe answer to that is, given the obstruction in d.c., it's remarkable what he has gotten done, he said. the crowd drowned out his answer forcing him to struggle for a moment — the stock market is going like 'zing!' for the first time — before moving on to a question about the second amendment.\n\nmary mullins, a 61-year-old constituent and professor at virginia commonwealth university who lives in chesterfield, stood up and briefly held the floor, demanding that brat give direct answers.\n\nshe prodded him to add some detail to one of his usual lines about his value system. some actual principles please, not this judeo-christian generality, she said.\n\nnicole subryan, 44, a registered nurse from petersburg, which is not in brat's district, kept up a loud running commentary through the town hall and held up a sheet of paper with the word, lie.\n\nshe and others seemed unimpressed with brat's recitation of his grass-roots credentials, which helped him topple house majority leader eric cantor in 2014. cantor was criticized for being aloof and out of touch with his constituents — many of the same accusations now plaguing brat.\n\ni was one of the first to run as an outsider against the establishment and the crony deals on wall street. i think we're going to drain the swamp, he said, invoking one of trump's favorite lines. the comment sent the crowd into an uproar once again.\n\ni want to get the power out of d.c. and wall street and back to main street, brat said. to which a man yelled, wall street's in the cabinet now.\n\nare the words yes and no in your vocabulary? subryan yelled. then she added, you're full of s---!\n\nanother constant heckler was alyssa mitchell, 21, a college student from richmond, which is not in brat's district. at one point she yelled: how about trump! why doesn't he pay his taxes?\n\nagain and again she shouted: you're misinformed!\n\nbrat, who seemed a little startled at the beginning of the evening, said afterward that he didn't mind the constant jeering and that he understood the country's divisions have deepened since the election.\n\ni thought it was going to be worse, he said.
in the senate, minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has finally drawn the line, describing greene's views as loony. but it is too little, too late. the party has been encouraging loony views for years. today we rightly laud sen. mitt romney (r-utah) for his political courage — but it's worth recalling that when he was running for president in 2012, he craved donald trump's endorsement. when romney got it, he gushed, there are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life. later that year, he tacitly endorsed trump's most noxious lie — birtherism — joking that no one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.\n\nthe real big lie at the heart of the modern republican party is about public policy, not conspiracy theories. starting in the 1930s, republicans promised their voters the repeal of fdr's new deal. when the next republican president, dwight d. eisenhower, did nothing of the sort, the modern conservative movement emerged, furiously branding ike a traitor. when lbj enacted the great society, conservatives pledged that once elected, they would tear it all down — and never did. ronald reagan launched his political career by denouncing medicare as a direct path to socialism. if it passed, he warned, [we] are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in america when men were free. of course, as president, reagan left medicare largely intact.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nin the early 1990s, house leader newt gingrich (r-ga.) doubled down on a rhetoric of radicalism and extremism. he promised revolution and described political opponents as the embodiment of evil, who won only because they lied and cheated. e.j. dionne jr. has described the toxic results of this strategy as the politics of disappointment and betrayal.\n\nsen. ted cruz (r-tex.) follows the same strategy today. his 2016 platform included promises to repeal obamacare, abolish the irs and balance the budget — plans that he knew could never get enacted but were just the right red meat for the base. he treats his supporters like cannon fodder, whipping them into hysteria and sending them into battle.\n\nthe party endlessly crowed about repealing and replacing obamacare, only to come to power without a viable plan and then quickly accommodate itself to the reality it had vowed to overturn. this strategy has led millions of republicans to feel cheated and lied to by their leaders, creating an atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion toward anyone who is not utterly extreme. it also feeds the notion that true conservatism fails because of some kind of collusion, treason and betrayal. it is a short and direct line from gingrich to the jan. 6 capitol riot.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nif you are looking for an alternative path for a conservative leader, one who even knows how to appeal to populist and nationalist sentiment, look at british prime minister boris johnson. johnson, who initially bungled covid-19 but is now tackling the pandemic with much greater seriousness, has gradually emerged as the most consequential conservative politician since margaret thatcher. he has been slowly but surely reshaping his party to make it more compatible with modern-day britain. his cabinet is remarkably diverse, with two of the three most powerful positions filled by asian britons.\n\ndescribing his plans for big spending during the pandemic and after, johnson said, it sounds like a new deal and all i can say is that, if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be — because that is what the times demand: a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis. he adds to these innovations more traditional thatcherite ideas such as efficient government, free trade and a moral foreign policy. we will build better and build greener, he said, but we will also build faster — by dispensing with much of the red tape and regulation that burden britain today.\n\nif republicans are searching for a conservatism that can work in the modern era, they should first stop lying to their own voters and look to examples such as britain's to bring their party into the world of facts and reality.\n\nad\n\nad

1. how much of obamacare survived under trump?\n\nmost of it, including tax subsidies to help people afford coverage and, in 39 states (including the district of columbia), expanded eligibility for medicaid, the u.s. health insurance program for low-income americans. key obamacare consumer protections that also remain in place allow children to stay on a parent's policy until age 26, require insurance companies to treat people with preexisting conditions equally and prohibit the imposition of annual or lifetime coverage limits.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. how many americans are covered because of obamacare?\n\nroughly 20 million. about two-thirds of them joined medicaid as a result of the expanded eligibility. the rest found coverage by comparison-shopping among private insurers at government-run online marketplaces, where policies include subsidies for people who make as much as 400% of the federal poverty level. (the expanded version of medicaid enrolls people earning up to 138% of the poverty line.) even with obamacare in place, 28.9 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, two million more than in 2016, according to the kaiser family foundation. the u.s. is an outlier among developed countries by not having universal health coverage.\n\n3. which parts have been eliminated?\n\nad\n\nobamacare originally required all states to participate in the expanded medicaid program; the supreme court, in a 2012 split ruling that upheld most of the law, struck down the requirement. the law as written also required all americans to buy health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate -- at risk of a tax penalty. the trump administration whittled away at obamacare with executive actions, including one that cut funding for so-called navigator programs that help sign people up. a tax overhaul passed by republicans and signed by trump in 2017 eliminated the penalty for noncompliance, rendering the mandate moot and paving the way for the broader constitutional challenge to the law now before the supreme court.\n\nad\n\n4. what is that case about?\n\nrepublican-controlled states say that when congress voided the penalty for not having insurance, all of obamacare was rendered unconstitutional. the trump administration sided with those states. the supreme court heard arguments shortly after trump's third court nominee, amy coney barrett, took her seat as an associate justice. while republicans were banking on the court's 6-3 conservative majority, chief justice john roberts and associate justice brett kavanaugh signaled during the november oral arguments they are inclined to uphold the bulk of the law even if individual mandate is struck down. a ruling is likely by june.\n\nad\n\n5. what happens if obamacare is struck down?\n\nif the ruling were to be put into effect immediately, it would rescind coverage for millions of americans as well as undo consumer protections and regulations that have reshaped the business models for insurers, drug companies, hospitals and doctors, all during a pandemic that's prompted 485,000 americans to sign up for obamacare after losing health-care coverage from their employer. the court, as part of any ruling against obamacare, could also issue a stay to give the biden administration a chance to respond. or congress, now in democratic hands by the slimmest margin, could try to forestall the ruling by restoring a nominal tax for the mandate, or passing a law specifying that the loss of the mandate should not bring down the rest of the law.\n\nad\n\n6. if obamacare survives, what does biden want to do with it?\n\nad\n\nhe campaigned on a pledge to expand the program by offering a government-provided alternative to private insurance that's known as a public option, a proposal he's called bidencare. it would be available to all americans, including those who get their insurance through work. low-income americans would be automatically enrolled and, if eligible, their premiums would be free. biden's plan also envisions expanding obamacare tax credits to try making premiums more affordable for middle-income households. his plan set him apart from the progressive wing of the democratic party, which has pushed the idea of achieving universal coverage by scrapping private insurance and replacing it with medicare for all.\n\n7. what has biden done already?\n\nad\n\nan executive order he issued will create a special enrollment period for plans sold in the federal healthcare.gov market from feb. 15 to may 15, offering a path to health care for people who find themselves without insurance coverage after losing their jobs. the order also directs agencies to look for ways to strengthen medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people, and obamacare more broadly. he could also take other administrative actions, like restoring funding for navigators and reversing trump administration guidance letting states waive certain obamacare rules.\n\nad\n\n8. is obamacare viable for the long term in its current state?\n\nsome economists worry about a death spiral of rising costs in the absence of a mechanism, like the individual mandate, that forces healthy americans to get covered, since healthier people buying coverage keeps costs down for sick people. that's one issue. another is the limited coverage options available to americans in rural and remote parts of the country. and in the mostly republican-led states where elected leaders have declined to expand medicaid eligibility, many residents fall in a coverage gap, earning just enough income that they don't qualify for subsidies.\n\nad\n\n9. do americans want obamacare to stay or go?\n\nad\n\nu.s. public opinion of the law was mostly negative from its passage in march 2010 until trump became president and sought to repeal it, according to tracking surveys by the kaiser family foundation. the threat of elimination – which failed when the late senator john mccain of arizona gave a memorable thumbs down in an early morning vote -- put a spotlight on popular provisions of the law, notably its prohibition on insurers charging sick people more for coverage and its list of essential health benefits, like hospitalization and maternity care, that must be covered. kaiser's tracking survey found in october that 55% of americans viewed the law favorably, while 37% viewed it unfavorably.\n\nfor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
the states didn't trust one another, not least because many of them had little in common culturally, ethnographically or politically. new englanders' puritan ancestors had devised their institutions to prevent their greatest fear: the formation of an aristocracy. yet the chesapeake country was run by a landed, slaveholding gentry, complete with english-style manor homes with names like monticello and mount vernon. how would they ever agree on the contours of a shared central government?\n\njames madison's solution was federalism, a division of power between the federal and state governments, including outsize influence for sparsely populated states — which would have as many senators as the most populous ones and disproportionate sway in the electoral college, which selected the president. together, these two branches populated the federal bench and the supreme court, further amplifying small states' influence.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntoday, federalism, the bargain that made the united states possible, is threatening to tear it apart. donald trump is president despite losing the popular vote and remains in office because of the unequivocal support of a group of senators representing a minority of the federation's population. the same senate majority denied the last president a supreme court pick, ensuring a lasting conservative lock on the highest court in a country where conservatives are not a majority. demographic trends will make this counter-majoritarian balance of power worse with each passing year, creating a crisis of democratic legitimacy in a country that once saw itself as the world's model democracy.\n\nif ever there was a time to reexamine madison's invention, this would seem to be it.\n\nuniversity of texas professor donald f. kettl takes up this task in his new book, the divided states of america. he seeks to show how we got to this impasse and presents an argument for how federalism itself could be the instrument of our salvation. kettl offers a clear and cogent exposition of the problem, but his answer to it, a hamiltonian solution to madison's great dilemma, is little developed.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nkettl aptly describes why federalism was unavoidable when the constitution was written in 1787. many states did not agree with the draft mission statement for the united states that thomas jefferson had laid out in the preamble to the declaration of independence. liberty and self-government might have passed muster if properly defined, but the assertion that all men are created equal, with inherent rights, would be mocked by generations of southern slaveholders. representatives from south carolina and georgia refused to support the declaration until a passage condemning the slave trade as cruel war against human nature itself was removed.\n\nequality has remained a flash point for inter-state conflict, a story kettl traces through the constitutional convention, the civil war, the adoption (and decades-long judicial annulment) of the 14th amendment and its equal-protection clause, and virtually every big domestic policy battle throughout american history. federalism's balance of power has shifted back and forth, he observes, with inequality increasing whenever the federal government has taken a hands-off approach.\n\ninequality is at the root of america's existential crisis, kettl argues, and not only because it is higher here than in any of the world's other leading industrialized nations. income inequality among the states is growing, too, creating more polarization and more friction and rendering the united states a collection of states divided. with washington deadlocked, the states continue to go their own way in everything from infrastructure investments to obamacare implementation. their policy differences are increasingly driving the country apart.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nconsider the contrasts. mississippi has a poverty rate triple that of new hampshire. income inequality, measured as the ratio of the top 1 percent of earners to the other 99 percent, is more than three times higher in new york, connecticut and wyoming than in iowa, alaska and hawaii. mississippi's infant mortality rate is twice that of massachusetts, and its life expectancy is nearly seven years lower than hawaii's. the united states is now a nation where the government that citizens get depends increasingly on where they live, kettl laments.\n\nresearch shows that inequality breeds distrust in government, kettl notes, which decreases electoral participation and compliance with tax collection while increasing political polarization and corruption. it is expensive, since more distrust leads to more regulation and litigation, he writes. combined with the erosion of madison's other great invention, the separation of powers, the republic has created a crisis it may well not be able to survive.\n\nkettl demonstrates that federalism has always been a dynamic experience, with fuzzy and shifting lines between federal and state powers. key supreme court decisions — mcculloch v. maryland (1819), plessy v. ferguson (1896), brown v. board of education (1954) — have shifted the relative powers forward, back and forward again. federal grants, an early-19th-century innovation that lured states to become agents of national policy through offers too good to refuse, had an enormous impact, allowing federal powers to build interstates, set public school standards and insure the poor.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nsuch grants are central to kettl's solution, which draws inspiration from the writings of alexander hamilton, who championed a strong central government because he was skeptical that the states could ever give the country the direction it needed. kettl's advice is to transform the grants' role by focusing them primarily on inequality-busting initiatives to redistribute wealth from rich to poor, and social benefits to the very young and very old from the rest of us. as part of this effort, washington would take a stronger hand in how medicaid is administered by the states and in encouraging the states to adopt policy innovations successfully tested by their counterparts.\n\nthese lightly sketched solutions may strike many readers as small bore, given the challenges facing the country, and perhaps more cautious than hamilton himself would recommend. so too is kettl's analysis that the core of the problem is what he calls the rise of light-fare television, which he says has undermined federalism by encouraging snappy national fixes to complex, context-dependent problems.\n\nbut while kettl's solutions may not be convincing, his diagnosis of some of the pathologies undermining the republic is, and the historical background he provides on the evolution of madison's nation-founding invention will be useful to anyone seeking to flesh out additional remedies.\n\nthe divided states of america\n\nwhy federalism doesn't work\n\ndonald f. kettl
keep in mind these numbers reflect where he is when the economy is strong, when the special counsel report has not been released, when congressional and southern district of new york prosecutors are still combing through his finances, and when hope exists of a face-saving deal with china that would avoid escalation of the trade war. if all or some of those turn out badly, things could really get ugly.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ndemocrats would be foolish to think, however, there is no way for them to lose. first, if trump makes the election a choice between himself and a far-left candidate, instead of a referendum on his presidency, he may well survive. second, if the economy is humming along, voters can decide a good economy outweighs all the things they dislike about him. a good economy is the most valuable asset an incumbent president can have.\n\ndemocrats have two tasks. first, avoid picking an obvious target for trump to shred, either someone far to the left or someone who seems shaky, uncertain, equivocating or weak. he's got his socialist tag ready for the first category. with regard to the second concern — gravitas, strength, leadership abilities — democrats should consider how their nominee will stand up to trump. does he or she have the focus, humor and self-discipline to avoid being dragged down to his level, and does the nominee know where he or she wants to take the country. trump's simplistic nostalgia is wrong and misguided, but it is comprehensible. to project strength, the democrat is going to have to be able to punch through the trumpian noise and make the case that voters are at risk if trump gets reelected.\n\nthe last consideration — casting trump not as their protector but as a menace — will be key. telling voters he's an awful person may be totally ineffective; they know that already. telling them that he's going after their medicare and obamacare, hurting farmers with a tariff war, making the gap between rich and poor worse, and endangering the planet for them and their children by willful ignorance over climate change is quite another. the more concrete and immediate the threat (e.g., extreme weather, loss of health-care coverage), the more impact the message may have.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ncertainly democrats should talk about how trump has undermined national unity, civility and stature in the world, but democrats should also pay attention to what voters are saying. they hate the chaos, the tweets, the constant turmoil. perhaps let america be sane may be the most effective thing a democrat has to offer. hence, they better pick someone calm, authoritative, reliable and drama-free.
will the presidency be effectively persuasive when wielded by a president who's widely viewed as dishonest?\n\nabc's jonathan karl raised that point with vice president pence in an interview that aired tuesday morning.\n\nhow can the president be — how can his word be trusted on this when he's said so many things that are just not true about this crisis? karl asked, pointing to several recent examples of trump and his team misleading the public. how can the american people trust the president when he says this is a crisis when he says things over and over again that aren't true?\n\nad\n\nad\n\npence's response was not robust.\n\nwell, look, the american people aren't as concerned about the political debate as they are concerned about what's really happening at the border, he said.\n\nthis is credibility, karl replied. the white house said nearly 4,000 terrorists come into our country. that's not true.\n\nand, with that, pence happily engaged in a debate over that specific number instead of addressing karl's larger point.\n\nsince even before his election, trump has been viewed as dishonest by the american public according to quinnipiac university polling. the lowest percentage of poll respondents to say that trump was not honest came in november 2016, shortly after trump won the presidency and during the brief stretch that constituted his honeymoon period.\n\nthat 52 percent who said trump wasn't honest actually matched the highest percentage ever to say that about barack obama, which happened in 2013, after the botched rollout of the obamacare website.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthat was a low point for obama that contributed to a distrust in the executive branch during his presidency, according to polling from gallup. that data is available back to the second term of bill clinton's administration and shows a pattern: clinton, george w. bush and obama all enjoyed general confidence in the executive branch that trump hasn't seen.\n\neven during his impeachment, clinton's white house was viewed as much more trustworthy than trump's ever was. bush's white house held a lot of trust and confidence from americans that evaporated following then-secretary of state colin powell's presentation to the united nations about the risk posed by iraq — an incorrect argument, as it turned out — and the war in that country that followed.\n\nbush deployed powell to spend some of the capital that he'd earned as president, including through his navigation of the aftermath of 9/11. bush gave his own oval office address a month after powell's u.n. appearance hoping to convey the seriousness and deliberateness of his decision to invade iraq. it was an attempt, in part, to use the white house as a character witness to his argument.\n\nby giving an address from the oval office, trump is doing something similar: asking america to trust him because he is the president. but the presidency is viewed as untrustworthy at least in part because trump holds the position. even trump's vice president can't argue that trump is viewed as untrustworthy, instead trying to argue, bizarrely, that concerns about the factual accuracy of trump's statements fall into a nebulous category of political debate and therefore not something that americans care about.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe passion you hear from president trump, his determination to take this case to the american people as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the oval office, comes from his deep desire to do his job to protect the american people, pence told karl later in the interview — after reiterating the debunked statistic about terrorists trying to enter the united states that karl himself presented as an example of trump's misleading rhetoric. [w]e're going to continue to carry that case forward until the democrats in congress come to the table and start negotiating not just to end the government shutdown but to end what is an undeniable crisis at our southern border.\n\nin other words, the administration, unchastened, stands by and will continue to stand by trump's inaccuracies if they're in service to trump's policy goals.\n\nsome americans will certainly assume that if trump is leveraging the heft of an oval office address, it is in service of something that deserves that attention, this undeniable crisis in pence's formulation (that became urgent only after trump changed his mind about agreeing to a funding deal when he saw conservative media expressing frustration about his not picking a fight over the border wall). it's worth remembering, though, that trump has a long track record of making false claims to try to get what he wants.
by the president's accounting, his accomplishments are legion. he boasts about his tax cuts — the biggest in history. he preens about his judges — a historic transformation of the judiciary — chosen to cater to the anti-choice passions of evangelical christians. he brags about slashing regulations. he says his wall is being built. he promises once more to trash obamacare and provide a much better alternative. he claims to still be avoiding endless wars. he champions his trade deals and his tariffs. and, of course, he takes — and gets — credit for the growing economy with low top-line unemployment.\n\nthe truth is different. deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide — deaths of despair — hit a new high in 2017. his assaults on obamacare have left 2 million more americans without health coverage, while he's never come close to presenting a comprehensive alternative that would, in fact, meet his promise to provide insurance for everybody.\n\nad\n\nad\n\non the economy, the number of good jobs in manufacturing has gone from boom to bust. inequality reached new extremes, as trump's appointed swamp of lobbyists, ceos and operatives worm their way into the federal bureaucracy and create more corruption, rigged rules and rip-offs. his tax cut didn't produce the $4,000 pay boost he promised; rather it lined the pockets of the rich and the corporations. chief executives used the corporate breaks mostly to buy back stock in an effort to please stockholders and boost the value of their stock options. and while his wall is arousing anger among homeowners whose properties are being requisitioned, he failed even to propose the rebuilding of america's decrepit infrastructure that he promised.\n\nhis trade tariffs and deals certainly challenged the lousy deals of the past, but the result to date contributed to what the federal reserve calls a technical recession in the manufacturing sector and increasing economic strain on small farmers. no wonder bankruptcies and suicides are rising among small farmers. and while the white house trumpeted aid to farmers, the environmental working group reports that the top 10 percent of farms — the largest and most profitable, industrial scale farms in the country — received 50 percent of the money. the bottom 80 percent received an average of $5,136.\n\noverseas, as tehran's restraint saves the president from stumbling into a war with iran, he's dispatching 3,500 more troops to the middle east — on top of the thousands he already sent as the war in afghanistan continues. u.s. soldiers remain at risk in senseless deployments from syria to iraq, with the latter country's parliament voting to ask our troops to leave. even fox news loyalists such as tucker carlson are chafing at trump's betrayal of his promises.\n\nad\n\nad\n\npolls show trump's approval ratings are recovering from the impeachment inquiry. trump's republican support is solid even as other americans are repulsed by his crimes and outrages — from using public office for personal gain, to locking up kids in cages on the border, to cynically exacerbating america's racial tensions, to the denial of the greatest threat to our security: catastrophic climate change.\n\nfor trump's people — the working-class voters who backed a bumptious billionaire who they hoped would shake up things as their champion — the betrayal is clear and specific. many of these americans voted for trump in 2016 despite thinking he was unfit for office. they knew he was a scoundrel, but they hoped he would be their scoundrel. as he nears the end of his first term, it is increasingly clear that they voted for a con man without realizing they were the mark.
donald trump has promised not only to be the voice of the american people, but also to take decisive, immediate action. as president, he has said he would move fast to destroy the islamic state, scrap bad trade deals, build that wall, stop the gangs and the violence, and stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. he would immediately suspend immigration from countries where terrorism is rampant. he might even defy treaty obligations and decline to aid nato allies.\n\nthe republican nominee has led some to conclude that he intends a sweeping expansion of presidential authority. his rhetoric implies a muscular, almost unitary, presidency that would be at least as expansive as what historian arthur schlesinger jr. famously dubbed the imperial presidency — his critique of richard nixon's abuse of power in the era of watergate and vietnam.\n\nbut scholars of the presidency say that barack obama, george w. bush and their predecessors have added so many powers to the white house toolbox that a president trump could fulfill many of his promises legally — and virtually unchecked by a congress that has proven incapable of mustering much pushback for decades .\n\nevery president expands the power of the presidency, said neal devins, a law professor at the college of william & mary. this is a constant pattern. they never shrink the presidency. a president trump could say 'i'm going to use the obama playbook' and go pretty far. the difference between hillary clinton and donald trump is not going to be one of lawlessness, but of the policies they pursue.\n\nplenty of politicians have pledged wholesale, game-changing shifts in policy, but trump's hot rhetoric stands out because his promises are rarely accompanied by details on how he might implement his initiatives. he doesn't say how he might punish companies that ship jobs overseas, or how he'd get mexico to pay for a border wall, or how he would impose a ban on muslims entering the country. he says he will make it happen, believe me.\n\ntrump's critics hear his sweeping promises as the words of a classic strongman, a ruler who seems prepared to push aside the cobwebs of bureaucracy and the checks and balances of american federalism to produce instant, decisive action. they've compared him to mussolini, hitler, vladi­mir putin, saddam hussein and argentina's juan peron. trump has praised putin and hussein for being tough on terrorism. in the past, trump has singled out china's crackdown against pro-democracy activists in tiananmen square in 1989 as a demonstration of the power of strength.\n\ncertainly rhetorically, trump's idea that 'i alone can fix this' does go beyond the template that president obama and president bush before him came in with, the idea that you try to fix things together, said andrew rudalevige, a professor of government at bowdoin college.\n\ntrump's defenders argue that his statements, whether off the cuff at rallies or in his scripted acceptance address at last week's republican convention, are not policy prescriptions but rather reflections of popular frustration. when trump says he's going to fix a problem immediately, some supporters say, he's throwing down his marker, taking a stand rather than spelling out a plan.\n\na spokesman for trump declined to comment for this article.\n\nsome trump initiatives, such as repealing obamacare, cutting taxes or expanding social security, would require extensive, close work with congress. but presidents already have the power to do much of what trump has proposed. congress has given the president the authority to make trade deals, for example, and trump could try to renegotiate the nuclear deal with iran.\n\nother promises put him in disputed terrain, such as his vow to bomb isis, circle their territory and take the oil. some argue that such actions must be authorized by congress under the war powers resolution, which was passed over president nixon's veto in 1973. but presidents since then have routinely ordered military action without seeking a congressional green light.\n\ntrump could justify an all-out assault on isis by pointing to the same kinds of authority that allowed the bush administration to use torture against alleged terrorists and allowed the obama administration to expand the use of drones to kill terrorist suspects. recent presidents have used their constitutional authority as commander in chief even to take actions that are specifically restricted by law.\n\nin 2014, obama announced a prisoner swap in which army sgt. bowe bergdahl was brought home from afghanistan in exchange for five taliban commanders who had been held at the u.s. facility at guantanamo bay, cuba. congress had passed a law requiring the president to notify it 30 days before the release of any guantanamo detainee, but obama insisted he had a higher duty to protect american lives and u.s. soldiers.\n\nthe presidential toolbox of unilateralism is quite deep, rudalevige said, but you can't have an imperial presidency without an invisible congress that is willing to take a back seat because it doesn't want to be blamed for a war or some other unpopular policy.\n\nthere's only one effective way to push back against presidential power grabs, he concluded in a recent study: congress has to do its job.\n\nthat hasn't been happening, however. the country is so politically polarized that many members of congress are now elected on a promise to resist the kind of compromise that is necessary to build majorities and be an effective check on executive power .\n\nthe constitutional order set up by our founders is breaking down, sen. mike lee (r-utah) wrote this month in national review. what congress wants today is to be weak... for fear of the political consequences of hard choices.\n\nlee argued that presidents will continue to assume broader powers unless congress fulfills its constitutional duty to protect the american people from exactly the kind of arbitrary, unaccountable government-without-consent that congress now for its own selfish reasons enables the executive branch to practice.\n\nin recent decades, presidents have stretched their ability to act unilaterally, bypassing congress through executive orders, executive memos, national security orders, findings, signing statements and prosecutorial discretion. after vietnam and watergate, congress pushed back with a series of laws designed to rein in the president.\n\nbut the war powers resolution, the intelligence oversight act, the congressional budget act and the independent counsel act — all designed to limit presidential unilateralism — have proved toothless, and congress has since ceded even more authority.\n\nafter 9/11, the rush to expand the president's ability to respond quickly to attacks and to ferret out terrorists shifted the balance of power ever more decisively toward the white house. then-vice president dick cheney, a proponent of a stronger presidency going back to his days in congress three decades earlier, argued that the fragility of a world with nuclear weapons mandated an expansive presidency: the fact that the president is accompanied at all times by a military aide carrying the nuclear codes, he said, means that he doesn't have to check with anybody. he doesn't have to call the congress. he doesn't have to check with the courts. he has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in.\n\na president who might act unilaterally was one of the chief fears expressed in the original debates about the constitution. writing in the federalist papers in 1787, the pseudonymous cato warned against the presidency becoming a caesar, caligula, nero, and domitian in america. the system of checks and balances — giving congress the authority to make laws and decide how money is spent, and giving the supreme court the last word on what laws comport with the constitution — was supposed to rein in the president.\n\nbut as the size and scope of government ballooned, the president became the de facto manager of a sprawling, vital sector of the economy, and presidential authority expanded almost continuously. a century ago, theodore roosevelt argued that presidents were allowed to do anything not specifically prohibited by law or the constitution. and nixon famously asserted, after he had resigned from office over the watergate scandal, that when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\n\nby 2004, george w. bush could state that when congress wouldn't act, he had no choice but to issue an executive order expanding access to federal grants for faith-based charities. obama similarly said in 2014 that when congress doesn't move on things they should move on,... i've got a pen and i've got a phone, and i can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.\n\nin today's hyperpartisan politics, accusations of overly expansive presidencies fly across the aisle as a matter of course. a strong presidency is one who is of your own party and an imperial presidency is one from the other side, rudalevige said.\n\npotentially dangerous clashes could develop: if trump were to ask the military to target terrorists' families — an idea he has at various times proposed and disavowed — some military and intelligence officials have said that commanders might refuse to follow such orders.\n\nthe american armed forces would refuse to act, former cia director michael hayden said earlier this year. you are required not to follow an unlawful order.\n\nthat scenario could lead to a constitutional crisis, rudalevige said, especially if we still have an eight-member supreme court, assuming that the late justice antonin scalia's seat remained unfilled.\n\nif a president does overstep his authority, congress could cut off his funding or impeach him, but a president trump could counter with the power of the bully pulpit.\n\nany new president comes in with a certain degree of goodwill and political capital, said joe hagin, who spent 14 years as a white house aide in republican administrations, culminating in eight years as deputy chief of staff to george w. bush. what's happening in the nation and the world at any given time affects your ability to move quickly. and if you look at what we were able to do post 9/11, it's almost unprecedented.\n\ncongress acted within weeks to authorize war, pass the patriot act and establish the department of homeland security — a sharp contrast to the administration's failure to move on domestic initiatives such as overhauling social security and reforming immigration. what made the difference, hagin said, was public opinion, and trump's knack for blunt communication could be an effective defense against efforts by congress to rein him in.\n\nhe's thrown the rulebook out the window, and that could be a very good thing, hagin said. he certainly understands how to communicate with a certain segment of the population, and the question is, can he expand that to a majority of the population?\n\npublic opinion also would likely have a big impact on congress's willingness to push back.\n\nno one knows what trump would really do, which is why people are so freaked out, devins, the law professor , said. if he did push the boundaries dangerously, it really would depend on congress, and it would take an awful lot for republicans to join with the democrats to assert themselves and slap him down.\n\nit took watergate for the parties to stand up to nixon and attempt to constrain the presidency. the question really is, what unilateral action against isis would be so extreme that congress would pass a funding ban?\n\nasked about trump's proposals to ban muslims or build a border wall without congressional approval, house speaker paul ryan (r-wisc.) said last month that he would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers.\n\nbut devins has concluded that the record of the past two decades shows that congress lacks both the will and the way to check the presidency.\n\ntoday's system of checks and balances, he said , is an abject failure.\n\nmike debonis contributed to this report.
actually, the system will work just fine — as it is supposed to under the constitution — if a democratic majority takes its oversight responsibilities seriously, in contrast to the gop-controlled house, which hasn't lifted a finger to stop president trump's conflicts of interest or his unconstitutional receipt of foreign emoluments, nor to demand that he disclose his tax returns (which every modern president has done). house republicans have not issued a single subpoena to investigate a plethora of financial concerns involving environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt, and they have not called on secretaries of treasury, interior or housing and urban development to testify under oath about their abuses of taxpayer funds.\n\nthe house intelligence committee ran a mickey mouse investigation of the russia matter that failed to called dozens of relevant witnesses and did not look for collusion, thereby allowing it to claim there was no collusion. ryan sat silently as republican committee members cooked up a misleading memo and conducted a smear campaign against the fbi. the speaker also objected to a select committee or an independent commission on russian interference in our election, and will not consider legislation to protect special counsel robert s. mueller iii or deputy attorney general rod j. rosenstein.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nryan refused to take up a resolution condemning the president's equating of neo-nazis with those protesting neo-nazis. he proclaimed, i think that would be — that would be so counterproductive. if we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country? well, if republicans didn't oppose it then . . . never mind.\n\nin short, ryan has neglected his oath of office and has failed to fulfill his obligation to check the actions of the executive branch. by doing so, he has enabled and emboldened the most lawless and corrupt presidency since richard nixon.\n\nit is precisely because we need a party willing to exercise its oversight responsibilities, including the subpoena power, that ending republicans' majority is a critical corrective action to restore democratic norms. ryan has it backwards: the system — of constitutional government and checks and balances — is currently shut down thanks to republicans, who time and again have put party before country.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nryan also shed crocodile tears over the prospect of gridlock if democrats take the majority. really? since trump took office, what are his accomplishments other than an unpopular tax plan (see above)? did he push through a new health-care plan to replace the affordable care act? forge a deal to protect beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program? garner support for major infrastructure project? no, no and no. (he did push through a budget that exploded the debt, however.)\n\nto the contrary, time and again, ryan has been an impediment to bipartisan dealmaking, most clearly in refusing to bring a daca fix to the floor. maybe gridlock will occur if democrats take control after november's midterm elections, but they could hardly be less productive than the gop-controlled house. moreover, left to their own devices, it is certainly possible that chuck and nancy [house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.)] could make deals with trump on daca, infrastructure and even on shoring up the obamacare exchanges. the greatest obstacle to bipartisan legislation is the freedom caucus, which ryan allows to run amok.
as dan balz explained this morning: there is no benign explanation.… it is either a deliberate attempt to undermine faith in the democratic process, an exhortation to those who favor new restrictions on access to the ballot box or the worrisome trait of someone with immense power willing to make wild statements without any credible evidence. by repeating as president what he had said as a candidate, for whatever purpose, trump is now striking at the foundation of a democratic society. this is yet another example of trump being willing to cast doubt on information, individuals or institutions that he believes threaten his legitimacy, challenge his authority or question his actions.... this is not a debate about the size of the crowd at last week's presidential inauguration. that is a piddling controversy compared to his claim that the election system overseen by the states is somehow riddled with fraud. trump prefers his own reality, even if that damages the very system of government atop which he now sits.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n-- while trump's claims of voter fraud are certainly newsworthy, they are also a distraction from an aggressive effort by this new white house to quickly transform the government and dramatically change the direction of public policy in ways that will directly impact tens of millions of americans.\n\nas john mitchell famously said when he became richard nixon's attorney general, watch what we do, not what we say.\n\nthat maxim is truer now more than ever.\n\nwe've all been drinking from a fire hose since noon last friday. to help you not lose track, here are 11 moves by team trump that would lead the news in any ordinary time but have gotten relatively little public attention:\n\n1. moving to lift the ban on cia black sites\n\nad\n\nthe trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the central intelligence agency to reopen overseas 'black site' prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former president obama shut them down, the new york times's charlie savage reports. president trump's three-page draft order, titled 'detention and interrogation of enemy combatants' … would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that mr. obama put in place in response to policies of the bush administration. if mr. trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke mr. obama's directive to give the international committee of the red cross access to all wartime detainees in american custody — another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the geneva conventions….\n\nthe draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of c.i.a. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now barred by statute, charlie notes. but it sets up high-level policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to mr. trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a 'hell of a lot worse' — not only because 'torture works,' but because even 'if it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway.'\n\n2. muzzling agencies:\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president's agenda, juliet eilperin and brady dennis report. the environmental protection agency as well as the agriculture and interior departments now have formal policies restricting what they should convey to the public about their work. … many new administrations — including former president barack obama's — have moved quickly to take control of the u.s. government's public relations machinery and centralize decision-making upon taking office. but the sweeping nature of some of the new controls is unusual.\n\nat the epa , communications staff received a memo instructing them that no social media will be going out and a digital strategist will be coming on board to oversee it. it added, incoming media requests will carefully screened.\n\nthe interior department reactivated its official twitter accounts after an abrupt shutdown that followed the national park service account retweeting two items viewed as unsympathetic to the new president. one referred to the size of the inauguration crowd on the mall, while another addressed policies that were excised from the white house website after trump's swearing in.\n\nthe national institutes of health issued an email to its institute and center directors informing them they should not communicate on public forums and with public officials on new or pending regulation, policy or guidance that is under review.\n\nagriculture department, a slew of officials received a memo instructing them to clear any media communications with the secretary's office. employees of the agency's scientific arm, the agriculture research service, were ordered in a separate memo to cease publication of outward facing documents and news releases. ( at the, a slew of officials received a memo instructing them to clear any media communications with the secretary's office. employees of the agency's scientific arm, the agriculture research service, were ordered in a separate memo to cease publication of outward facing documents and news releases. ( jose a. delreal\n\nanti-pipeline protesters rallied outside the white house on jan. 24, after president trump signed executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines. many activists traveled to washington, d.c., from standing rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the dakota access pipeline. (zoeann murphy/the washington post)\n\n3. an assault on climate science:\n\nit's not surprising that trump followed through on promises to issue executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines, but the administration is making a much harder play below the radar to eviscerate obama's environmental legacy.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nit has instructed epa officials to freeze all grants and contracts, a move that could affect everything from state-led climate research to localized efforts to improve air and water quality to environmental justice projects aimed at helping poor communities. each year the epa awards more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements. for now, it appears, that funding is on hold, casting a cloud of uncertainty over one of the agency's core functions, as well as over the scientists, state and local officials, universities and native american tribes that often benefit from the grants, brady and juliet report.\n\nlast friday, the trump team deleted any reference to global warming on the white house web site. now they're going much further. the white house has ordered the epa to remove the climate change page from its own website, which contains links to scientific global warming research and detailed data on emissions, reuters reports. the page could go dark as early as today. if the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear, one epa staffer said, adding that some employees were scrambling overnight to download the information on personal devices so it cannot be deleted.\n\nwith little warning and no explanation, the centers for disease control and prevention canceled a major climate change conference that had been scheduled for next month in atlanta. the climate and health summit, which had been in the works for months, was intended as a chance for public health officials around the country to learn more about the mounting evidence of the risks to human health posed by the changing climate, brady notes.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe new president even hinted yesterday that he'll soon try to roll back fuel economy standards. he told ceos of the largest automakers during a meeting yesterday that environmental regulations are out of control and said he will curtail the unnecessary ones to encourage more manufacturing in the u.s. (steven overly has more.)\n\nseveral scientists are now trying to organize another march on washington, akin to last weekend's women's march, to raise awareness about what they see as trump's hostility to science. (sarah kaplan is tracking it.)\n\n4. blocking regulations, including one to prevent plane crashes:\n\nwhite house chief of staff reince priebus issued an order friday night to freeze all regulations that haven't yet been formally published in the federal register. politico's josh gerstein reports that at least 62 new regs have already been withdrawn, and the number could go far higher: some of the matters are weighty, like planned cancellation of sanctions against burma (now on hold) or rules to give military spouses preferences in federal hiring. some have already drawn public attention, like a delay in new rules about mistreatment of horses. other actions suspended by the white house move seem less than earth-shattering, like the planned campground fee for public land in richland county, north dakota. however, at least a few of the halts seem troubling, like the withdrawal of a rule about inspecting aircraft fuselages for cracks. the department of housing and urban development also pulled new rules to streamline income tests for federally subsidized housing.\n\nwatch the key moments from rep. mick mulvaney's (r-s.c.) senate confirmation hearing. (erin patrick o'connor, victoria walker/the washington post)\n\n5. keeping the door open to entitlement cuts:\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump's nominee to lead the office of management and budget, rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), defended his support for cuts to popular entitlement programs that trump vowed to keep intact during the campaign. from ylan q. mui: in appearances before the senate budget and homeland security committees … mulvaney presented himself as a 'straight shooter' and said he would continue to warn about the growing costs of social security and medicare.... 'my job … is to be completely and brutally honest with him,' he said. … mulvaney said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for social security to 70 but emphasized that he would not reduce benefits for current recipients. he also reiterated his support for means-testing to qualify for medicare.\n\nrep. tom price (r-ga.), president trump's nominee to lead the health and human services department, testified before the senate finance committee, jan. 24. (sarah parnass/the washington post)\n\n6. declining to commit that consumers will be better off under obamacare replacement:\n\ntrump's choice for health secretary repeatedly refused during his own testy confirmation hearing to promise that no americans will be worse off under trump's executive order to ease provisions of the affordable care act. democrats targeted most of their questioning on the direction that tom price, if confirmed, would try to take the health-care system. price demurred repeatedly. for instance, he sidestepped a series of questions about the effects of the sweeping order trump issued just hours after his swearing-in that directed agencies to lift or soften federal rules implementing aspects of the aca. price declined to commit that no one would be harmed, that no one would lose insurance coverage or that the regulations would be rewritten only after a plan exists to replace the 2010 health-care law. (read the full write-up by amy goldstein and juliet eilperin.)\n\nad\n\nad\n\nprice said one way to cover people with preexisting conditions under an obamacare replacement would be to push them into high-risk pools, in which people with high medical costs are pooled together to avoid having their expenses drive up premiums for healthier consumers. that hasn't worked well in the past, providing costly coverage to limited numbers of people, the associated press notes.\n\nthe georgia congressman also kept the door wide open to turning medicaid into a block grant, something he has supported as chairman of the house budget committee. in one particularly heated exchange with democratic sen. bob menendez, price was asked whether turning medicaid into a block grant program would mean fewer people would be eligible in the future, cnn notes. the decades-old entitlement program extends health coverage to low-income americans, and menendez noted that as an entitlement program, anyone who meets the criteria currently has the right to be covered. 'when you move to a block grant, do you still have the right?' menendez asked. 'no, i think it would be determined by how that was set up,' price said. price's apparent acknowledgement that some low-income americans may not be covered if republicans move medicaid over to a block grant system would mark a radical shift in the purpose that the program is supposed to serve.\n\n7. retaining comey:\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhillary clinton believes very strongly that fbi director james comey cost her the election with his two announcements during the run-up to nov. 8, and she's angry that he did not publicly discuss evidence of russian interference on behalf of trump. comey's decisions to discuss the clinton probe publicly are currently being investigated by the justice department inspector general. at a white house reception on sunday, trump literally embraced comey. he's become more famous than me, the president said.\n\nthen the news broke yesterday that trump has asked comey to stay on. normally, this would not be surprising because he's only four years into a 10-year term. but the president had said previously that he would not decide whether he should stay on until they had a private meeting.\n\nand this is all playing out against a very awkward backdrop: comey briefed trump last month on the dossier that alleged that moscow had gathered compromising financial, political and personal material about him. the ensuing conversation came with seemingly unavoidable conflicts, matt zapotosky, ellen nakashima and greg miller note. it is not clear whether comey told trump that the fbi had or was still pursuing allegations made in the dossier, but doing so would have involved telling an incoming president with significant power over the fbi that his associates were potential investigative targets.\n\nhis greatest looming challenge will be presiding over ongoing investigations whose dimensions and direction are unclear. those alleged entanglements continue to expand, matt, ellen and greg write. u.s. officials said this week that the fbi has scrutinized communications between trump's national security adviser, lt. gen. michael t. flynn, and russian ambassador sergey kislyak. … u.s. officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said they have seen no evidence of wrongdoing. … the fbi for several months has been investigating allegations that trump associates or acquaintances, including his former campaign manager paul manafort, might have had improper contact with russian officials or intermediaries, u.s. officials said. the bureau is also still examining allegations in the dossier that comey discussed with trump in new york last month, according to a u.s. official.\n\n8. sessions refusing to recuse himself:\n\nad\n\nattorney general nominee jeff sessions won't commit to recusing himself from potential justice department investigations into controversies involving trump — from russia to business conflicts of interest — despite his vigorous campaigning on behalf of trump during the 2016 election season, politico's seung min kim reports. in written responses to members of the senate judiciary committee, sessions said repeatedly that he is 'not aware of a basis to recuse myself' from issues surrounding trump such as potential violations of the emoluments clause, a constitutional ban on officials accepting payments from foreign governments. that differs from sessions' vow to recuse himself from any ongoing issues involving the federal probe into clinton's use of a private email server. sessions said during his confirmation hearing that he would step aside from any such investigations because his political rhetoric against clinton during the campaign 'could place my objectivity in question.\n\nthe post's editorial board says the senate should not confirm sessions until he agrees to such a recusal: mr. trump has tapped rod j. rosenstein, a respected career prosecutor, to be deputy attorney general. mr. sessions should have no qualms about entrusting him with these politically vexing issues. it would raise confidence in his justice department and save him plenty of headaches.\n\nanother reason this matters: sessions could wind up being the point man on the investigation into voter fraud that trump promised on twitter this morning. as matt zapotosky and sari horwitz note, sessions has in the past asserted that voter fraud exists, though he has declined to endorse trump's assertion that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election. 'i don't know what the president-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement,' sessions said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, asked point blank by sen. al franken (d-minn.) whether he agreed with trump. 'i would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it. and i do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during election cycles.' …\n\npresident-day civil liberties advocates fear session's and trump's views on voter fraud could serve as a basis for them to support voter id laws that disenfranchise poor or minority voters, such as the one in north carolina that was overturned by the supreme court last summer. studies have shown in-person voter fraud, which the laws are designed to prevent, is exceptionally rare. they are also concerned that sessions hailed as 'good news, i think, for the south' a supreme court decision that gutted a critical section of the voting rights act.… one of sessions's early tests will be how — if he is confirmed — his justice department handles a voter id law in texas considered one of the strictest in the country.\n\n9. curtailing abortion:\n\nflanked by a group in the oval office that consisted entirely of men, trump reinstated the so-called mexico city policy. the reagan-era policy bans american assistance to organizations that offer abortion services, including counseling and referrals.\n\npoor women in sub-saharan africa stand to be the biggest losers from trump's order, our kevin sieff reports from nairobi: in practice, experts say, that policy will freeze millions of dollars in funding that has gone to critical health treatment, including hiv testing and neonatal care. the united states does not fund any abortion services overseas, but many health groups receive american assistance to provide other women's services, while using different funding sources to provide abortion counseling and procedures. now, those organizations will have to stop providing abortion services if they want to continue to receive u.s. aid for their other programs. the policy is known as the 'global gag rule' because it even restricts references to abortion in counseling sessions….\n\nin kenya, public health experts raised immediate concerns about the new policy. women here often resort to dangerous methods to end their pregnancies, including drinking battery acid and using wire coat hangers. in parts of rural kenya, young women have hired local healers to stomp on their stomachs until the pregnancy is deemed over. 'trump's policy means even fewer services will be offered,' said chimaraoke izugbara, a researcher at the african population and health research center (aphrc) in nairobi. 'some women will not be reached, and providers may not be available to offer services. i think we are headed to a major disaster.' nearly 8,000 women in kenya die every year from complications caused by pregnancy and childbirth. at least a fifth of those deaths are caused by self-induced abortions, according to izugbara.\n\nthen, yesterday, house republicans passed a bill that would prevent the district of columbia from using local tax dollars to subsidize abortion services for low-income women. jenna portnoy and aaron c. davis report: although the senate has never passed the bill, the vote was an ominous sign that the district could become an afterthought as congress considers targeting laws regulating guns, assisted suicide and marijuana in the nation's capital. the stakes are particularly high for the district this year, as it can no longer rely on a democratic presidential veto.\n\n10. reneging on promises of transparency\n\nduring the presidential campaign, trump said repeatedly that he could not release his returns because he is undergoing an audit and that he would do so once that process is complete. the audit has always been a flimsy excuse. nothing is stopping him from releasing the returns any way, and he could release previous years not under audit.\n\nregardless, now that he's in the oval office and will soon get to appoint one of his own people to run the irs, trump's team is changing course.\n\nthe white house response is that he's not going to release his tax returns, kellyanne conway said sunday on abc's this week. she said the issue was settled in the election. people didn't care, she said. they voted for him.\n\nthe next day she claimed that this is consistent with what was said during the campaign, but it is not. a majority of americans in every poll also still want the president to release his returns, just as they did before the election.\n\n11. taking the oil\n\nspeaking crassly in front of the honor wall at cia headquarters in langley, trump said saturday that the united states should have kept the oil after the liberation of iraq. to the victor belong the spoils, he said. so we should have kept the oil. but, okay, maybe you'll have another chance.\n\nno one knows how seriously to take trump's threat to seize iraq's oil: the recycled campaign comment is raising concerns about trump's understanding of the delicate middle east politics involved in the u.s.-led effort against extremist groups, the ap reports in a story that just moved over the wire. the statement ignores the precedent of hundreds of years of american history.… taking the oil would also require a permanent u.s. occupation, or at least until iraq's 140 billion barrels of crude run out, and a large presence of american soldiers to guard sometimes isolated oil fields and infrastructure. such a mission would be highly unpopular with iraqis, whose hearts and minds the u.s. is still trying to win to defeat groups such as [the islamic state and al-qaeda].\n\nserious republicans like bob gates and john mccain chortle at the idea:\n\nrather than try to walk it back, however, sean spicer defended trump's take the oil line during his briefing on monday. he wants to be sure america is getting something out of it for the commitment and sacrifice it is making, the press secretary said.\n\nwelcome to the daily 202, powerpost's morning newsletter.\n\nwith contributions from elise viebeck (@eliseviebeck). sign up to receive the newsletter.\n\ndriving the day:\n\n-- trump is planning to sign executive orders enabling the construction of the mexican border wall and targeting sanctuary cities. jerry markon, robert costa and abigail hauslohner report: the actions, part of a multi-day focus on immigration, are among an array of sweeping and immediate changes to the nation's immigration system under consideration by the new president. the moves represent trump's first effort to deliver on perhaps the signature issue that drove his presidential campaign: his belief that illegal immigration is out of control and threatening the country's safety and security. trump's immigration blitz this week is widely seen inside the white house as a victory for the self-described populist wing of his inner circle — which includes chief strategist [steve] bannon, attorney general nominee jeff sessions and top policy adviser stephen miller.\n\ndiscussions are ongoing about just how far to go on some policies, in particular the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which has temporarily shielded hundreds of thousands of people who arrived in the u.s. as children from deportation. trump has previously vowed to reverse it.\n\nofficials are still considering — but have not decided yet — whether to indefinitely shutter the program that allows syrian refugees into the u.s. trump may also put the entire refugee program for all countries on hold for four months: one official said trump will also potentially bar for 30 days the issuance of u.s. visas to people from iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen — all muslim-majority countries — until new visa procedures are developed. residents from many of these places are already rarely granted u.s. visas. trump may ask dhs and the director of national intelligence to evaluate whether immigrants are being adequately screened for potential terrorist ties.\n\nwhile you were sleeping:\n\ntrump will announce his supreme court nominee next thursday:\n\n-- robert barnes reports on the short list: sources involved in the process say a handful of federal appeals court judges have emerged as top contenders, including william pryor of the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta, neil gorsuch of the 10th circuit in denver, thomas hardiman of the 3rd circuit in philadelphia and raymond kethledge of the 6th circuit in cincinnati. here's the scoop on some of his top picks:\n\npryor , 54, followed jeff sessions as alabama's attorney general, and thrilled supporters at his hearing by not backing away from a previous statement that the roe v. wade decision was a constitutional abomination. he has long been considered the front-runner for the job but lately has drawn fire from staunch conservatives for upholding the right of a transgender woman to sue over being fired.\n\ngorsuch , 49, is seen as a reliable conservative, with a reputation for clear, lucid writing – though he does not boast the outsider credentials of some others on trump's list. his law clerks regularly move on to the supreme court for both conservative and liberal justices. he is an originalist, like scalia, and protective of religious rights.\n\nhardiman , 51, was the first in his family to attend college and drove a taxi to finance his education – a backstory trump may find appealing. he serves on the 3rd circuit with trump's sister maryanne trump barry, and is praised for his record on gun rights.\n\nkethledge , 50, is less well-known, but said to have support among senators. he is a university of michigan graduate who went on to clerk for justice anthony kennedy.\n\nwhat mitch mcconnell said after a bipartisan meeting with trump about scotus yesterday afternoon:\n\n-- trump took to twitter last night to re-up the idea of dispatching federal law enforcement to chicago if local officials cannot curb the city's homicide rate on their own: if chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, trump wrote, i will send in the feds! he then cited homicide figures that appear to be from a newly published chicago tribune article. it is unclear what exactly trump's suggestion would entail, or what kind of unilateral government intervention he could order to remedy the problem — but following the tweet, a spokesman for chicago mayor rahm emanuel said he welcomed the prospect of working with trump, adding that the two men had previously spoken about the issue.

'all those piles of paper they had, we haven't seen them. who knows? maybe they were all blank.'\n\n-- noteworthy: trump held stock in the company building the dakota access pipeline – raising concerns that his investments could affect his decision making related to the $3.8 billion project. cbs news reports: trump's 2016 federal disclosure forms show he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in texas-based energy transfer partners … [and] owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in phillips 66, which has a one-quarter share of dakota access. while trump's stake in the pipeline company is modest compared with his other assets, ethics experts say it's among dozens of potential conflicts that could be resolved by placing his investments in a blind trust.\n\n-- conservative radio host hugh hewitt thinks trump is on constitutional thin ice and could face impeachment if democrats retake the house of representatives in 2018. president trump has to be aware of the constitutional thin ice on which he skates, he told katie couric in a yahoo news interview, referring to ethics concerns over the handling of trump's vast business network. i think it would occur after midterms and only if the house flips to the democrats. so the potential is there, yes. ... if you abuse power, if you do anything — you don't have a lot of goodwill in the reservoir.\n\nso much for buying american:\n\n-- british designer aruna seth flew $800 suede boots from london to washington the day before the inauguration so that tiffany trump could wear them. it is unclear whether trump's youngest daughter paid for the boots, or the international flight it took to receive them, but she was also spotted in another pair of seth's nude pumps to the sunday prayer service at the washington national cathedral, emily heil reports. tiffany has always been a fan of the brand since it became familiar to her, ella weinberg, who acted as the courier, said in an email. the 23-year-old had specific requirements from us for the inauguration considering the weather.\n\ndivided america:\n\n-- a secret service agent may face disciplinary action after posting comments to facebook suggesting that she would not take a bullet for president trump. abby phillip reports: …this world has changed and i have changed, the agent wrote in the newly-surfaced posting from october. and i would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what i believe to be a disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here.\n\n-- a nebraska state senator already under fire could now face expulsion after he retweeted a joke implying that women's march protesters are too unattractive to be sexually assaulted. (ap)\n\n-- sadly, this is part of a broader trend. the ap reports that a wave of public officials – mostly male – have been reprimanded, called out, or disciplined over social media postings this week about the women's march protests. one indiana state rep posted a photo showing a women being sprayed in the face with pepper spray and a caption reading, participation trophies. now in liquid form. another suggested trump has already gotten more fat women out walking than michelle obama did in 8 years. and an illinois teacher was suspended after suggesting the protesters all had to go home to make dinner.\n\n-- money has a funny way of bringing people together: the rival campaign managers for clinton and trump are joining forces on the lucrative paid speaking circuit. robby mook and corey lewandowski will make joint appearances for tens of thousands of dollars per speech before trade associations and the like. their speaking agency promises they will be an entertaining pair sure to keep any audience engaged. it's very this town… (buzzfeed's ruby cramer)\n\ntrump cabinet:\n\n-- south carolina gov. nikki haley was confirmed as u.s. ambassador to the united nations on tuesday, after a nearly-unanimous senate voted 96-4 in her favor. meanwhile, three cabinet nominees – ben carson for hud, elaine chao for transportation, and wilbur ross for commerce – advanced out of committee. (anne gearan)\n\n-- john mccain slammed omb director-designee mick mulvaney over defense spending and his vote to withdraw troops from europe and afghanistan. politico's ben weyl and brent griffiths report: 'don't you know where 9/11 came from?' mccain asked at one point at the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee. the defense hawk said he was 'deeply concerned' about mulvaney's nomination and ripped mulvaney for saying he couldn't recall some of his voting record. 'i think i would remember if i was withdrawing troops from europe,' mccain said. mccain also slammed mulvaney for trying to shrink the overseas contingency operations account, which is intended to pay for wars abroad but has been used as a way to get around strict spending caps. after the hearing, mccain said he had not decided whether he would vote for mulvaney. asked whether he was satisfied with mulvaney's answers, an angry mccain deadpanned, 'you could tell, just totally.'\n\n-- another breitbart staffer is joining the trump white house: business insider reports that the site's national security editor, sebastian gorka, is expected to join administration. the position will likely be on the national security council.\n\n-- trump's top economic adviser gary cohn is leaving his post at goldman sachs with a payout of more than $100 million, according to a late filing from the investment bank. goldman says it paid cohn $65 million in cash for long-term bonuses he was owed, cnn money reports. it also sped up stock awards worth $35 million and lifted restrictions on $23 million in locked-up goldman shares so cohn could sell them.\n\n-- 52 is the new 47: labor secretary nominee andrew puzder said in a 2011 speech that the electoral balance in the u.s. was tilted against republicans because a large segment of the population would always vote benefits to themselves. the quote, unearthed by cnn's andrew kaczynski and chris massie: last year, 52% of the people in the country got more from government than they gave to government, puzder said. we do have a segment of the population that's going to continue to vote benefits to themselves. you have to make a decision for yourself which party actually supports that and would therefore want to continue to have those people vote for them by taking from the rich and giving to the poor, as they like to say, which tilts the electoral balance in favor of those who get the benefits. if they are more than 50% of the population, we've got a problem. he continued, in california, i think the last election showed that. i think we have higher than 52% of the people … i think 49% of the people in california don't even pay taxes.\n\n-- the federal hiring freeze trump put into place on monday could turn out to be a more symbolic, less forceful measure than it appears to be, lisa rein reports – and in fact, the memo regarding the 2.1 million civilians in the federal workforce leaves plenty of room for exceptions: federal offices in many corners of government could continue to hire, as long as the job has — or can be construed to have — a national security or public safety mission. individual cabinet secretaries and agency heads have broad leeway to decide on exemptions. and the hiring ban is scheduled to last 90 days, after which the [omb] is slated to come up with a long-term plan to shrink the federal workforce through attrition. a more permanent approach would still constitute a freeze of sorts but would resemble more of a selective slowdown, experts said. yet the language of the memorandum instituting the freeze is so vague that a day after trump signed it, agency officials were scrambling to determine whether and how the move will affect them.\n\nmore on the post-fact presidency:\n\n-- from behind his podium, sean spicer defended trump's outrageous lie that up to five million ballots were illegally cast: the president does believe that. he has stated that before, the press secretary said during a tuesday briefing. i think he stated his concerns, voter fraud and people voting illegally, during the campaign. and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him. when asked repeatedly to provide evidence, spicer pointed to a pew study that does not support trump's claim. (jenna johnson)\n\n-- state election officials released a statement tuesday saying they do not know of any evidence backing up trump's voter fraud claims, but said they were willing to hear from the new administration if they had any concerns. (mark berman)\n\n-- karen tumulty explains why trump is being short-sighted: trump allies — and adversaries — had hoped that with his inauguration, he would leave behind the hyperbolic reality-show culture that made him a celebrity. in the late stages of his presidential campaign, trump had disavowed his years-long promotion of the racially tainted falsehood that barack obama … was born outside the united states and therefore an illegitimate president. but the first days of his presidency show that, for trump, old reflexes are hard to break. veterans of previous white houses say they can recall no precedent for what trump and his top aides are doing [and] worry about the implications of this untethering from the truth … 'i don't think he realizes how much he is hurting himself,' [said former bush strategist matthew dowd]. then again, trump may well believe that this is the style which brought him to the white house, in defiance of every expectation. americans knew what they were getting when they elected him.\n\n-- the top three senate republicans refused yesterday to disavow trump's false claim that millions cast ballots illegally. from the associated press's erica werner and lisa lerer: the comments from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and his top lieutenants suggested that some leading republicans would rather follow trump into the realm of 'alternative facts' than confront the new chief executive. 'it does occur,' mcconnell told reporters at the capitol tuesday on the issue of election fraud. 'there are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent and all the rest. ... the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.' the no. 2 senate republican, john cornyn of texas, also passed up a chance to dispute trump's claim tuesday, saying 'i'm not going to re-litigate that. it's time to move on.' and the no. 3 senate republican, john thune, said he didn't know whether 3 million to 5 million votes were cast fraudulently, which would be larger than the population of all but the biggest u.s. cities [and especially his tiny home state of south dakota!], and did not happen. 'there's always a certain amount of irregularity that goes on in elections, some places perhaps more so than others. how you quantify that i'm not sure, but he must have his methodology,' thune said.\n\n-- lindsey graham is one of the very few republican senators with the courage to speak forthrightly on this in public: i would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on earth, we're the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification, lindsey told cnn.\n\n-- even mike huckabee, whose daughter is spicer's principal deputy, gently chastised trump. but he can do so because he's not running for anything. i have no evidence whatsoever, and i don't know that anyone does, that there were that many illegal people who voted, and frankly it doesn't matter, huckabee said in an interview on fox business network. he's the president and whether 20 million people voted, it doesn't matter anymore. he's the president, and i'm not sure why he brought it up.\n\n-- jerry brown seized on conway's alternative facts formulation during his state of the state address in california yesterday: the recent election and inauguration of a new president have shown deep divisions across america. we have seen the bald assertion of 'alternative facts.' we have heard the blatant attacks on science. familiar signposts of our democracy — truth, civility, working together — have been obscured or swept aside, the democratic governor said. let me be clear: we will defend everybody — every man, woman and child — who has come here and contributed to the well-being of our state. california is not turning back. not now. not ever. (katie zezima)\n\n-- spicer also took the first question at his briefing from a reporter who works for lifezette, a tiny website founded by trump supporter laura ingraham that published some untrue stories during last year's campaign. spicer's move also breaks with the longtime tradition of calling upon a famous mainstream organization, such as the ap or a major television network, first. (ap)\n\nmore on the trump agenda:\n\n-- potus is beginning his term at the helm of a stable but sluggish economy – but an increasingly ominous explosion in debt and deficit is looming in the very near future. a new report from the congressional budget office says the spending growth rate is set to outpace the rate of revenue growth after 2019, causing the deficit to explode to $1.4 trillion by the end of the decade. and, if current policies go unchanged, the cbo estimates public debt will soar to the highest rates since the period following world war ii.\n\n-- president trump invited indian prime minister narendra modi to visit later this year, white house officials said on tuesday. the invite came during a phone call between the two leaders, in which trump told modi that the u.s. considers india a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world, and discussed cooperation in economy and defense. (ap)\n\n-- the house energy and commerce committee will hold hearings on the first pieces of gop health-care replacement plans next week, signaling lawmakers are set to move swiftly on plans to repeal and replace the affordable care act. (mike debonis)\n\n-- trump officials have compiled a list of some 50 infrastructure projects across the country to place on an infrastructure priority list, as the white house tries to determine investment priorities for their nascent administration. the projects reportedly total at least $137.5 billion, and could include items such as a new terminal for the kansas city airport, upgrades to interstate 95 in north carolina and the construction of a high-speed railway from dallas to houston.

'i've known that there was no future for north korea for a long time,' thae [said] … [and] his arrival in south korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections … 'there is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between kim jong un and senior officials,' thae said.

mccain ostensibly had plenty of time to orchestrate his memorial services as he battled brain cancer for a year before his death saturday. that he would choose not to have his own vice presidential pick at his memorial service can be interpreted as a neon flashing signal to the world not just about his own personal regrets in life but how concerned he was about the rise of trumpism — and perhaps his role in it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe link from mccain to trump goes something like this: the republican senator from arizona elevated palin, then the gop governor of alaska, by picking her as his vice presidential nominee in 2008. palin in turn helped stir up and elevate certain factions on the right -- notably the kind of people who called barack obama an arab. eight years later, america elected a man to the white house who had questioned obama's birth certificate and whose base of voters fit neatly into the same categories as those who supported palin.\n\nduring an oval office meeting with kenyan president uhuru kenyatta, president trump ignored reporters' questions about sen. john mccain (r-ariz.). (the washington post)\n\nnothing is ever that simple in politics, of course. analysts have attributed the rise of hyperpartisanship and trumpism to a confluence of events. there was the 2008 recession that aggravated polarization on both sides of the aisle. the weakening of campaign finance laws allowed outside groups to spend millions to steer politics in their preferred directions and made politicians dive for safety in the ideological corners of their party. gerrymandering. voters self-sorting into liberals in cities, conservatives in rural areas. mistakes democrats made in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nwe may never fully understand this unique political moment we're in until we're out of it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut interpreted one way — the most obvious way — mccain seemed to have come to a conclusion about how trump is president: he helped lead the way.\n\nmccain's been sending us this signal for awhile now. months before his death, he wrote in his last memoir that he regretted not picking joseph lieberman, an independent senator, for his vice president. palin called that revelation a gut punch.\n\nthese memorial services aren't just about looking back on mccain's life through a certain frame; mccain used his impending death to try to steer a country he thought was going in the wrong direction back to his vision of a hawkish america championing democracy abroad.\n\nhe was diagnosed with brain cancer, then voted against republicans' efforts to repeal obamacare. he gave speeches and wrote op-eds urging americans to fight trumpism. his very last statement, prepared to be read after his death, was an indictment of trump.
the wall has never been a popular idea, a fact known to most republicans in congress. a litany of public and private polling shows that over 50 percent of americans oppose building a wall. support is in the high 30s to low 40s. public support for shutting down the government to force construction of a wall is lower.\n\nad\n\nad\n\ntrump himself has never been a strong president in conventional terms. in gallup's tracking poll, trump's approval rating has never risen above 45 percent. he's never been more popular as president than the day he took office.\n\nthat's as much why democrats aren't defecting, or more so, than the left's growing moral opposition to the very concept of walls. don't forget that trump couldn't get his wall money even when the gop had unified control of government during the past two years — when 10 senate democrats were up for reelection in states he had carried.\n\ntrump has also been checked by the courts on immigration as much as any other issue, including by gop-appointed judges, and his threat to claim emergency powers to build the wall would face certain legal challenges.\n\nad\n\ncome saturday, this partial government shutdown is poised to become the longest in u.s. history. regardless of how or when it ends, the donnybrook will have illustrated trump's weaknesses. as a result, the public image of the president will probably fall more in line with these underlying political realities.\n\nthe post's david nakamura analyzes why president trump is determined to use every avenue to make good on his promise for a wall. (luis velarde/the washington post)\n\n-- trump appears more concerned about losing his base than most people understand. he's not acting like someone who thinks he could get away with shooting a person on fifth avenue and have his core supporters stick with him. he admitted as much during a moment of candor with reporters at the white house yesterday: right now, if i did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me are my senators. they'd be angry at me, he said. the second ones would be the house. and the third ones would be, frankly, my base and a lot of republicans out there.\n\nad\n\nhe rejected a deal that his own aides and gop leaders had negotiated after conservative media personalities got to him — and ann coulter threatened not to vote for him again in 2020. he's bending over backward to show his base that he's going to the mat for a wall. that's why trump is sitting down with fox news host sean hannity later today when he goes to the border in mcallen, tex.\n\nad\n\ni think you can't cave. that's what the democrats don't understand — it's all or nothing, said trump ally rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), a leader of the house freedom caucus. the democrats think that we're about ready to fold. i think republicans think that democrats are ready to fold, and neither of those two things are accurate by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n-- trump has not been the great dealmaker as president that he promised he would be as a candidate. yes, he's made millions off writing the art of the deal. but ronald reagan at reykjavik he is not.\n\nad\n\nthe president walked out of a white house meeting with democratic leaders yesterday, calling it a total waste of time, after nancy pelosi said she's not going to cave on the wall. i said bye-bye, the president tweeted, nothing else works! democrats said trump slammed his hand on the table in anger as he exited the situation room. vice president pence denied this and said he passed out candy bars to the democrats.\n\ndemocrats and republicans had differing characterizations of a jan. 9 white house meeting with top lawmakers and president trump. (patrick martin/the washington post)\n\n-- trump has said it's better to be feared than loved, but democratic leaders simply aren't scared of him. pelosi called him petulant after the meeting and then took a dig at trump's false narrative that he's a self-made man. noting that federal workers are about to miss a paycheck, the house speaker said: he thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money. but they can't.\n\nad\n\nthe president threw another temper tantrum, added senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.).\n\nad\n\nwith the benefit of hindsight, it's now undeniable that trump blundered last january and february by turning down democratic offers that would have given him his wall in exchange for protecting the dreamers. trump caved to the hard-liners in his orbit, specifically sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) and nativist policy adviser stephen miller, and demanded massive reductions in the number of legal immigrants. it was a poison pill. but elections have consequences, and democrats now control the house. of course, they won't offer the terms they were willing to when they were in the minority. why would they?\n\ntrump's approach is a hallmark of a president who eschews strategic planning and preparation in favor of day-to-day tactical maneuvering and trusting his gut. but as he digs in against an emboldened democratic opposition, trump has found that his go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics has laid bare his shortcomings as a negotiator — preventing him from finding a way out of what may be the biggest political crisis of his presidency, david nakamura and seung min kim explain in today's paper.\n\nad\n\nwhite house allies professed confusion over the president's tactics, they report. for republicans who have tried to stick with the mercurial president, the shifting goal posts have been frustrating. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has said he will not allow a vote on any bill to reopen the government unless he receives assurances from the white house that trump supports it. 'it's always difficult,' said sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), when the person you're negotiating with is someone who changes their mind.'\n\nrepublican senators spoke to reporters before meeting with president trump on jan. 9, the 19th day of the partial government shutdown. (rhonda colvin, jorge ribas/the washington post)\n\n-- as the difficulty of divided government sinks in, the first president in u.s. history with no prior governing or military experience has changed his tune. on dec. 11, trump said he would be proud to shut down the government: if we don't get what we want, one way or the other ... i will shut down the government, he told schumer and pelosi in the oval office. so i will take the mantle. i will be the one to shut it down. i'm not going to blame you for it.\n\nad\n\nyesterday, speaking again in the oval office, he insisted: this is not a fight i wanted.\n\nad\n\n-- back in 2013, right after the gop forced a shutdown in a failed effort to defund obamacare, trump criticized barack obama for allowing it to happen. the future president defined leadership this way. whatever happens, you're responsible, he tweeted five years ago. if it doesn't happen, you're responsible.\n\n-- a general rule of thumb: whether in sports or marriages, companies or campaigns, the more often you feel compelled to say publicly that your team is unified, the less likely it's true.\n\nthere was no discussion of anything other than solidarity, trump told reporters after privately meeting with gop senators over lunch at the capitol.\n\nad\n\nbut inside the meeting with senators wednesday, there was not unanimity on trump's approach, erica werner, sean sullivan, mike debonis and seung min kim report. moderate sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) and susan collins (r-maine) pleaded with trump to reopen the government, according to lawmakers present.\n\nad\n\non the other side of the capitol, eight house republicans broke ranks and voted with every democrat to advance a bill that would reopen the treasury department and ensure that the internal revenue service remains funded through tax season.\n\npresident trump on jan. 9 said he could use his emergency powers to build the southern border wall if he can't make a deal with people who are unreasonable. (the washington post)\n\n-- trump also maintained that he has the absolute right to declare an emergency and construct the wall without congressional authorization. asked what his threshold will be for usurping legislative authority, he answered: my threshold will be if i can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\n\nad\n\nseveral conservatives have bristled publicly at this posture. sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) warned yesterday, for example, that trump declaring a national emergency would create a dangerous precedent. we have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power, rubio said on cnbc. if today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.\n\nad\n\n-- to be sure, many house democrats who just got elected in districts trump carried in 2016 are feeling some heat as the shutdown drags on. the freshmen arranged an impromptu 90-minute meeting over the weekend at a retreat in virginia because several new members were 'freaking out' about the ongoing shutdown and the party's strategy, politico's heather caygle and sarah ferris report. 'i don't think that it's the democrats in the house's fault that we are in a shutdown,' said rep. colin allred (d-texas), who attended the huddle in williamsburg, va., and is one of two freshman class presidents. 'but i do think it's setting us back in terms of those coalitions we're trying to build.'\n\nrep. abigail spanberger (d-va.), who represents a district trump won in 2016, said at a closed-door caucus meeting yesterday that democrats are losing the messaging war in her district and need to be clearer about the border security measures they support. if i am getting comments and contact from my constituents expressing concern that the democrats are not prioritizing security, then i think we can do better, she told her colleagues, per politico.\n\nwelcome to the daily 202, powerpost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nsign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nget smart fast:​​\n\nad\n\nex-cardinal theodore mccarrick could soon be defrocked after the vatican finished collecting evidence in his sexual abuse case. witnesses have testified in the past several weeks to american clergy about the alleged misconduct of mccarrick, a former archbishop of washington.

(christopher rowland) teachers in los angeles are preparing to strike on monday. the action comes after nearly two years of unsuccessful negotiations with the los angeles unified school district, the second-largest school district in the country. (moriah balingit) a new study found bullying rates at virginia middle schools were higher in school districts where trump won in 2016. the researchers who conducted the study wrote of their findings, it is obviously difficult to demonstrate a causal link between statements by a public figure and schoolyard bullying. nevertheless, there are incidents in which youth made threats and jeering statements that closely matched language used by [trump].

'while i oppose the nomination of brian buescher to the u.s. district court in nebraska, i stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers buescher's catholicism and his affiliation with the knights of columbus,' gabbard said in the op-ed.\n\n-- rep. steve king (r-iowa), known for controversial comments on immigration that have been widely criticized as racist, has attracted a 2020 primary challenge. the sioux city journal's bret hayworth reports: state sen. randy feenstra, of hull, said he is opening a federal campaign committee. a campaign website — feenstraforcongress — went live wednesday morning. … by 2 p.m., king's campaign responded by saying feenstra in late december had told jeff king, the congressman's son and campaign official, that he would not run for the position. … jeff king said the congressman is 'an effective and leading congressional ally of the president's.\n\n-- rick scott blindsides desantis on his way out, by politico's marc caputo and matt dixon: the contentious handoff of the florida governor's office from scott to fellow republican ron desantis has cast a shadow over their relationship, raising questions about whether the two prominent swing-state republicans are on a collision course as a result of their future ambitions for the white house. tensions between the old governor and the new governor had been simmering under the surface for more than a month, but it burst into public view tuesday after scott abruptly left his successor's inauguration ceremony, leading desantis to ad lib the parts of his speech in which he planned to personally thank scott. … desantis loyalists were already miffed that scott's political committee decided to throw a ball in washington to celebrate his installation in the u.s. senate that overlapped with the traditional inaugural celebration for the governor in tallahassee. those slights followed two other perceived insults friday, when the governor made more than 70 appointments without consulting desantis.\n\n-- future campaign ad material: nancy pelosi held a vote to force house republicans to go on the record about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of obamacare. mike debonis reports: the house gave itself the power to intervene legally after a federal judge ruled that the affordable care act was unconstitutional. wednesday's vote was largely symbolic — democrats voted last week to authorize legal action as part of a broader rules package — but it was the first time that lawmakers were presented with a discrete measure dealing with what was a dominant issue in the nov. 6 midterm elections. … the measure passed 235 to 192, with all democrats supporting it and all but three republicans opposing it.\n\nfederal contract workers like pablo lazaro worry about saving money and paying bills as the government shutdown continues. (jorge ribas/the washington post)\n\nthe human toll of the shutdown:\n\n-- the shutdown has sharply reduced the fda's food inspections. laurie mcginley and joel achenbach report: the agency, which oversees 80 percent of the food supply, has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, fda commissioner scott gottlieb said in an interview. he is working on a plan to bring inspectors back as early as next week to inspect facilities considered high-risk because they handle sensitive items such as seafood, soft cheese and vegetables, or have a history of problems.\n\n-- customs and border protection officers sued the trump administration over unpaid wages. deanna paul reports: the national treasury employees union became the second federal employees' union to file a lawsuit against the trump administration over the shutdown. tuesday's collective action alleges more than 400,000 federal employees — including tens of thousands of nteu members — are being forced to work without pay during the partial government closure.\n\n-- estimates indicate each week of the shutdown is costing the u.s. economy $1.2 billion. politico's victoria guida reports: the roughly 800,000 government employees who are either furloughed or working without pay will be forced to start slashing their consumer spending when paychecks don't appear this week. private-sector contractors and other workers tied to the government are already seeing damage from lost business. and a hit to the nation's financial standing is on the horizon with a warning from fitch ratings on wednesday about downgrading the government's credit rating if the shutdown persists. … [the shutdown] could also cost the u.s. government more than a billion dollars in lost productivity for 350,000 workers who are forced to stay home.\n\n-- farmers who have come to rely on government assistance amid trump's trade war are struggling to cope without checks. annie gowen, jeff stein and sean sullivan report: the trump administration had promised to help farmers like [john] boyd, those who suffered as a result of the international trade war after chinese purchases of soybeans — once 60 percent of the market — plummeted to next to nothing. with farmers on the edge of ruin, the u.s. government offered $12 billion in support since september, checks that had become a lifeline. but with the government shutdown moving into its third week, boyd was left waiting for his support check to arrive.\n\n-- the shutdown is also holding up government loans to small businesses. heather long, david j. lynch and renae merle report: the small business administration stopped processing new loans on dec. 22. [thousands of people] can't get their sba loans approved, meaning they can't get money they need to start or expand their companies. … even if the shutdown ends soon, there will be a backlog at the sba.\n\n-- a coast guard program offered service employees recommendations for how to get through the shutdown, such as holding a garage sale or babysitting. dan lamothe reports: the suggestions were part of a five-page tip sheet published by the coast guard support program ... it is designated to offer coast guard members help with mental-health issues or other concerns about their lives, including financial wellness.

(drea cornejo, jon gerberg/the washington post)\n\ndebating the wall:\n\n-- a dhs test of a steel slat prototype of the wall showed it could be sawed through. nbc news's jacob soboroff and julia ainsley report: the trump administration directed the construction of eight steel and concrete prototype walls that were built in otay mesa, california, just across the border from tijuana, mexico. trump inspected the prototypes in march 2018. he has now settled on a steel slat, or steel bollard, design for the proposed border barrier additions. steel bollard fencing has been used under previous administrations. however, testing by dhs in late 2017 showed all eight prototypes, including the steel slats, were vulnerable to breaching, according to an internal february 2018 u.s. customs and border protection report.\n\n-- contrary to trump's rhetoric in his immigration address, apprehensions at the border are relatively low compared with past points in recent u.s. history. from brittany renee mayes, aaron williams and laris karklis: u.s. border patrol took just over 400,000 people illegally entering the united states into custody in 2018, down from the second-high of 1.67 million in 2000. the washington post fact checker salvador rizzo reported that most of these declines have come, 'partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers.'\n\n-- many lawmakers who represent districts along the border, including some republicans, are either opposed to a wall or to using emergency powers to build it. matt viser reports: rep. mac thornberry (r-tex.), the top republican on the house armed services committee, this week said he opposes an emergency declaration to build the wall. rep. will hurd (r-tex), whose district includes 820 miles along the border, has repeatedly spoken out and voted against it. dennis nixon, a bank executive from laredo who was a top trump donor, has published a lengthy rebuttal to trump's desire for a wall.\n\n-- building the wall could take at least 10 years, even with 10,000 workers. (todd frankel does the math.)\n\n-- they say it's a medieval solution, a wall. it's true, trump said. because it worked then, and it works even better now.\n\n-- in an richly reported meditation on the history of walls, marc fisher notes that border walls have a checkered history of maintaining separation between people: no matter how high, how long, how strong the wall, people have an uncanny knack for finding their way over, under and around. … some historians contend that walls have repeatedly proved their worth: they protect communities from perceived threats, bringing the people inside the wall together in security and camaraderie. yet walls can also undermine community, creating and cementing 'us vs. them' antagonisms, letting wall builders avoid resolution of the problems they face.\n\n-- throughout history, autocratic leaders have relied on walls to control their people, nina khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at the new school, writes in an op-ed for nbc. from the fierce tyrant who first began building china's great wall in roughly 220 bc to soviet leader nikita s. khrushchev (my great-grandfather as it happens) who ordered construction of the berlin wall in 1961, walls have represented undemocratic forces.\n\n-- additional commentary in today's newspaper:\n\nmetro columnist theresa vargas : trump asked you to imagine being victimized by an immigrant. we should imagine instead, 'we're all roxana.'\n\njulia young , a historian at catholic university of america: a wall can't solve america's addiction to undocumented immigration. for more than 70 years, undocumented immigrants have shaped the u.s. economy.\n\nnorma pimentel , a sister of the missionaries of jesus, is director of catholic charities for the rio grande valley: welcome to the border, mr. president.\n\ndonna edwards , the former maryland democratic congresswoman: beware when you hear trump wave a flag for african americans.\n\n-- mark morgan, a career fbi official who served as border patrol chief for the last six months of the obama administration before being removed once trump took office, has come out this week in support of a wall. ( colby itkowitz)\n\n-- some landowners along the border are gearing up to fight the government's planned construction of the wall. the ap's nomaan merchant reports: congress in march funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in texas. the government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the rio grande valley. those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel. many have hired lawyers who are preparing to fight the government if, as expected, it moves to seize their land through eminent domain.\n\n-- trump's handling of the shutdown has demonstrated how white house communications director bill shine is not directing the messaging coming out of the west wing. the new york times's katie rogers and maggie haberman report: an alumnus of fox news, where he was known as a protector of the network's chairman, roger e. ailes, mr. shine has confined his white house role mainly to stagecraft, people who have worked with him say, and mr. trump, who chafes against being managed, has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done. once he was back in washington, mr. shine was among the aides pushing mr. trump to deliver tuesday's prime-time oval office speech and make a visit to the border on thursday. and it was mr. shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when mr. trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech. … to his friends and allies, mr. trump wistfully brings up hope hicks, his most successful communications director, who departed nearly a year ago.\n\nthere's a bear in the woods:\n\n-- the white house has beefed up its legal team and plans to aggressively invoke executive privilege in a bid to contain the potential fallout of the mueller report and curtail oversight by house democrats. carol d. leonnig reports: the strategy to strongly assert the president's executive privilege on both fronts is being developed under newly arrived white house counsel pat cipollone, who has hired 17 lawyers in recent weeks to help in the effort. he is coordinating with white house lawyer emmet flood, who is leading the response to [mueller's] report. … of particular concern to democrats: whether the white house will seek to use executive privilege to keep private any portions of mueller's report that addresses alleged obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nthere is a growing sense that the special counsel's closely held investigation could come to culmination soon. some trump advisers think mueller could deliver the confidential report explaining his findings to senior justice department officials next month. under the rules authorizing the special counsel, the attorney general can then decide whether to share the report or parts of it with congress and the public. some house leaders have vowed to immediately seek to obtain a copy of mueller's findings. but the white house would resist the release of details describing confidential and sensitive communications between the president and his senior aides, trump advisers say. it is unclear whether the special counsel's report will refer to material that the white house views as privileged communications obtained from interviews with senior white house officials. some trump advisers anticipate that mueller may simply write a concise memo laying out his conclusions about the president's actions.\n\nhowever, rudolph w. giuliani, one of trump's personal attorneys, said the president's lawyers have made clear to justice department officials that they want to see mueller's completed report before the department decides what to share with congress.\n\nthe white house counsel's office was down to fewer than 20 lawyers late last year, compared with 40 to 50 in past administrations: since his arrival in december, cipollone has increased the staff to roughly 35 lawyer and aims to bolster the ranks to 40 in the coming weeks … he also hired three deputies, all with extensive experience in past republican white houses and the justice department. … cipollone first met trump when fox news commentator laura ingraham, a close friend, recommended him to help prepare the then-candidate for the 2016 presidential debates.\n\n-- treasury secretary steve mnuchin, who will deliver a briefing today to house members on his decision to lift sanctions on companies linked to a russian oligarch, is attracting more scrutiny from house democrats. nbc news's heidi przybyla reports: mnuchin … has largely escaped investigative scrutiny. but because of his role in the campaign — and, most recently, the dec. 19 announcement easing sanctions on companies aligned with oleg deripaska, the putin ally with ties to former trump campaign chairman paul manafort — house democrats believe mnuchin should be a focus of and source of information for several planned investigations both related and unrelated to the russia probe, according to the aides. these include examinations of trump's finances and the business practices of the trump organization.\n\n-- senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley (r-iowa) said he's looking into whether he could obtain trump's tax returns. from bloomberg news's laura davison and kaustuv basu: grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. … still, the iowa republican cautioned that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask treasury to release the documents. 'don't interpret this as looking into it, but i'm going to have a briefing by joint tax on what all of this involves before i answer any questions,' grassley told reporters on wednesday, referring to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation.\n\n-- republican senators promised william barr would not interfere with mueller's investigation if he is confirmed as attorney general. karoun demirjian, seung min kim and devlin barrett report: 'based on what i heard, he has a high opinion of mr. mueller, believes mr. mueller is doing a professional job, will do a professional job and be fair to the president and the country as a whole,' senate judiciary committee chairman lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) told reporters, adding that barr sees 'no reason for mr. mueller to stop doing his job and is committed to allowing mr. mueller to finish.' graham is one of four republican senators with whom barr met on wednesday, as he prepares for a two-part confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee next tuesday and wednesday. sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), one of the senators who met with barr on wednesday afternoon, emerged citing similar confidence that the nominee would be largely hands-off when it came to mueller's probe.\n\n-- but chuck schumer has called on trump to rescind barr's nomination over the nominee's past criticism of the mueller probe. citing a memo barr wrote last year that described mueller's investigation of possible obstruction of justice as fatally misconceived, schumer said on the senate floor, the senate … should subject mr. barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week, and i still believe, after the revelations about mr. barr's unsolicited memo, president trump ought to withdraw this nomination. (politico)\n\n-- the center for american progress has tracked more than 100 contacts between members of trump's campaign and transition team and russian-linked officials. usa today's christal hayes reports: 'this wasn't just one email or call, or one this or that,' said talia dessel, a research analyst for the left-leaning organization. 'over 100 contacts is really significant because you don't just have 100 contacts with a foreign power if there's nothing going on there.' … dessel noted the group's list of contacts is on the 'conservative' end and the 'very minimum amount of contacts' between russian-linked officials and those within the trump campaign and transition.\n\n-- the new york times corrected a story we included

to have known about, much less approved of, any of the deception. mr. jones had quickly pledged to seek an inquiry, but his notarized letter on wednesday … represented his first formal step in support

equivalent of 500 million pages of material — that included highly sensitive hacking tools. but the nsa's enhanced vigilance was not what led to martin's arrest at his home in glen burnie, md. rather,

here's what we learned from the document, as well as the big tax questions the white house still hasn't answered.\n\n1. a bigger tax cut for the middle class\n\nad\n\nad\n\nduring the campaign, president trump proposed massive tax relief for the wealthy. with this new statement of principles, it appears the white house may be moving in the direction of doing somewhat more for the middle class — though the details are unclear.\n\ncurrently, households do not pay taxes on a certain minimum amount of income, depending on size and family status. during the campaign, trump proposed exempting households from paying taxes on their first $15,000 in income, regardless of the type or size of the household. he also proposed bringing the minimum marginal rate that ordinary households pay on their income up from 10 percent to 12 percent.\n\naccording to the new document, there would be no increase in that minimum rate. households would be able to avoid taxes on their first $25,200 in income for a married couple (the figure for individual taxpayers would be half that), but on top of that, there could be additional exemptions depending on the size of the household, as in the current system.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe document does not say anything about those personal exemptions, as they are called, and how trump intends to handle those exemptions is crucial to how his plan will affect ordinary families.\n\nmeanwhile, the uppermost marginal rate — paid by the most affluent households — will be 35 percent, according this document, as opposed to the 33 percent that trump proposed during the campaign. (it is currently just under 40 percent.)\n\nanother piece of evidence suggesting that trump and his aides want to do more for working-class taxpayers is that the white house is looking for a new direction on child care.\n\ntrump was the first republican presidential nominee to propose federal child-care benefits, but his plan was criticized because it would disproportionately help wealthy parents. a senior administration official told the washington post tuesday that trump's staff is trying to find a way to address those criticisms. wednesday's document states that child care will be part of trump's plan but offers no further details.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n2. a bigger tax cut for the rich\n\nthe plan is still a boon for the rich, however. trump would repeal the estate tax, which is levied on the inheritances of the wealthy. the richest 10 percent of taxpayers are projected to pay 90 percent of estate taxes this year, according to the nonpartisan tax policy center.\n\ntrump would also repeal a fee on wealthy taxpayers' investments imposed as part of president obama's health-care legislation, also known as obamacare. most economists believe that reducing the rate on corporate income to 15 percent would mainly benefit those who own stock in those corporations, who tend to be richer.\n\nin all, trump has so far proposed minor changes to his plan from the campaign. the tax policy center forecast that 51 percent of the benefits from that plan would eventually accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.\n\nad\n\nad\n\n3. will trump stick to conventional gop wisdom?\n\na broader question is not how the plan would affect rich households as opposed to the poor, but what it would mean for the u.s. economy overall.\n\nmany in the republican party argue that simply reducing rates is enough to encourage work and investment, since reduced rates imply that taxpayers can keep more of their income. trump is proposing plenty of reduced rates, bringing them down to 35 percent for rich individual taxpayers and 15 percent for corporations and businesses.\n\nyet some conservative thinkers have argued while reducing rates could be beneficial, they are already very low by historical standards, and other changes to the tax system might be more important for growth. the document published wednesday does not discuss these new ideas, such as helping taxpayers and firms recover the costs of new investments.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nan important caveat is that the document is very brief, and republican lawmakers will have opportunities to share their ideas about how to stimulate the economy going forward.\n\n4. how will trump try to bring jobs back from overseas?\n\ncriticism of international trade was paramount in trump's appeal to voters, but the document released wednesday does not answer basic questions about whether he would address this issue in terms of taxes.\n\ntrump and his advisers have repeatedly said they support some form of taxation on imports. one possibility is the plan proposed by republicans in the house, including speaker paul d. ryan (wis.), which would tax imports at the regular rate on corporate income.\n\nad\n\ncurrently, companies are allowed to deduct any imports from the income on which they must pay taxes. the republican proposal is known as a border adjustment.\n\nad\n\nanother approach would be what trump has described a reciprocal tax, which would aim to match taxes imposed on certain goods in different countries around the world with some corresponding tax in the united states.\n\nthe new document offers no information about how imports or exports would be taxed.\n\n5. is there a big loophole in the plan?\n\nthe success of trump's plan could depend on how successful his aides and republican staff on the hill are in avoiding a major loophole that could be created by his plan.\n\nad\n\ntrump's proposal would open up a major discrepancy between the rate for individual taxpayers (35 percent in the new document) and the rate for corporations and businesses (the document calls for 15 percent). that gives individual taxpayers a good reason to claim that they are, in fact, businesses to avoid taxes.\n\nad\n\nthe tax policy center projects that taxpayers exploiting this potential loophole could reduce the taxes the government collects by $2.6 trillion over 20 years. that is more than half as much as the main component of the individual plan, the reduction in rates on ordinary income. the lower rates are forecast to cost $4 trillion over the same period.
presidential executive orders are a comparatively popular tool. if we tally them all from harry truman (1945-1953) up through barack obama, we get a total of 4,244. different presidents, of course, leaned on them to different degrees: at the high end, truman averaged 117 each year; obama's average was a mere 35 .\n\npresidential candidates often promise to change policy with the stroke of a pen on day one of a new administration. such rhetoric implies that a flurry of executive orders issued immediately after inauguration — like the calendar leaves falling in an old movie — could quickly reverse the previous president's course.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nbut how often do presidents reverse executive orders — especially in the first days of a new administration — after a party turnover?\n\nhere's how we checked.\n\nwe used the national archives' executive orders disposition tables to determine how many executive orders were explicitly revoked or superseded by each of the 12 presidents who have served since franklin d. roosevelt. we counted reversals within newly elected presidents' first 30 days in office. that count was quite low. nine presidents reversed three or fewer in that time; obama hit the high, reversing eight previous presidents' executive orders within 30 days.\n\nwhen we checked to see how many orders were reversed within a new administration's first 60 days, the numbers were still relatively low. six presidents still reversed three or fewer. gerald ford took second place, reversing 17, while ronald reagan took top place, reversing 22 of his predecessors' executive orders.\n\nwhat about over their entire terms? there george w. bush takes top place, reversing 64 executive orders. the rest reversed 52 or fewer. their annual averages ranged widely. bill clinton reversed 5.5 per year; john f. kennedy reversed 10.3. richard nixon, ford and george w. bush each averaged eight or more reversals annually. you can see the range of our data in the table below.\n\nnote that these are not the number of executive orders issued by presidents, but rather the number of previous executive orders reversed by each president; some executive orders reverse more than one previous executive order.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nlet's look at the totals.\n\nout of those 4,244 executive orders issued by truman and presidents since, their white house successors reversed only 508, or about 12 percent of the total. only 5 percent of those reversals came during the first 30 days of their terms, and only 14 percent during the first 60 days.\n\nwouldn't you think that when the white house changed parties — when a republican took over after a democrat, or vice versa — the new occupant would reverse more executive orders? it's not so. interestingly, the annual average of reversals didn't differ much after party turnover transitions (7.8 percent) or party continuity transitions (7.1 percent). nor do presidential reversals vary much by party: republicans revoked roughly seven orders on average, democrats eight. that may be because most executive orders are routine and administrative.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nonly the rare executive order truly sets or changes policy — and those keep changing.\n\na few flip back and forth as presidents — and the political climate — changes.\n\nfor instance, in reaction to nixon's abuses of presidential power, jimmy carter replaced nixon's executive order 11652 on secrecy and classification by issuing his own executive order 12065, requiring more open access to government policies and documents. his successor, reagan, then reversed carter's order with his own (12356), tightening secrecy again. clinton revoked reagan's order with executive order 12958, pushing the government back toward openness. george w. bush then issued executive order 13233 to assert more presidential control over the release of governmental records. and shortly after his inauguration, obama revoked the bush order and later replaced it with his own approach to classification (eo 13526).\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthere's more to executive power than executive orders.\n\nof course, as andrew rudalevige regularly writes here at tmc, many unilateral actions can be taken without issuing executive orders. memoranda (previously letters) have the same legal authority as executive orders, although they are often not listed in the federal register, as is required for executive orders.\n\nfor instance, reagan's mexico city policy, which denied u.s. government funding for nongovernmental organizations that provided advice, counseling, or information regarding abortion, was reversed and then reinstated in a series of memoranda by presidents clinton, george w. bush and obama. trump will likely make another reversal.\n\nad\n\nin addition, presidents have other ways of changing the direction of government. even without issuing a formal directive by executive order or memorandum, presidents can institute important policies by, for example, instructing agency heads to issue guidelines. this is how the department of homeland security implemented obama's instruction to carry out parts of the dream act without congressional approval, through guidances known as delayed action for childhood arrivals (daca) and deferred action for parents of americans (dapa). dhs then prioritized the implementation of deportation of undocumented persons, later reversed by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit.\n\nbut to sum up, the rhetoric of sweeping, day-one change is almost always belied by the reality of presidential life. it will be interesting to see whether trump meant his promises to reverse obama policies literally — and will issue that flurry of executive orders — or whether he meant it seriously, and will reach his goals through other means. or perhaps changing the direction of the ship of state will be more difficult than he anticipated.\n\njames p. pfiffner is university professor of public policy at the schar school of policy and government at george mason university.
the plan isn't likely to garner much — if any — attention from gop house and senate leaders, who after last year's repeal-and-replace debacle resigned themselves to the impossibility of fully ditching the law as they'd promised for so long. moderate republicans couldn't stomach dramatic medicaid cuts, and conservatives refused to vote for a replacement bill that left too much of the affordable care act intact.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nnow, health care is one of the last policy issues republicans want to discuss at this point in the midterm election season, although most of them won't admit it.\n\nthe latest plan is being forged by leaders at the conservative think tanks heritage foundation and the galen institute, along with former senator rick santorum and yuval levin of the ethics and public policy center. they've been meeting regularly over the past eight months to craft a recommendation for congress to repeal much of the aca's coverage requirements and taxes, turn over some of its spending to states through block grants and expand the use of tax-free health savings accounts.\n\nsome details of the proposal are still being hashed out. but those involved say the plan will probably be released mid-june, and white house staffers have been briefed on it.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwe're nailing down the final details … and then boning up support between now and then as much as possible, heritage action's dan holler told me last week.\n\nfrom former senator and presidential candidate santorum:\n\nand heritage:\n\nthe group might be aiming for an unrealistic goal in enacting its plan, despite the gop majorities in congress and a republican president.\n\nbut at least its members are being brutally honest about the political pickle in which their allies in congress find themselcves: it's republicans – and not democrats – who are taking heat for obamacare's rate hikes since they hold the reins of power and have tinkered with the aca marketplaces without actually revamping them.\n\nad\n\nrepublicans have no compelling answer to charges that they're to blame for premium increases in the marketplaces, holler said.\n\nad\n\nthe party needs to do something, holler said. it's not entirely their fault, [but] they have no answer to it. the left is sort of extraordinarily motivated, and the republican base is demoralized.\n\nholler and his compatriots are reasoning that the political pressure from democrats will eventually build to the point that gop house and senate members in tough races will decide they must rally around a health-care plan — even though multiple versions of repeal-and-replace failed to gain enough traction in the senate last year, and the stakes are even higher as republicans try to hold onto their house majority (i explained more fully in this health 202 why it's even harder to repeal obamacare now compared to last year.)\n\nad\n\nat some point they're going to be looking for a solution, and our goal is to have a solution ready for them, holler said.\n\nad\n\nsome members of congress are more sympathetic to the cause than others. sen. roger wicker (r-miss.), who has been tracking the heritage-led effort, seemed to feel the plan might give congress another chance to repeal obamacare.\n\nthere are very thorough efforts underway … to bring forward a bill that might succeed, wicker told me recently. i do not, he responded when i asked whether he thinks repeal-and-replace is dead for good.\n\nanother senate republican, who would speak about the path forward on health care only on the condition of anonymity, said republicans should revisit repealing the health-care law since most of them were elected on an anti-aca platform.\n\nad\n\n[we] campaigned for nearly a decade on repeal of obamacare, and we ought to bring it back up, the senator said.\n\nlast year, heritage and other conservative activists criticized most of the proposed republican-led health-care bills for leaving too much of the aca in place — and called for even more dramatic shifts in how the government's medicaid program fo low-income americans works.\n\nad\n\nin a critique of the senate's better care reconciliation act, several heritage experts advocated for shifting medicaid to what's known as a premium support system involving private plans, rolling back obamacare's requirements for insurers to cover certain preventive services, and permanently repealing its tax on high-cost health plans.\n\nad\n\nstarting with this current legislative effort, the senate should maximize its opportunity to provide individual americans with better and more affordable health care options by making further changes to free states from obamacare's centralized insurance mandates, improve medicaid reform, and provide individual americans with better health care options, they wrote last june.\n\nconservatives were also critical of the bill advanced last fall by sens. bill cassidy (r-la.) and lindsey graham (r-s.c.). they liked how it transferred obamacare's subsidies and medicaid expansion dollars to states, but feared states might still use the funds to expand government programs. the plan they're working on will probably include more rules for how states could use block grant funds, such as restricting states from maintaining an expanded medicaid program for able-bodied, childless adults.\n\nad\n\nmore than 30 conservative leaders have endorsed the coming plan, signing a letter last month promising it will lower monthly premiums and stabilize markets by giving states more dollars to use as they'd like and expanding private plan options.\n\nad\n\nwe believe this path could get majority support in congress and show the american people that members understand their distress, they wrote. congressional republicans are right to worry about obamacare's problems. they would be wise to consider this plan as the true solution to the problems facing america under obamacare.\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: rates of opioid abuse declined in younger generations between 2002 and 2014, but they've doubled among americans over 50, our colleague joe davidson writes. unwittingly, medicare compounds the epidemic by funding needed opioids that can be abused, but, generally, not funding the care and medicines needed to fight opioid addiction, joe writes. many elderly get hooked on opiates through prescriptions, rather than street drugs like heroin.\n\nad\n\nolder americans are among those unseen in this epidemic, sen. bob casey, the top democrat on the senate special committee on aging, said during a hearing on opioid misuse by the elderly at a hearing last week. in 2016, one in three people with a medicare prescription drug plan received an opioid prescription. this puts baby boomers and our oldest generation at great risk.\n\nad\n\ngary cantrell, a deputy inspector general at the department of health and human services, told the panel about a half-million medicare part d recipients received high amounts of opioids in 2016. almost 20 percent of that group are at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose, he warned, placing the high risk in two categories — those receiving extreme amounts of opioids and some who appeared to be 'doctor shopping.'\n\nfentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is quickly becoming a major contributor to the u.s. addiction crisis. here are the top things

(amber ferguson/the washington post)\n\noof: nebraska state troopers seized 118 pounds of fentanyl — containing enough lethal doses to kill tens of millions of people — in a record-breaking drug bust last month, the post's lindsey bever reports. nebraska state patrol col. john bolduc announced thursday the massive amount of suspected opioids tested positive for fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin. nebraska officials said it marked the largest fentanyl seizure in state history and one of the largest in the united states.\n\ni'm especially proud of our troopers and our staff, because these drugs, as we know, are contributing to the opioid crisis in our country, which is killing americans every single day, bolduc said thursday at a news conference. this work is saving lives. we can't even extrapolate out the number of lives that this particular bust has impacted.\n\nouch: another person has died from ebola in congo, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities from the outbreak to 12, the nation's health ministry said sunday. there are also four new suspected cases of ebola in the rural area of iboko, where the death occurred, the ap's saleh mwanamilongo reports. there are now 35 confirmed cases of ebola in the congo.\n\nad\n\nthe next few weeks are crucial in determining whether the outbreak announced in may can be brought under control, according to the world health organization, saleh writes. complicating factors include its spread to a major city, that health workers are among those infected and the existence of three or four 'separate epicenters,' making finding and monitoring the contacts of infected people more difficult.\n\nhealth on the hill\n\n— republican fears that sen. john mccain's (r-ariz.) battle with cancer could make it harder to keep their senate majority have receded, with a crucial election deadline just days away, our colleagues sean sullivan and michael scherer report. republicans in arizona and washington are increasingly hopeful mccain will be in office through may 30, the unofficial date for averting a special election for his seat this year. the gop, which holds a 51-to-49 senate majority, is defending the arizona seat held by retiring sen. jeff flake (r). another race in the state would give democrats a new opening to win control of the senate.\n\nunder state law, republican gov. doug ducey would appoint a successor to mccain if the seat is vacant, sean and michael write. ducey is not speculating publicly about who he might appoint, even as republicans in the state have mentioned his chief of staff and the state treasurer as possibilities ... friends who have visited mccain as he struggles with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer are encouraged by his recent state, though they recognize the 81-year-old's condition could deteriorate rapidly.\n\n— democrats are pushing for bigger government, feeling liberated from years of countering attacks on big spending ideas after republicans made some high-cost moves themselves. in recent months, democratic lawmakers and candidates have endorsed plans allowing anyone to buy in to medicare, to make college effectively debt-free, to replace the payday loan industry with small government banks and to provide a 'job guarantee' that would spend to put people to work, our colleagues dave weigel and jeff stein report.\n\nthe new attitude is a concern for some democrats. members of both parties have recently moved to dreaming big dreams without figuring out how to pay for it, said sen. thomas r. carper (d-del.). i came [to congress] with the idea that we'd be fiscally responsible, and neither party seems to be. my hope is we'll get back to that sooner rather than later.\n\nbut since the tax cut's passage, the trend has been in the other direction. when sen. bernie sanders of vermont...introduced his universal medicare bill last year, he did not immediately say how it would be paid for, dave and jeff note. he had offered a list of potential tax hikes to pay for it but didn't include them in the bill. and in a new ad for her reelection campaign, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), who is facing a challenge this year from her own party, tells california's primary voters that she favors a health care 'public option' and the expansion of medicare to people 55 and older, with no suggestion of how it would be paid for.\n\ntrump temperature\n\n— joe grogan -- the white house official who is driving part of the trump administration's drug price proposals -- is also a former drug industry lobbyist, raising questions about whether he violated ethics rules, politico reports.\n\ngrogan didn't obtain a waiver from complying with a directive the president established during his first week in office that would block lobbyists from regulating on a specific issue area in the administration for two years, david pittman reports. (the health 202 wrote about grogan back in november.) the administration insists grogan didn't need a waiver because his current role doesn't overlap with his former work with gilead sciences.\n\nbut with the trump administration now pledging to take on the high cost of prescription medicines...grogan, as omb's associate director of health programs, will be in a pivotal position shaping drug policy — including aspects of medicare and medicaid...some critics see a conflict, david writes. grogan is hardly the only former lobbyist or industry official in the top ranks of the administration, but he is an exception among senior federal health policymakers for not completing federal ethics forms that laid out potential conflicts with his past work and what, if any, activities he would recuse himself from. hhs secretary alex azar and centers for medicare & medicaid services administrator seema verma completed such forms.\n\nreproductive wars\n\n— the irish backed overturning the country's abortion prohibition late last week in a landslide vote that reflects ireland's emergence as a socially liberal country no longer obedient to catholic dictates, the post's william booth and isaac stanley-becker report. with all ballots counted and turnout at a near-historic high, election officials reported saturday that 66.4 percent voted to legalize abortion and 33.6 percent opposed it.\n\nthe outcome of the referendum friday was a decisive win for the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment to the irish constitution, william and isaac write. the 1983 amendment enshrined an 'equal right to life' for mothers and 'the unborn' and outlawed almost all abortions — even in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormality or non-life-threatening risk to maternal health.\n\nwhat we have seen today is a culmination of a quiet revolution that has been taking place in ireland for the past 10 or 20 years, prime minister leo varadkar said.\n\nthe turnout was 64.1 percent — the third-highest for a referendum vote since the adoption of the constitution in 1937 and the decision to join the european economic community in 1972, our colleagues note. by comparison, turnout was just over 60 percent when ireland voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\n— a few more good reads from the post and beyond:\n\nmedical missives\n\nindustry rx\n\ndaybook\n\ntoday\n\nbrookings institution holds an event on its medical marijuana documentary-short.\n\nthe public health foundation and catholic health association hold a webinar on community health.\n\ncoming up\n\nwednesday . the health it expo begins on\n\nwednesday . the national cancer institute's rural cancer control meeting begins on\n\nwednesday . the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health holds a panel discussion on alternatives to animal testing on\n\nthursday . the nih pain consortium symposium begins on\n\nthursday . ahip holds a webinar on telemedicine on\n\nfriday. the 2018 american society of clinical oncology annual meeting begins on\n\nsugar rush\n\nrep. thomas garrett (r-va.) is the latest republican to leave congress. here's what you need to know:\n\nrep. thomas garrett (r-va.) announced may 28 he is not seeking re-election, joining a growing list of gop lawmakers on their way out.

(later, i would come to question tax-cut orthodoxy.) my colleagues and i bemoaned liberal bias among journalists, but we never believed the media owed us anything or that our free speech was being squelched. we were conservatives: we believed that competition would sort out which ideas would see the light of day. the media referee wasn't government; it was the news consumer.\n\nthe republican argument, which eventually gained traction with readers and viewers, held that private enterprise knew what was best and should be left to its own devices. executives and their allies in elective office advanced climate change skepticism in the service of environmental deregulation; during george w. bush's presidency, they advocated partial privatization of social security; they defended the right of bake shops to decline customers ordering same-sex wedding cakes; they argued successfully on behalf of companies like hobby lobby declining to pay for employees' contraceptive care under obamacare; they battled the nebulous foe of political correctness, labeling those on the left as snowflakes for favoring, in their view, restrictions, not freedom, in the domain of political speech.\n\nthese demands for liberty were always partial — often philosophically inconsistent. antiabortion arguments often disguise a powerful role for government in regulating women's bodies; restricting illegal immigration necessarily implicates government prohibition on hiring undocumented employees; in the trump era, efforts to punish china for its trade policies led many on the right to endorse tariffs and quotas that raise prices and inhibit consumer choice — an approach long considered anti-free market. similarly, conservatives who once championed abolition of the fairness doctrine now seem to wish for some sort of government intervention to force social media platforms to look the other way when voices on the right post baseless conspiracy theories, dangerously incorrect health data or even foment violence on their platforms.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmany voices on the right seem to have abandoned the idea that the marketplace can be trusted to sort itself out. in response to the de-platforming of parler, podcaster buck sexton decried big tech censorship, missing the irony that parler, a private entity, was effectively shut down by other private entities — and that sexton retained a platform to issue his critique of big tech via twitter.\n\nit's not clear if it has occurred to him, and others, what should be obvious: the first amendment protects private speech from government censorship, but not from de-platforming by a private concern. or that twitter's decision to ban trump, or a publisher's decision to cancel publication of hawley's book, are expressions of corporate values that reflect market forces. some argue that twitter is more like a public utility than a private outlet — and therefore shouldn't censor certain voices — but that view runs counter to how conservatives have framed the role of private enterprise: twitter isn't the phone company; it's the christian-owned bakery, or hobby lobby.\n\nif twitter were required to allow trump to remain on its platform, even if it concludes that he has serially violated its terms of service — if private companies were required to host parler, even after determining that anti-democratic rhetoric proliferated on its platform — that wouldn't be a win for the first amendment or the marketplace of ideas. it would be a top-down mandate that private concerns are required to tolerate, and indirectly participate in, the dissemination of misinformation and of lawlessness, imposed by an arbitrary standard of fairness.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthe idea of repealing section 230 of the communications decency act, a provision that trump and his acolytes — such as sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) — have repeatedly railed against, could very well lead to increased scrutiny of right-wingers on the internet. now, under the law, social media companies aren't treated as traditional publishers, thus they are offered protection from lawsuits related to content posted by their users and leeway to make good faith efforts at restricting content they deem obscene, violent or harassing. removing section 230 could increase the chances that these companies would be exposed to greater liability, potentially motivating them to more tightly restrict content that defames, incites or otherwise violates laws that apply to traditional media such as newspapers.
ad\n\nthat logic shows just how much the risk pool is deteriorating in the aca and how poorly structured the funding mechanism and premium model is, bertolini said. i think you will see a lot more withdrawals this year of plans.\n\nlarge insurance companies are bowing out of health care exchanges citing financial losses. here's what that means for obamacare. (daron taylor/the washington post)\n\nbertolini said his company has not decided whether to continue selling insurance in the exchanges in 2018, but it already has exited most of the markets where it previously sold plans, remaining in only four states this year. he said that aetna is the only insurer left in nebraska's public exchange.\n\nad\n\nthere isn't any risk sharing going on in nebraska. it will cost us a lot of money, bertolini said.\n\nhowever, there is at least one other insurer offering coverage through the exchanges in nebraska, medica.\n\nad\n\nbertolini drew a portrait of the health insurance landscape caught in a deteriorating cycle. with too many sick people and not enough healthy ones buying insurance, he argued, the premiums have to keep going up. the more the premiums increase, the fewer healthy people want to sign up for care. they opt to pay the penalty instead of buying insurance with a massive deductible. that causes the balance of sick and healthy people buying insurance to worsen, prompting more rate increases and causing people — and insurers — to drop out.\n\nhe said that aetna's heaviest utilizers of health care — the top 1 percent to 5 percent — are driving half of the costs in the exchanges.\n\nad\n\nmy anticipation would be that in '18, we'll see a lot of markets without any coverage at all, bertolini said.\n\nbut health policy experts argue that, so far, there aren't clear signs that bertolini's assessment is accurate. cynthia cox, associate director of a program focused on health reform and private insurance at the kaiser family foundation said that in a true death spiral, the people buying insurance on the exchanges should be a progressively sicker group of people each year. although the people buying insurance have been sicker than insurers projected, cox said there isn't evidence that the pool of people is getting sicker.\n\nad\n\none sign of a death spiral would be fewer young adults, who tend to be healthier, signing up -- something that cox says hasn't happened. another protection against a death spiral is that roughly 85 percent of the people who buy insurance through the exchanges are insulated from premium increases by subsidies, she said.\n\nad\n\nbetween the subsidies the people are getting, the continued strong enrollment, generally, and the fact we haven't seen a significant drop off in the young adult age range -- those are the signs we're not really seeing a death spiral yet, cox said.\n\nthe trump administration introduced a proposed rule wednesday that includes provisions aimed at addressing one of insurers' complaints about obamacare -- the special enrollment periods that allow people to sign up for health coverage outside of the open enrollment period. insurers have complained that people wait until they are sick to sign up for health coverage, and the proposed rule would require people to supply documentation that they are eligible to enroll.\n\nad\n\nobamacare has failed -- harming patients and making it harder for families to make ends meet, health and human services secretary tom price wrote in a statement announcing actions the administration was taking in advance of a broader effort to reverse the harmful effects of obamacare.\n\nad\n\nalthough the big national insurers are large companies, they haven't been the biggest players in the exchanges, where 9.2 million people signed up through healthcare.gov. at the end of january, aetna reported 240,000 members through its state exchanges in delaware, iowa, nebraska and virginia. humana, which is pulling out of all the exchanges next year, insures about 150,000 people through its state exchanges.\n\naetna lost $450 million in the aca's exchanges last year and has cited those financial losses as the reason it slashed its marketplace participation for 2017, pulling out of 11 states. but u.s. district court judge john d. bates, who blocked the aetna-humana merger in january, found that wasn't the only reason. bates wrote in his opinion that the company exited some markets to improve the chance that the merger would be approved. in florida, the exchange business had been profitable, and the decision to leave that state was motivated by an attempt to avoid antitrust scrutiny, bates wrote.\n\nasked about the judge's assessment of aetna's motivations, bertolini said that he had 450 million reasons to get out of the exchanges, referring to the company's financial losses. he indicated that without withdrawing, the company projected greater losses, of $800 million to $900 million.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe said that it was a company-damaging move to lose $1 billion a year. aetna will pay humana a $1 billion breakup fee as part of its merger agreement.\n\nbertolini spoke at length about the need to transform the health-care system and care for people before they are acutely sick. smarter interventions could lead to better outcomes and lower costs, he argued. and he said high drug prices aren't always a problem. he pointed to the new generation of hepatitis c therapies, which can cure the disease but are expensive — and argued that curing hepatitis c is better than waiting to pay for a liver transplant.\n\nhe argued that, instead, it was necessary to talk about the value of drugs and to reexamine the role of middlemen between the drug company and the patient — such as pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate on behalf of insurance companies, wholesalers and pharmacists — which each take a cut of the price.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nhe said that pharmacy benefit managers play an essential role, but that they don't need to be independent entities, with their own profit margins.\n\ncorrection: this story has been updated to correct aetna chief executive mark bertolini's comment that aetna is the only insurer operating on the nebraska exchange. medica also offers insurance there. aetna said bertolini misspoke.
the measure – included by democrats in the sweeping coronavirus legislation they're trying to soon pass – is a key way president biden and democrats are hoping to further expand health coverage, after the 2010 affordable care act made progress toward that end but still fell short of closing the uninsured gap. about 33 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, and more have probably joined their ranks since then amid pandemic-related job losses.\n\nyet the cost is more per person than the government spends to insure people through its major insurance programs, medicare and medicaid — and illustrates just how expensive it is to rely on the nation's for-profit insurance industry to get americans covered.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is one of the most expensive ways to expand coverage, said cynthia cox, an affordable care act expert at the kaiser family foundation who has analyzed the proposal.\n\nthe coverage expansions wouldn't last, either. unless congress extended the timeline, the subsidies would return to current levels after two years. by 2023, the uninsured rate would return to current levels, the cbo said.\n\nyet the selling point remains: enhancing subsidies will help more people get covered.\n\nand the move would particularly help those likely to have lost income during the pandemic who are buying marketplace coverage because they don't have it through their workplaces.\n\nad\n\nthe measure, which is included in both the house and senate bills, would lower the amount of income people are expected to spend on monthly premiums.\n\nad\n\nfor example, someone at 200 percent of the federal poverty level wouldn't have to spend more than 2 percent of their income on premiums. those earning 150 percent or less wouldn't have to pay anything. and, for the first time, earners at or above 400 percent of the federal poverty level would be eligible for income-pegged subsidies.\n\nit's also feasible that more people entering the marketplaces could help insurers lower premiums in subsequent years.\n\nit's possible the additional subsidies could persuade more people to buy plans than the cbo is estimating, especially considering that healthcare.gov is open for a special enrollment period because of the pandemic.\n\nearlier this week, the biden administration announced it is restoring a modest amount of funds for community groups to help people enroll. the trump administration had slashed funding for these marketplace navigators.\n\nso for democrats, expanding the subsidies is a no-brainer.\n\nafter spending the 2020 campaign promising to make health coverage more affordable, they're happy to pass legislation helping to fulfill that pledge. and they can make the case that helping people get covered is more essential than ever during the pandemic.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nplus, the cost of the provision is flying under the radar amid the broader debate in congress over the $1.9 trillion relief package.\n\ni don't know if people will be willing to admit it's not a bang for buck, said chris condeluci, former counsel for the senate finance committee and founder of a policy firm focused on the aca.\n\nrepublicans are happy to argue the federal government won't be getting more bang for its buck.\n\ngop members are already annoyed by the costs of the coronavirus relief package, which democrats are moving using filibuster-proof legislation to avoid seeking any republican help. they've been arguing that much of the legislation isn't directly related to the pandemic, instead reflecting broader liberal priorities such as raising the minimum wage.\n\nad\n\nsen. john barrasso (r-wyo.) slammed the expanded subsidies during a floor speech yesterday, saying democrats would just increase government payments without tackling the heart of the issue, which is health-care costs.\n\nad\n\nthis bill would now subsidize health insurance far beyond what was ever imagined when the house and the senate passed the obama health-care law — way beyond the subsidies ever envisioned in that, barrasso said.\n\nsenate majority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) says the senate will move on the package as soon as today.\n\nwe'll have the votes we need to pass the bill, schumer pledged yesterday.\n\nhis comments came even as moderate senate democrats maneuvered to limit some of the expenditures in the bill, over objections from liberals who insisted they had already made concessions on biden's first major legislative proposal, the post's erica werner reports.\n\nbut senate minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said he hoped in the end senate republicans will unanimously oppose it, just like house republicans did when the legislation passed the house on saturday with no gop support.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nthis is a wildly expensive proposal largely unrelated to the problem, mcconnell said. we think this package should have been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. … instead, the new administration made a conscious decision to jam us.\n\ndemocrats can't afford to lose a single vote.\n\nschumer intends to have vice president harris cast the tiebreaking vote, but first he needs to ensure all 50 members of his caucus are on hand to vote yes. that hasn't always been the case this year, paul kane notes.\n\nin late january, sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) fell ill and was briefly hospitalized. a day later, sen. mark warner (d-va.) went into quarantine for a few days after coming in close contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nboth senators returned to work quickly, but their brief absence served as a stark reminder of just how perilous the democratic majority is in a 50-50 senate, particularly as they plan to push through a $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package later this week, paul writes. if one democrat has a fever, breaks an ankle or takes a bad fall, the legislative process would come to a stop until all 50 were able to vote for president biden's first critical legislative agenda item.\n\nahh, oof and ouch\n\nahh: biden says the u.s. will have enough vaccine doses for every adult in america by may.\n\nthe new may target is two months earlier than the administration's previous goal of having enough vaccine doses for every adult by july. the accelerated timeline reflects new confidence from the administration in production schedules from the nation's vaccine makers, the post's christopher rowland and laurie mcginley report.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nmsnbc's chris hayes:\n\nbiden hailed a commitment from pharmaceutical giant merck to help make johnson & johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine, comparing it to world war ii efforts. the administration also said johnson & johnson and its contract manufacturers would move to a round-the-clock production schedule.\n\njohnson & johnson's latest goal is to produce 94 million doses of its single-shot vaccine by the end of may. together with the pledged shots from pfizer and moderna — 200 million doses each of their two-shot vaccines — this should be more than enough for the estimated 260 million adults eligible for a vaccine.\n\ncurrently, more than 100 million vaccine doses have been shipped around the u.s., with more than 50 million people receiving at least one shot, according to the post's vaccine tracker.\n\nbiden said he'll use the federal government's pharmacy program to prioritize k-12 teachers for vaccinations and will also call on states to prioritize educators. the president said that his goal is for every educator to receive at least a first dose of a vaccine by the end of march.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nwidespread vaccinations could herald the beginning of a gradual return to normal life. politico reports the centers for disease control and prevention is set to release guidelines on safe activities for people who have been fully vaccinated as soon as tomorrow. the guidance will recommend that vaccinated americans limit their social interactions to small gatherings in the home with other vaccinated individuals and that they continue to wear masks in public.\n\noof: texas and mississippi are lifting their mask mandates.\n\ntexas gov. greg abbott's order to lift the state's mask requirement and increase the permitted capacity of all businesses to 100 percent prompted sharp criticism tuesday from health experts and government officials who deemed it irresponsible and premature, the post's erin cunningham, derek hawkins and paulina villegas report.\n\nad\n\nad\n\nabbott (r) said that his order, which will go into effect march 10, is the result of new vaccines and therapeutics to combat the virus. but the decision comes as health officials warn about the spread of new, more transmissible variants of the coronavirus.\n\nmississippi gov. tate reeves (r) made a similar announcement on twitter.\n\nwhile the united states saw a steady decline in cases and hospitalizations since a peak in late january, that downward trend has stalled in recent days, and cases have actually began to inch up in some places.\n\nouch: the cdc says states should prioritize vaccinations for people with disabilities.\n\nthe cdc's new guidance is part of the agency's latest recommendations for distributing the three approved coronavirus vaccines, the post's lena h. sun reports. the health agency urged states to consider the unique needs of people with disabilities or cognitive decline and their caretakers, and those with limited access to technology, as appointments open to new groups.\n\nthe one-shot johnson & johnson vaccine, which does not need to be kept frozen, might be best for people who want to be immunized quickly or would have difficulty returning for a second shot, the cdc said. the agency cited people who move frequently or who live or work in homeless shelters or correctional facilities as good candidates for that shot.\n\nexperts say that the new guidance reflects a growing concern about how to reach people who may face barriers to access, including those with disabilities or people who may struggle to sign up for vaccine appointments online.\n\nmore in coronavirus news\n\na new federal report says the trump administration failed to uphold safety protections for workers.\n\nthe occupational safety and health administration's failure to issue new rules about coronavirus safety that companies would have been required to follow left workers unsafe, the labor department's office of inspector general said in a new report. osha also performed significantly fewer workplace safety inspections during the pandemic despite receiving more complaints compared with the same period in 2019, the post's eli rosenberg reports.\n\nthe united states has not studied the issue nationally, but workplace transmission has made for a significant portion of the infections across the country. hundreds of thousands of essential workers in industries such as health care, groceries, warehouses and meatpacking have been infected with the virus, and tens of thousands have died, eli writes.\n\nwe are concerned that since most osha inspections were done remotely during the pandemic, hazards may go unidentified and unabated longer, with employees being more vulnerable to hazardous risk exposure while working, the inspector general wrote.\n\nthe report bolstered the case of labor unions and advocates for workers who argued that the trump administration left workers at risk during the pandemic.\n\nelsewhere in health care\n\nthe senate finance committee will vote today on california attorney general xavier becerra's confirmation as health secretary.\n\nbecerra is expected to win approval in the committee, which will clear the way for his consideration by the full senate, reuters reports. the committee will also vote on biden's nomination of katherine tai as trade czar and wally adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary.\n\nbecerra's confirmation hearing before the senate finance committee was marked by sharp exchanges over abortion, with republican lawmakers questioning whether his involvement in litigation on reproductive health issues would present a conflict of interest. gop senators also pressed the nominee on his previous support for medicare-for-all.\n\nfive weeks after their last day in office, the trump administration health officials who stayed to the end are now popping up in new roles.\n\nper our colleague dan diamond:\n\nbrad smith — who led medicare's innovation center and served as a top white house health policy official — has launched russell street ventures, the tennessean reported on tuesday. the firm is focused on creating or incubating health care companies that focus on serving vulnerable patients; the leadership team includes rachel baitel, a trump white house veteran, and eric hargarten and kara pitts, who did stints at cms working with smith.\n\nbrian harrison, the former hhs chief of staff, this week unveiled his campaign for congress in texas' sixth congressional district. catherine bird, who worked closely with harrison in senior hhs roles, is pitching in on the campaign.\n\nmeanwhile, paul mango, who served as deputy chief of staff, has started a consulting operation called jackson hole strategic advisors and has joined several boards, mango told dan.\n\nsome of the most visible trump health officials, like jerome adams, the former surgeon general, and alex azar, the former hhs secretary, have yet to announce new ventures. a person familiar with azar's thinking says he's intentionally taking his time.\n\nmichigan's former health director got a payout in a confidential separation agreement.\n\nmichigan gov. gretchen whitmer's administration agreed to pay former state health department director robert gordon $155,506 as part of an agreement that prohibited the two parties from disclosing information about the circumstances that led to his abrupt departure in january.\n\nthe agreement is the clearest evidence yet that the split between gordon, a central figure in the state's response to covid-19, and whitmer was not amicable, and it shows the democratic administration used taxpayer funds to ease his departure, the detroit news's craig mauger reports.\n\ngordon's resignation came less than eight hours after he lifted the coronavirus-related suspension on indoor dining in restaurants. both he and whitmer have refused to say why he stepped down.
