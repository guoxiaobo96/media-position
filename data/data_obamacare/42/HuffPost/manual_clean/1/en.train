{"original": "Economic Opportunity: The Great Recession decimated Latino families' wealth. In virtually every Latino community in the United States, the contraction of the economy meant lay-offs, increased indebtedness and diminished home values. As the economy has slowly begun to recover, so too have some Latino families. But the impact of the financial crisis has had powerful consequences on Latino households and all too many families find themselves barely getting by. Homeownership rates among Latino families are still well below where they were in the pre-recession years. The next president has the power to make an immediate difference in the lives of these struggling families. An important first step would be a commitment to making major federal investments in creating new, good-paying jobs in the energy sector, manufacturing and construction industries, and workforce training programs that will allow Latinos and other marginalized workers the opportunity to fairly compete for these jobs. Additionally, the next president must push for legislation that guarantees pay equality for America's women. Latinas are paid just 54 cents on the dollar compared to non-Hispanic White workers. Latinos want a candidate to provide clear policy proposals that promote greater economic security and mobility, including opportunities to grow small businesses, increase homeownership, participate in job training initiatives and strengthen income support programs.", "augmented": []}

Obama allowed plans to vary within their metal level by 2 percentage points in either direction. Trump will give them more leeway.

This has a side effect of potentially lowering the value of the tax credit subsidies for premiums, because they're based in part on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each geographic area.

According to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Americans surveyed said they blamed Congress as a whole, with equal blame going to Democrats and Republicans (and less to Trump). That shutdown was precipitated by Senate Democrats trying to incorporate into budget negotiations a deal to help the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Shutdowns often don't have long-term electoral consequences, though. In the 1996 and 2014 congressional elections, Republicans made gains, despite shouldering most of the blame for recent shutdowns.

Abortion pills are more private, more portable, and offer more flexibility in timing. The pills are also less medically invasive than performing a traditional in-office abortion procedure. It has been proven internationally in countries like India, Mozambique, and Ethiopia that women can be provided these medications by nurse midwives, pharmacists, and other less traditional means and are then able to use them successfully and safely as an alternative to a mandatory visit to the physician's office. If abortion providers continue to lose ground due to political opposition in the U.S., these experiences overseas may be a helpful path for ongoing access to abortion care for women in our own country.", "augmented": []}

When Bernie's campaign became competitive, his goals and prescriptions for what America needed were given a pat on the head and dismissed as well-meaning but naïve idealism. Later, Hillary characterized Bernie's proposals as pie in the sky stuff meant to trick young people to vote for him with promises of free stuff, continuing the characterization of Bernie supporters as mostly dumb children (literally or just intellectually) who don't do their research, think for themselves, or understand politics, the issues, or how the real world works, and are thus deserving of Hillary's pity. And, of course, there was the infamous double-barrel blast of feminist icon Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- both Hillary supporters -- who respectively characterized young women who support Bernie as simply being boy crazy (since, as Steinem said, The boys are with Bernie,) and earning themselves a special place in Hell for not supporting another woman (both later apologized).

In trying to address the discrepancies, the patient was often unable to clarify whether the therapists had neglected the paperwork or the insurance company had mislaid the submission.

I know from twenty-one years of experience that the city is so much more than a smoggy, sweaty, summer-smothering inferno, it's more than Wall Street, and it's more than its top five most Instagrammable restaurants. And yet, my time did seem to condense into a consciousness marked only by the pendulum that swings between the workweek and the weekend. Few people have captured this rhythm as well as Mark Sebastian in his repetitive chorus for the Lovin' Spoonful's hit Summer in the City. The song's depiction of struggling to 'make it' in Greenwich Village in the heat of July is as accurate today as it was then in 1966. This summer's college interns were hardly the first and certainly not the last to feel discouraged, drenched in sweat, on the streets of Manhattan. It is only through being absorbed within the tiny intern world that have I been able to fully understand this greater, so often clichéd truth: perseverance in the face of obstacles is what the city is all about.

The Fund expires in 2018 and Latinos will be looking to the White House to lead the charge on reauthorization. Another key issue area for Latinos is climate change. Latinos disproportionately suffer its effects because we are much more likely to work outdoors than not, and because many of us live in coastal areas.

A 10 percent increase in taxes didn't seem to make sense, especially since that would only cover needs for subsequent years if there were no cost increases. Cruz's plan, establishing high-risk pools, has also been tried. Since the AIDS crisis, high-risk pools have been available to allow people with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage.
