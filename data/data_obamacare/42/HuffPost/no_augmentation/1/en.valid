As with past weeks, presiding over Pruitt's assault on the environment, the GOP Congress's assault on health care, Devos's assault on students, and other policy outrages hasn't been enough for Donald J. Trump, who must always deliver his own personal brand of kleptocratic, misogynistic, narcissistic, and Putinistic disgracefulness.
AOL Trump's former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo aboard.
I did not vote for you. Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life. I proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you -- particularly the ACA, wrote Brent Nathan Brown of Mosinee, Wisconsin. I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn't vote for you. Brown also introduced Obama at the event.
This new, have-it-every-which-way approach pushes the extremely challenging implementation of the Medicare for All part of this plan ten years into the future, meaning it would not occur on the watch of even a two-term administration, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. The result? A Bernie Sanders-lite Medicare for All and a refusal to be straight with the American middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.
Across the industry, hospital jobs so far in 2017 grew by 8,775 monthly on average, compared to 11,413 jobs for the same period last year, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. (Graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2mtyO0w)
The Trump administration guidance means that it can interpret the law's rules more loosely, in ways that will effectively let people move into less comprehensive coverage ― even though that means more exposure to medical bills.
It was a starter home. It's been vandalized. And people at times tried to undermine its foundations. But it's held up.
Trump's plan also increases the federal budget deficit and the national debt. The plan Trump has proposed, which was set out as a one-page proposal without any financial justification to back it up, never stated anything at all about how the federal budget will be impacted nor how the national debt either increases or decreases. According to the analysts from the Tax Policy Center, federal revenue is estimated to decrease by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years. The Trump economic team should hope that there will be the 4 percent economic growth they projected that will make up for the federal revenue decrease. But if there is a recession or economic downturn, then Trump's proposal will suffer serious consequences.
Gaffney was actually one of the witnesses that single-payer advocates put forward to testify. But the Rules Committee nixed his appearance, along with those of more than a dozen other suggested witnesses.
Beyond the provisions on pre-existing conditions, if Republicans keep control of Congress next year, they will come for the Affordable Care Act again. But they still don't have a replacement plan that would protect people with pre-existing conditions or do any of the other things the Affordable Care Act did to slash the rate of uninsured Americans.
Harris' plan takes a middle-of-road approach, falling short of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sweeping plan to completely overhaul the nation's health insurance system, yet offering a bigger transformation to the nation's health care system than the reforms supported by former Vice President Joe Biden.
Ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give Trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said Tyler, the former campaign aide to Cruz.
We're now almost 10 years into it, so I deal with the world we're in, and so let's figure out an offramp that addresses some of the underlying issues about the cost of health care while also providing more access to health insurance for people on the individual market that still can't afford health insurance that have preexisting conditions, McSally said.
They understood that the death panel charge had always been a lie ― that it was Obamacare's opponents, not its supporters, who were threatening the medically vulnerable.
Sessions also took a break from his work to help Trump's private prison owner donors, and to hurt gravely ill people who depend on medical marijuana, to appear last Friday on the morning show Fox & Friends. Despite his announced decision to recuse himself from the Russiagate investigation, Sessions offered thoughts on the Russiagate investigation, including, when pressed by the Fox hosts about concerns that special counsel Robert Mueller has hired lawyers connected to Democratic politics, this comment: Well, Mr. Mueller, is entitled, lawfully, I guess at this point, to hire who he desires, but I think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people. Fairly bland, but a less disgraceful attorney general could have said, I'm recused from this matter so I can't comment on it. Especially since a March 2 memo from Jody Hunt, Sessions' chief of staff, said the AG's commitment to recuse on the investigation covers speaking with the media: The Attorney General's recusal is not only with respect to such investigations, if any, but also extends to Department responses to Congressional and media inquiries related to any such investigations. George W. Bush White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter flatly told Politico that Sessions should not be doing this.
In the moments after it was announced that his health care bill was dead and pulled from consideration, President Donald Trump had pinpointed the culprit. Democrats, he explained, were to blame for the failure because they refused to provide him with any of their votes.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and current Speaker Paul Ryan, for example, built their conservative reputations and bases of power with sweeping plans to dismantle the federal safety net, and they have many acolytes. The main difference between those GOP leaders and President Donald Trump is that the latter is even more brazen in his lies about what he plans to do.
Trump's call-in on a 2014 Fox & Friends episode, which was posted Thursday by Raw Story, appears to reveal his willingness to tolerate almost any disaster to get what he wants.
Joe Biden aided and abetted China's rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers, Cotton said.
It's a head-scratching political move. During an election year that's shaping up to be a disaster for the Republican Party, its national leader and prominent officials around the country are taking a strong stand against enabling sick people to go to the doctor.
Biden does not support defunding the police. Biden has actually proposed increased federal funding for police departments to hire additional officers, while Trump has proposed cutting federal funds for local departments in each of the budgets of his presidency.
Unless that changes, the outcome will depend on the Supreme Court, where nothing is guaranteed.
There are four people testifying for Democrats: Sara Collins from the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund; Dr. Doris Browne, the former president of the National Medical Association; Dr. Farzon Nahvi, an emergency physician and professor in New York City; and Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
There's no evidence that Trump cares about health care at all beyond his intense desire to undo anything President Barack Obama did in office. Has there been anything about Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic to suggest that the health and well-being of Americans is a priority for him? Two hundred thousand dead say otherwise.
If Sanders or other national Democratic leaders are going to bring national attention to Republican policies in the state that have led to hospital closures and higher utility bills, Robertson said, Let 'em come.
The dreaded trial didn't happen! Another anti-climax. Hurray! Bring 'em on. Nothing like dashed expectations in a gorgeous setting to get the heart racing.
There are plenty of other reasons the speech's effect will be limited: The inappropriate use of the White House and lack of social distancing among the Rose Garden crowd will overshadow the speech's content, and two bigger news stories ― the aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast ― may overshadow its existence entirely.
By the middle of 2009, Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative South Carolina Republican who had riled up Tea Party activists by promising that defeating reform would be Obama's Waterloo, was setting the tone on health care. Grassley, facing the threat of a conservative primary challenge, started talking about death panels at events back home. And in a meeting Obama later described in his memoir, the Iowa senator told the former president there was no concession that would win his vote.
It's hard to draw a direct cause and effect, Call said. They don't ask you why you're disenrolling.
But the new statements from Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to President Donald Trump, come with all the usual caveats.
The Trump administration is not the first to drop the defense of a federal law. But when past administrations have decided against defending a law, they have generally argued that a case raised highly important moral issues ― or was clearly unconstitutional.
It's not hard to see why Republicans would try to cast themselves as guardians against rising crime in some cities ― to say nothing of the rioting that has spilled out from peaceful demonstrations against police misconduct, particularly in cities like Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Kenosha, Wisconsin. That's because it allows the GOP to shift from the politically inconvenient terrain of dismissing protests against police misconduct and racism, which a majority of Americans support, and turn to the stronger ground of condemning arson and property destruction, which already appear to be turning swing voters against Democrats in the general election battleground state of Wisconsin.
Polls have shown repeatedly that Medicare for All's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether.
For a lot of years, the threat against women's health care has been talked about, but they've never been as real as they are today, said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who works on health care. It's changed from a coffee table conversation to a clear and present danger. That means voters can no longer stay with Republicans and assume that this won't become an issue.
But Monday's rule change almost certainly means that, overall, people with serious medical problems are likely to have a harder time finding coverage ― and, ultimately, paying their medical bills.
But in Iowa last month, conservative Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds resisted calls to shut down plants with severe coronavirus outbreaks. Patience Roggensack, the conservative chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, questioned the state's shutdown order because the big spike in illness was among meatpacking workers (often immigrants), and not and the regular folks.
And if Trump was woefully ill-informed about the Iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, they tracked congressional Republicans' attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the GOP nomination, which were then further escalated by Fox News hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.
His appeal has yet to be tested in a field with several strong candidates ― a field that may well include Harris along with Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and former Vice President Joe Biden.
This is a shameful decision from the Supreme Court, said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Denying employees and students coverage for birth control will limit their ability to decide whether and when to have a family and make other decisions about their futures. And it will exacerbate existing inequalities, falling hardest on people with the fewest resources and people of color.
That keeps many from signing up for food stamps and other public assistance even when they're eligible, said Monestel, who has lived here for decades as a legal permanent resident.
Trump Sees China As Joe Biden's Weak Point
We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats, Trump explained. With no Democrats on board, we couldn't quite get there.
No, he said quickly, because it passed, and 20 million people got health insurance, and it's still there. Then he paused, opened his eyes a bit wider, and started up again: But I think what it does reveal is some major structural problems in our current political system that make it much harder to do big things than it used to be.
WASHINGTON -- Twenty million previously uninsured people have gained health coverage since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, President Barack Obama said during a speech in Milwaukee Thursday.
Three years ago, when I was in South Carolina and other states campaigning, my opponent and editorial writers all across the country ... they said, 'Bernie Sanders is nuts. He is far out. His ideas are extreme. Nobody supports those wild ideas,' he said with a mock sense of alarm. Well, guess what happened folks? Three years have come and gone, and those ideas that were seen to be radical and extreme three years ago are today mainstream, supported by the vast majority of America.
If the administration takes such action, it's likely that fewer people would pay a financial penalty for not having health insurance, but people who hold onto their coverage would face higher premiums. In addition, the number of people without coverage would rise, maybe even dramatically.
Trump's promise to rip up the Iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.
In keeping with Sanders' base-centric approach to turning his campaign's tide, he stuck to his standard populist script on Wednesday, mixing moral denunciations of corporate greed with snarky asides and paeans to the social democratic reforms of the mid-20th century. He insisted that the current health care system, in which millions of Americans go without the care they need as insurance executives earn multimillion-dollar compensation packages, is the result of corporate capture of the political system.
Trump also turned a holiday concert that was supposed to salute service members and veterans into a tribute to himself, gloating that the fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not.
The answers from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump provided a near-perfect distillation of very different ways they think about the world ― and how, most likely, they would govern as president.

Unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, Larry Levitt, who runs health policy at KFF, said in a statement. As unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA will move into the Medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.
The boisterous health care rally showed the unique position Sanders occupies within the already-crowded field of rumored 2020 presidential contenders: He's done it before and he has the organizational muscle to show for it, even in a state like South Carolina where he fared poorly in '16.
The new figures HHS published Thursday show the uninsured rate improved across racial and ethnic groups.
Spratt truly sounded as if he was about to swallow his own lips when Denker turned the tables on him. Wouldn't that be amazing--if he got fired, he could join a circus!

You know what solves it? Trump asked, referring to Obamacare. When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster — then you'll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.

An Effect That The Numbers Don't Reveal
Republic Report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of President Donald J. Trump. Trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.
In addition, CBO said, the proportion of Americans without health insurance would rise even more dramatically ― by 18 million, which is roughly the number of people who have gotten coverage through the law, according to the most reliable estimates.
It's always exciting when national figures localize our issues, he added.
President Donald Trump's promised breakthrough in health care coverage looks like it could be insurance protection for preexisting conditions. One sticking point: It's already guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act — which his administration is fighting to kill in the Supreme Court.
If the Republican plaintiffs win ― an outcome made more likely by the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week ― an estimated 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and everyone with a preexisting condition, no matter how minor, would be at risk.
Greg Ip wrote a fascinating, extremely well-researched and only marginally biased article in the Wall Street Journal entitled The Unstable Economics in Obama's Health Law. As a healthcare provider as well as an Affordable Care Act participant, I was sent this article because I have been researching possible solutions to the LOSE-LOSE-LOSE debacle that Obamacare has become.
Tom Williams via Getty Images There's wariness that the hearing on Medicare for All could end up supporting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's position that the best way forward is to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act.
Tuesday's oral arguments will offer the first hints of how she and the rest of the justices view this case, although an actual ruling will likely wait several months, maybe even until the spring.
An estimated 4 million Hispanics aged 18-64 gained coverage, and the share without insurance fell from 41.8 percent to 30.5 percent. Among working-age African-American adults, the uninsured rate declined from 22.4 percent to 10.6 percent as 3 million got covered. And the proportion of non-Hispanic whites without coverage went down from 14.3 percent to 7 percent as a result of 8.9 million adults between 18 and 64 becoming insured.
With Obamacare repeal off the legislative agenda ― for now, at least ― why would these senators write legislation to solve a problem that doesn't exist? Because their party is the middle of unsolving it.

After a standing-room-only rally over the weekend at Iowa State, Sanders, Scholten and Iowa Secretary of State candidate Deidre DeJear headed to the school's sports complex to shoot some hoops for the cameras.
It's unclear who decided which experts would testify before the Rules Committee. Staffers on the Rules Committee say no one in leadership directly told them this person or that person couldn't testify, but sources involved with the planning of the hearing say three criteria were applied to potential witnesses: (1) Is this person a leader of a single-payer group? If so, that person could not testify ― meaning Gaffney was out. (2) Is this person an activist? If so, they couldn't testify. That meant people like Dr. Sanjeev Sriram, who has repeatedly advocated for Medicare for All, were ruled out. And (3) Has this person said anything negative about the Affordable Care Act?

Sanders congratulated Biden from a rally in Virginia Beach on Saturday night, telling his supporters that you can't win them all. His campaign said it was confident in its ability to meet the threshold to win some delegates in South Carolina, but already had set its sights on Super Tuesday. Sanders spent the last week campaigning in California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Although the success of this approach has yet to manifest itself in the polls, Harris, in particular, has provided Sanders ample fodder to distinguish himself as a more genuine champion of single-payer health care.
Those kinds of compromises are frequently deflating. That doesn't mean they should be, and the Affordable Care Act is an example of why. It still achieved a lot ― more, in fact, than even many liberals seem to grasp. It's already transformed the political conversation on health care, so that the principles of universal coverage now have wide acceptance.
Single-payer groups and activists are reflexively suspicious of Primus after The Intercept revealed that he had spoken to insurance executives and laid out his own objections to Medicare for All.
KC McGinnis / Reuters Sen. Kamala Harris of California is among other Democrats viewed as a presidential contender in 2020.
McCaughey, already notorious for dishonest attacks on President Bill Clinton from a decade before, was engaging in wild distortion. The provision merely required that Medicare pay for counseling sessions on how to write advance directives. That way, physicians would be able to carve out the time for seniors who wanted help making decisions about end-of-life care in the future.
Ben Marter, a spokesman for Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), noted that Trump had called the Post and the Times today to discuss health care reform defeats, but not us.
Republican officials, who have spent the last eight-plus years trying to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act and its provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions, have in recent weeks been saying they are not actually doing the things they are doing.
Pelosi herself has repeatedly refused to endorse a Medicare for All approach to health care, insisting instead that the best way forward is to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act. And even though the single-payer advocates we spoke to this week emphasized the importance of this hearing, there's wariness that the meeting could end up supporting Pelosi's position.
Why did Aetna agree to a deal that included a $1 billion break-up fee? When the company agreed to this condition, did Aetna conduct an internal assessment of the risk of a DOJ challenge? When Aetna agreed to pay this fee, was Aetna aware that it would endanger participation in the ACA exchanges?
Public opinion data suggests why some Democrats remain hesitant about embracing an entirely government-run health care program. Polls have shown repeatedly that Medicare for All's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether. When asked in a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll to choose between Medicare for All and proposals that augment the Affordable Care Act, for example, 36% of Democrats chose Medicare for All and 57% preferred plans that build upon Obamacare.
The failure to pass the bill represents a devastating defeat for Trump and Ryan ― and throws into doubt a crusade that has defined Republican politics for over seven years.
But for now, Republicans aren't interested in another health care fight.
It's a complicated set of changes, but it means that some residents of states seeking the waivers could end up with easier access to cheaper, skimpier health plans, providing an alternative to those who cannot afford to pay for comprehensive coverage that the Affordable Care Act has made available.
Verma, who addressed reporters in a conference call Monday, insisted that the new rules would not hurt people with pre-existing conditions. In so doing, she echoed claims that Trump and countless Republican candidates for federal and state office have made with increasing insistence over the past few weeks, as their longstanding support for repealing the Affordable Care Act has become a clear, possibly fatal political liability.
These attacks were especially galling to reform proponents because it was the opposite of what they were trying to do.
Next year, navigators from across the country will have to apply and compete for a total of $10 million in funds. That's down from $37 million for the 2018 plan year and from $63 million for 2017. The Trump administration has made similarly sharp reductions in funds earmarked for advertising and promoting health insurance enrollment.
King, along with Sanders campaign co-chair and former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner and activist Philip Agnew, spent this past weekend going to barbershops and universities to rally Black voters for Sanders.
As vice president, Biden was reportedly reluctant to pursue Obamacare. As a senator, he played a key role in writing and passing policies, such as harsh penalties for drug possession, that led to today's criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes minorities. And he backed the Iraq War, while Obama's opposition to the invasion was a key issue that propelled him ahead of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.
If the Republican plaintiffs win ― an outcome made more likely by the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week ― an estimated 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and everyone with a preexisting condition, no matter how minor, would be at risk.
But none of that would compare to knocking out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as this new lawsuit could do.
But Sanders has since taken pains to court black allies, champion policies outside of what are often strictly defined as economic justice issues and incorporate them into his stump speech. He can no longer be fairly depicted as a politician narrowly focused on economic or class issues.
So in that context, it makes sense that these senators would want to have a bill they can cite as evidence that they don't think people with pre-existing conditions should be excluded from the health care system. The legislation doesn't actually do that, but it's enough for a campaign ad.
Three political appointees at Justice, along with one other career lawyer, ended up signing onto the federal government's brief. In court, they will square off against lawyers from states more supportive of the law and who have agreed to defend it.

Likewise, a number of pilot programs to reengineer Medicare payments for health care, in order to improve the program's efficiency and promote better quality care, are now underway. The experiments are taking place through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which the Affordable Care Act authorizes and finances.
There's a lot of things at play right now that are not left or right ― they're Iowa issues, he said. It's our tariffs, it's these farmlands all around us.
Rather than replace the ACA and traditional Medicare with something less reliable, as Biden suggests, Sanders' legislation would enroll everyone in an expanded version of Medicare that covers vision and dental care, and no longer costs Americans anything at the point of service.
To process what the candidates were saying, it helps to get an accurate picture of what's actually happening with Obamacare these days.
Late this week, Trump and GOP leaders agreed to modify the bill by eliminating a requirement that all insurance plans cover essential benefits, such as mental health and maternity care, and then offering special funds to cover the costs of precisely those services. Experts immediately warned that making these changes could dramatically alter health insurance markets, making it difficult to find comprehensive coverage as insurers would gravitate toward offering less generous policies.
GOP voters remain loyal to the president. And not by small margins. While just 39 percent of all respondents in a recent Pew poll said they approved of the job Trump was doing, 84 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they felt that way. GOP support for Trump surpasses that for George W. Bush, his father, and Ronald Reagan at similar points in their presidencies.
Health insurance companies are struggling to make money on the exchanges, leading major players like UnitedHealth Group to openly contemplate abandoning them. Aetna and other firms, in contrast, say they're committed to making the marketplaces work even if they're not immediately profitable. And insurers losing money in the exchange market are eyeing premium increases for next year that could make coverage unaffordable for some portion of those already in the system.
Trump said he agreed to pulling the bill once Ryan made it clear the legislation lacked the votes to pass.
Those findings, which the CBO published early last week, halted the political momentum the repeal legislation had gained when it sailed through two committee votes earlier this month. As Trump administration officials and House Republicans began preparing for consideration by the full House, they quickly realized the bill lacked enough support to pass.
These numbers have fed the perception that Trump is a sui generis type of political figure ― one whose avid base will stick by him regardless of foible or misstep. It's a perception that Trump himself has pushed, famously declaring that he could stand in the Middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any votes.
The Trump administration's campaign to undermine the Affordable Care Act notched another achievement Tuesday.
As for the current health care law, on which some 20 million people depend for insurance, its odds of survival seem better than at any time since Trump's election, when its repeal seemed nearly inevitable.
A short film of racially diverse residents of New York City's public housing system denounced the incompetence of Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio. One speaker even denounced Democrats for putting illegal immigrants before Black Americans.

While Republicans won back the House in 2010 with a message focused, at least in part, on outrage over wasteful government spending, it's unclear if that message will work as well with the party's culture war-focused Trump-era coalition, which includes more voters without a college degree. (The Pew survey found lower-income Republicans were more likely to support the Rescue Act then their wealthier counterparts were.)

Denver Health is not alone. Across the country, hospitals are shifting to a more conservative stance as they await sweeping changes to the nation's healthcare law that for the first time in U.S. history would reverse a government healthcare entitlement program. The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, provided coverage to 20 million Americans and brought higher revenues to many hospitals.

Betsy McCaughey built a career out of saying bombastic, completely false things about health care reform. She is reviled by actual health care policy analysts from the left, right and center for spreading frightening, but demonstrably false, misinformation while adopting the tone and posture of a serious expert.
A key change in individual taxes could occur with the revision of tax brackets. Trump's proposal calls for reducing tax brackets for individuals from seven to three set at 10, 25, and 35 percent. According to The Wall Street Journal, this reduces the amount of taxes on individual income for those earning over $699,000 by $214,000, while their ultimate share of all federal taxes reduces to 25 percent. This will benefit the wealthy since the top tax rate decreases from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.
Researchers looked at Latino enrollment in food stamps between 2006 and 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. They found that after the federal government began stepping up deportation efforts, Latino immigrant enrollment in SNAP and the ACA dropped. (The ACA wasn't passed until 2010, and went into effect in 2014.)
Right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving Iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash.

Dakota Workman, 22, from West Virginia, said the White House was not operating, as Trump insisted, like a fine-tuned machine, though he noted that no administration is this early on. But he appreciated the new coal regulations, the ban on lobbying and Trump's Supreme Court pick even more. If the president backpedaled on Obamacare repeal, he said, he'd be upset with Congress and start thinking about ditching Trump. I sucked up my pride and voted for him more because it was about beating Hillary Clinton, Workman explained.
Right now in the middle of a public health crisis and an economic crisis, not knowing whether you're going to have that important health coverage when you go to pick up your prescription is really terrifying, she said. This isn't what the intent of the Affordable Care Act was.
The Republican argument against Obamacare - with which Mister Ip closes his article - is not wrong. I am sorry to report that Obamacare, in its current incarnation, does function as a tax on the middle class to subsidize healthcare for the lower class. But when the white male CEOs of all of the major health insurance companies earn $10 million to $15 million dollars per year and their companies are leaving the healthcare exchanges because they are supposedly losing money, is it really the lower class citizens who are bilking the system?
Denver Health Medical Center, for example, opened a new $26.9 million clinic in the city's southwest in 2016 to provide care to an area lacking in health services and saw more patients within six months than it had expected over two years. The health system planned to build or remodel five more facilities based on the new clinic's success.

The ads will start running on June 1 in the presidential battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina. NextGen has purchased advertising space on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Pandora and Steam.
Still, it's a response, which is more than James has offered. It is one more reason to treat his promises on health care, like those from so many other Republicans, with extreme skepticism.
Between the loss of tax credits and the end of Medicaid funding, 21 million people would lose insurance, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Urban Institute.
But Sanders has since taken pains to court black allies, champion policies outside of what are often strictly defined as economic justice issues and incorporate them into his stump speech. He can no longer be fairly depicted as a politician narrowly focused on economic or class issues.
People were led to expect an immediate and overwhelming impact of that legislation, and that as the recovery dragged on with year after year of very slow employment growth, the popularity of the bill just plummeted, said Michael Steel, a Republican operative who worked as a spokesperson for then-House Minority Leader John Boehner at the time.
The organizations will almost certainly respond by downsizing and scaling back services, so that they end up providing less help, reaching fewer people, or both.
But again, Nahvi's testimony is also supposed to be limited to patient experience, and advocates don't believe he'll be able to make a forceful case for single-payer because of limitations with his expertise.
Sanders speeches in South Carolina and Iowa reflected this diversified focus. He called the criminal justice system broken and racist, and mused about how hypocritical Republicans are who preach small government, except when it comes to women's abortion rights.
Not surprisingly, it was Trump himself who took this to a ridiculous level last week when he tweeted: Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.
The Republican Party's assault on the Affordable Care Act continued Monday as the Trump administration found yet another way to undermine the law's insurance rules.
But since November's elections, much of those plans have been deferred, including a $24 million expansion of a second clinic, largely financed through bonds. The health system still plans to move forward with the construction of one clinic and the remodeling of another. But those plans could be bigger.
Trump's address was also peppered with lies, misstatements and distortions about both his record and Biden's positions, many of which were repeated at other points during the convention. Going over every last lie would require a Herculean effort, but two of them were critical, and Trump is likely to repeat them again and again over the final weeks of the race.
A big reason for that is the same one that checked liberal ambitions in 2009: the resistance of more conservative Democrats. Already two of them, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, have said they would oppose eliminating the filibuster. They've also expressed skepticism about ideas high on the progressive agenda, like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article called Pete Buttigieg the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He is still the mayor.
Fixing The Senate ― And Democracy
The spending cut is not the only change that CMS announced Tuesday. Going forward, it will encourage navigators to educate consumers about skimpier alternatives to traditional insurance ― including short-term, limited-duration plans that frequently leave out basic benefits, such as prescription drugs, and are unavailable to people with pre-existing conditions.
In general, the political effect of conventions has been declining for years as partisanship and polarization has risen, and the Democratic convention provided little boost for Biden's campaign. Expect the polls, and the voters they survey, to give Trump the same treatment.
It's hard to find a respected legal expert today who finds merit in this latest lawsuit. The basis for the states' argument is that Congress originally intended for the pre-existing conditions protections to operate alongside the mandate; if the mandate is gone, the lawsuit reasons, then the pre-existing protections should go too.
But the lawsuit has already gotten favorable rulings from three lower court judges. All three were Republican appointees, just like the Supreme Court majority, which now numbers six conservatives, with Amy Coney Barrett recently placed on the bench.
At least that's what the senators say it will do. Here's the thing, though: That's bogus.
Twitter went bonkers over Trump's announcement.
Our healthcare system is broken and articles with photos like the one above subconsciously perpetuate a myth that black people and minorities are the problem and those poor white CEO's earning $10-$15 million dollars per year are really trying their darnedest to make sure that the healthcare system is fair.
Check out what Trump had to say about disaster and making America great on Fox News at the 2:00 mark in the video above.
Those hardships are real. People who can't pay their bills go hungry, lose their homes and can't pay their medical bills. That is why even public health experts want to come up with smart, careful ways to relax pandemic restrictions.
While some GOP convention speakers stirred fear over crime and rioting, others, such as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Trump himself, framed a win for Biden as tantamount to selling the country out to China.
Again this week, we have almost no idea what Bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. Whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot.
Another conservative pundit, Ben Shapiro, was even more direct: If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19, Shapiro said, adding later, If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, that's tragic and it's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80, so that is not the same thing.
Jayapal continued that she had worked closely with McGovern, who is a Medicare for All advocate himself, and said she was grateful for his leadership.
Dakota Workman, 22, from West Virginia, said the White House was not operating, as Trump insisted, like a fine-tuned machine, though he noted that no administration is this early on. But he appreciated the new coal regulations, the ban on lobbying and Trump's Supreme Court pick even more. If the president backpedaled on Obamacare repeal, he said, he'd be upset with Congress and start thinking about ditching Trump. I sucked up my pride and voted for him more because it was about beating Hillary Clinton, Workman explained.
Two key areas of Trump's tax plan are the repeals of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the estate tax. The AMT requires individuals with a high number of deductions to calculate the amount owed in taxes under the normal rate and the alternative and ultimately pay the higher amount. While the AMT was intended to rid huge deductions by wealthy taxpayers, according to the Tax Policy Center, approximately 5 million people are now affected. The elimination of the estate tax would allow inheritances of $5.5 million for individuals and couples with estates over $11 million to transfer tax free.
Political opportunism helps to explain the apparent shift. In 2009, Republicans and conservatives were trying to block legislation from then-President Barack Obama. Now they are trying to promote and defend President Donald Trump, who has been agitating to end social distancing to open businesses and revive the economy.
What they want is a hearing that's not about Medicare for All, one source involved in planning the hearing told HuffPost. They want someone to say, 'Hey, there's all these different ways of doing things, none of them are bad, they're all equally good.'

(Reuters) - Uncertainty surrounding the Republican plan to replace Obamacare is forcing someU.S. hospitals to delay expansion plans, cut costs, or take on added risk to borrow money for capital investment projects, dealing an economic blow to these facilities and the towns they call home.
What I did not see, for example, was Republican governors refusing [federal] Medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people, Obama said. We've never seen in American history a situation in which state governments reject benefits for their people purely on ideological grounds.
Trump had actually started talking about Obamacare in his opening statement ― when he said that premiums were going up with numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 71 percent. Then, after Clinton had given her assessment of the law, he continued with the theme:
One thing that Sanders clearly does not see as an obstacle is his age. Though that issue would likely surface, its importance could be diminished if the 75-year-old Biden enters the race. And by Election Day in 2020, Trump will be 74.
In Nebraska, an ad for Rep. Don Bacon ― who famously declared himself a hell yes on repeal legislation in 2017 ― talks about a sister who died of cancer and proclaims that he is committed to affordable health care and protecting preexisting conditions.
The proposal under discussion now comes from two Republican senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine. Its focus is insurance for people who buy coverage on their own, either through HealthCare.gov, state exchanges like Covered California, or directly from insurers.
Many wondered why Ivanka and Jared were there. While some questioned whether they were even invited, New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers cleared that up, reporting Saturday that McCain's friend Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Ivanka to attend.
Whether she's weighed the ups and downs of the law appropriately, whether her sometimes vague proposals would improve access to health care at a reasonable price ― these are subjective questions, about which reasonable people can disagree. But the facts she cited on Sunday night were correct, and she's outlined her policy plans clearly, if not always with much detail.
Coverage for preexisting conditions is already the law of the land, he said. Now, not only is he lying to you about giving you something you already have, he's actively trying to take it away, Cuomo added.
The decisions Democrats make all across America in the next few days will determine what this party stand for, what we believe and what we will get done, said Biden, who was declared the winner of the South Carolina primary within a minute of the polls closing Saturday night. We have the option of winning big or losing big.
I think that there were mistakes in many corners from the beginning of the process, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) told The Huffington Post on Friday. The responsible thing to do is keep legislating. My reaction is that when something fails, you keep trying.
Ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give Trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said Tyler, the former campaign aide to Cruz.
It's time for the navigator program to evolve, Seema Verma, the CMS administrator, said in a press release that cited the success of commercial brokers in enrolling individuals and stressed the importance of spending federal funds more judiciously.
We can have a president who wants 100% clean energy, student debt forgiveness and an assault weapons ban, or we can have a white supremacist who tells Americans to drink bleach, said Ben Wessel, the group's executive director. This election is about young Americans and our future, and the choice for us is clear: Joe Biden is the best candidate for president.
Unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, Larry Levitt, who runs health policy at KFF, said in a statement. As unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA will move into the Medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.
But Congress and the administration failed to come to a deal after intense lobbying by hospital and physician groups, and the private equity companies that own medical practices that make tons of money from surprise bills.
So far, the campaign is playing out a lot like it did in 2018, with Republicans insisting, again, that they would never take away protections for people with preexisting conditions. Several are running ads featuring family members who fought medical problems, just to prove how serious they are.
It was a far cry from the government-run insurance plan that Harry Truman once championed, but Democratic leaders embraced it as the best they could get ― and so did Obama, who repeated in our interview his belief that something like a government-run, single-payer system would probably work best, but creating one right away would be too difficult.
But a severe economic downturn was inevitable because people scared of the virus aren't going to engage in commercial activity like they did before. The actual choice policymakers face is whether or not to have the government provide for the population during this crisis ― by guaranteeing that people have money, food, housing and health insurance.
Fewer Protections For People With Pre-existing Conditions
We know that there are millions more who are eligible for coverage but haven't gotten it yet, Obama said.
The U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently arrested a number of immigrants in the center's neighborhood, and Lacayo worries about further actions. What if the United States revokes his residency?
Whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. Trump has already ignored U.S. allies on tariffs and the Paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.
For the last two years, Republicans promised to protect preexisting conditions while trying to gut them. For the next two years, they may pretend to abandon health care repeal, but they're doing everything they can to repeal, sabotage and overturn it, said Jesse Ferguson, a top Democratic strategist. If they were serious about stopping health care repeal, they would be doing something to stop Trump's Department of Justice from trying to strike down the entire law.
Republicans have rejected all of those options, arguing that they would entail too much taxation, spending or regulation ― and ultimately do more harm than good. Their preferred strategy is to roll back the law's existing regulations and, in many cases, reduce financial assistance. Monday's action is consistent with that approach.
Tuesday's oral arguments will offer the first hints of how she and the rest of the justices view this case, although an actual ruling will likely wait several months, maybe even until the spring.
But he also expressed empathy for those frightened by a dramatic change in the system, encouraging them to see themselves in the traditions of presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, all of whom sought to expand health care coverage against the wishes of the private health care industry.
Sanders went on to suggest that those who did not reject that money should have to explain why the health care industry sees their candidacy as a good investment.
Near the end of the conversation, I thought back to something Obama said at the March 2010 signing ceremony: We are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities. We are a nation that does what is hard. What is necessary. Had the difficulty passing and implementing Obamacare shaken that faith?
For weeks, Biden has been making the case that his candidacy would be the most strategic for Democrats, particularly that he can help Democrats win down the ballot in competitive House and Senate races. He has also argued that Sanders' democratic socialism is too big a risk for the party.
Joel is a civil servant through and through ― principled, dedicated to his country and nonpartisan, Nicholas Bagley, who served at Justice from 2007 to 2010 and is now at the University of Michigan, told HuffPost. If people like him are jumping ship, it's a troubling sign of institutional rot at the Justice Department.
Below is how Mister Ip's article appeared on the Internet. And let me ask you, What is wrong with this picture?
The Paycheck Protection Program gives employers loans primarily to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic. Collins is part of a bipartisan push advocating an extension of these loans.
No one will be safe in Biden's America, Trump said in the closest thing the 70-minute speech had to a summary.
Then, deploying his trademark sarcasm, Sanders panned the logic of Republicans and some Democrats who defend the current payment system.
The timing seemed fortuitous because it was right before the 10-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act's signing, a milestone he planned to mark by attending a conference and celebration at American University nearby. Then the pandemic hit, forcing it to be canceled, which felt somehow appropriate given that the law continues to inspire mixed feelings. Approval of the program is higher than in the past, according to polls, but it's still lower than cherished programs like Medicare and Social Security.
During the debate, Clinton made the same argument she's made so many times before ― that the pluses of Obamacare far outweigh the minuses, so the best next step is to fix the law's shortcomings. And although she ran out of time to describe these steps in detail, she has said previously she would focus on reducing the cost of prescription drugs and providing more financial assistance to people with particularly onerous premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
NextGen America, which is funded by former presidential candidate and billionaire investor Tom Steyer, will officially endorse Biden on Wednesday and has reserved the digital ad buy to reach voters younger than 35. The group's decision to back Biden isn't surprising; it had already announced plans to spend more than $40 million targeting Trump and key Republican-held Senate seats this year.
Other Republicans who are facing a competitive reelection fight are similarly choosing their words carefully when discussing Obamacare.
The orders don't do anything about anything, though. It's just more vaporware from the Trump administration. Slogans, lies and exaggerations aren't policies. Trump pitched his phantom plan by saying it rests on three pillars: more choice, lower costs, and better care, and that it would put patients first.
How Trump Could Weaken The Mandate
If the Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, then join us, the former vice president said to roaring applause.
And that, according to Biden, comes down to a race between him and Sanders.
Obama's announcement was based on a report the Department of Health and Human Services published the same day, which found 17.7 million working-age adults became insured between the beginning of Obamacare's first enrollment period in 2013 and the close of this year's sign-up campaign last month. The department estimates 2.3 million adults under the age of 26 got covered through the law's provision allowing young adults to remain on their parents' policies.
Meanwhile, at the Spanish Catholic Center, which is run by Catholic Charities, Aguirre said, they're seeing kids go hungry.
But even if Hatch and Grassley were truly interested in bipartisanship, they did not speak for their party or for leadership, which from the beginning urged members to oppose Obama's agenda fully ― as Mitch McConnell, who was (and is again) the Senate minority leader, later admitted. All of this happened at a time when the GOP was also becoming more ideologically extreme, with conservatives displacing the remaining moderates.

Now another national debate is taking place. It's about how to open up businesses in the country amid a coronavirus pandemic that has already killed more than 102,000 people, many of them elderly and unwell, and is sure to kill many more.
More recently, some COVID-19 relief measures have extended or built upon part of the Affordable Care Act ― which is yet more proof, as University of Connecticut professor John Cogan has argued, that Congress understood the law would stay in place and supports that.
Republicans' ideas are unpopular. Their president is historically unpopular. Their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and their deliberate mismanagement and weakening of the law's benefits are unpopular. They are under sustained assault from Democrats highlighting (and mostly accurately describing) the GOP health policy agenda, especially on the question of people with pre-existing conditions. And most Americans are inclined to side with Democrats on this issue.
Asked to clarify her position on Obamacare last week, McSally told HuffPost she believed the way Obamacare did it was not the way to do it. However, she quickly acknowledged the changed politics surrounding the law and its impact on the country's health care system, arguing it ought to be fixed rather than repealed outright.
The problems for the Brooklyn-born Vermonter didn't end with the 2016 election. His April 2017 decision to campaign for Democrat Heath Mello, an abortion-rights opponent who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, raised eyebrows on the left.
Sanders, who sermonizes about U.S. politics in stark moral terms, remains most comfortable expounding on economic policy. It is a tendency that has elicited criticism from some liberals eager to hear him address systemic racial justice and entrenched sexism in more explicit terms.
The 2009 stimulus law started popular: A CNN poll conducted shortly before its passage found 54% of Americans supported the law, with 45% in opposition. But unemployment remained high ― it was 9.8% when voters went to the polls in November 2010 ― and Republicans ridiculed it as a waste of money, pointing to infrastructure projects that created few jobs and ridiculous-sounding scientific research it funded.
Obamacare's Problems And Two Visions For Fixing Them
Although McElvain has not publicly offered a reason for his resignation, the Post article said that his departure highlights internal frustration with the Trump administration's decision to support a lawsuit from officials in 20 conservative states. That lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in Texas, could wipe out key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
The problem for advocates of Medicare for All isn't simply the Republicans in the Senate, who have called it socialism and pledged to fight it tooth and nail. A number of more conservative and centrist-minded Democratic senators remain uncomfortable with the idea, preferring instead more immediate measures that would bolster the insurance market under Obamacare.
This time, the agency that runs the health insurance exchanges is slashing funds for organizations that help people to shop for coverage, forcing the groups to make do with about one-fourth of the federal funding they got for this year's open enrollment.
I think that there were mistakes in many corners from the beginning of the process, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) told The Huffington Post on Friday. The responsible thing to do is keep legislating. My reaction is that when something fails, you keep trying.

During Aetna's April 29, 2016, Q1 2016 earnings call, Aetna said that it had a very good cost structure in states in which it had experienced growth in its ACA exchange population, including Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. Why is Aetna withdrawing from states in which it had a very good cost structure or where Aetna has performed well in the past?
To process what the candidates were saying, it helps to get an accurate picture of what's actually happening with Obamacare these days.
He concluded his remarks on an optimistic note, citing Americans' long history of overcoming prejudice and hatred.
The kids are born U.S. citizens, he says. They have a right to get food. We're going to have a huge population that will struggle. We might not see it now, but we will in 20 years, when these kids come into the workforce.
The deal was achieved by Obama. The Republican primary voting base hated Obama. Anything Obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.
One of those structural problems, he said, is that the conservative media universe operates in an entirely different universe, less tethered to reality. Another, he said, is the makeup U.S. Senate, where the small-state bias gives lawmakers representing a small portion of the population the ability to block legislation ― and to escape accountability for doing so.

These plans typically cover a lot less than the sorts of plans available through the Affordable Care Act. They may have weak coverage of prescriptions, if they have any at all, and leave out mental health altogether. Usually they do not cover pre-existing conditions and are often not available to people who have them.
If the Supreme Court strikes down the law, those protections disappear. But such a ruling would do much more.
When DeVos declined to commit to proceeding with the gainful employment rule at her confirmation hearing in January, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), said, Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like that.
Declining government spending would reduce the federal deficit, the CBO predicted in that report, and average premiums for people buying coverage on their own would end up lower than they would have been otherwise. But those lower premiums would be a byproduct of older and sicker people dropping insurance altogether ― because insurers would have made it too pricey for them, and because the plans available on the market would have tended to cover much less.
Ip writes, So how can the ACA be fixed? Democrats' solution is, essentially, more subsidies. Mr. Obama has called for a public option, a federal health plan to supplement private insurers. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, goes even further: She wants anyone over 55 to be able to opt into Medicare. Both would nudge the U.S. closer to a 'single payer' model like Canada's that liberal activists have long sought. Yet this would require a lot more money and further erode market forces in health care. (FYI, just as family values is Republican code for anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage, Canada is Republican code for socialism.)
And it was telling that neither the state's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. James Smith, nor any of the party's House contenders shared the stage with Sanders.
In subsequent remarks, both Trump and Ryan indicated they were ready to move on from health care to other issues.
Republicans have rejected all of those options, arguing that they would entail too much taxation, spending or regulation ― and ultimately do more harm than good. Their preferred strategy is to roll back the law's existing regulations and, in many cases, reduce financial assistance. Monday's action is consistent with that approach.
Donald Trump has lost the presidential election, but his last, desperate effort to kill the Affordable Care Act will get its day before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, when the justices hear arguments in a Republican-backed lawsuit alleging that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
During the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency, Trump had promised not just to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but to replace it with great health care and insurance for everybody. But when the Congressional Budget Office analyzed an early version of the GOP proposal, it predicted the number of people without insurance would increase by 24 million over the next decade, going up by 14 million in 2018 alone.
Or maybe those Canadians aren't so dumb after all and have figured out how to provide better healthcare opportunities to a wider range of people and not just the anointed elite?
Mary actually took her own necklace off and tossed it onto her bed! Insouciantly. It clattered.
The bill would have made some other major changes, as well ― such as ending the individual mandate, the unpopular financial penalty for people who do not get health insurance, and rolling back new taxes on the wealthy and health care companies that the government uses to finance the law's coverage expansion.
This new guidance allows states to set up parallel insurance markets that may be able to attract healthy people with plans that have lower premiums but fewer consumer protections, leaving ACA plans with a sicker pool and higher premiums, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost on Monday.
COLUMBIA, S.C. ― South Carolina was the site of one of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' most humiliating defeats in his 2016 presidential run. He received just 26 percent of the vote in the Palmetto State's early primary, presaging a shutout in the South that virtually assured Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination.
What they want is a hearing that's not about Medicare for All, one source involved in planning the hearing told HuffPost. They want someone to say, 'Hey, there's all these different ways of doing things, none of them are bad, they're all equally good.'
Complicating matters further, Republicans have been trying to pass repeal legislation through budget reconciliation ― an expedited process that would allow Republicans to get a bill through the Senate without the threat of a Democratic filibuster, so that a simple majority vote would be sufficient.
The claim was so outrageous that Politifact named it the lie of the year.
Congressional GOP leaders are playing the same game. In an interview with Bloomberg TV this month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) used one side of his mouth to say, There's nobody in the Senate that I'm familiar with who is not in favor of coverage of pre-existing conditions, and the other side to say, I don't fault the administration for trying to give us an opportunity to do this differently and to go in a different direction.
But this latest regulatory change is a reminder that the GOP has never given up on its goal of wiping Obamacare off the books, and that people with serious medical problems are likely to suffer as a result.
It's a great turnout. And it's kind of funny, I was told that there were no progressives in South Carolina, he deadpanned to an approving crowd.
Democratic candidates running for president are in the middle of a heated debate about health care, one that will only intensify under the glare of television cameras as they take the stage in Detroit, Michigan, for the second presidential debate this week.
Having last week joined Trump and Tom Price in offering the old GOP deception that a bill cutting health care benefits is not actually a cut; and saying that people cut off from Obamacare could simply get jobs to fix the problem, even though many jobs don't come with health benefits, Kellyanne Conway offered up a new swipe at Americans who may lose some health coverage if the latest GOP health care bill is enacted. Addressing the impact on opioid addicts of GOP cuts to Medicaid, after Trump early this year pledged to expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted, Conway said such patients can overcome such funding shortfalls with a four-letter word called 'will.' Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), whose state saw nearly 2,000 opioid overdose deaths last year, responded that Conway owes an apology to the entire addiction and treatment community for her outrageous and disrespectful remarks.
The message NextGen is deploying, however, is surprisingly simple. The best way to get young voters eager to pull the lever for a 77-year-old they overwhelmingly rejected in favor of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the presidential primaries is to point out his agreement with them on a host of issues. The ads don't make grandiose arguments about how Biden will unite the country but instead argue he's the best bet for progress on issues younger adults care about.
Polling shows Biden leading Trump by significant margins among young people, both nationally and in key swing states. But top Democratic operatives have long worried about young people's relative lack of enthusiasm to actually cast a ballot in 2020 and fear it could prove politically deadly in a close race.
Medicare recipients would also feel the effects. The Affordable Care Act bolstered it in several ways, most obviously by gradually eliminating a gap in prescription drug coverage that became known as the doughnut hole. Without the Affordable Care Act in place, that gap could open back up, leaving seniors to pay more money for their drugs.
And what is the Republican solution? Cutting Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, of course!
Tom Williams via Getty Images There's wariness that the hearing on Medicare for All could end up supporting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's position that the best way forward is to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act.
Why GOP Leaders Couldn't Get The Votes
This is pretty terrible, Jodi Ray, who is the project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families, told HuffPost. We will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources.
If he told the same lies that Hillary Clinton was caught in ― using a private email server for public business ― I couldn't vote for him then, said Andrew Pace, 19, of Florida, who wore a Make America Great Again hat signed by conservative media provocateur James O'Keefe as he walked the hotel halls. But even then, I'd vote for another Republican candidate. Either that or [Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). I love Tulsi.
But for Republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the Iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.
The GOP's hope is that by focusing on Medicare for All, they can instead portray Democrats ― even those who don't support the proposal ― as the extremists hoping to blow up the health care system.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA, encouraged Americans to sign up for Obamacare if they lose their health insurance.
I think it's been an interesting idea to generate conversation about how we best provide health care to people, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said on Tuesday when asked if she could support a version of Medicare for All. I'm interested in doing everything we can as quickly as possible to give as many people access to health care as we can, and I don't think that will do it ... I think there are other ways to cover people faster.
But consumers who use navigators frequently end up enrolling in Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program or other special programs ― or simply enrolling on their own, at home, after long consultation with navigators. As a result, they don't show up as enrolling in the private marketplace plans, which is the metric CMS is using to judge navigator performance.
But James has also run into a familiar political problem for Republicans. Back in 2017, he called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, describing the law as a monstrosity. Now he is under attack for trying to take away the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions.
But Biden now supports tougher enforcement and public investments as part of a Buy American program that he says would generate 5 million new manufacturing jobs. And the United States' trade deficit with China ― accompanied by the flight of manufacturing jobs ― has continued to climb during Trump's presidency.
NextGen's research into young voter opinions about Biden found many knew little about the former vice president, especially those whose political awakening post-dated former President Barack Obama's successful 2008 campaign. Some were unaware of Biden's stances on issues such as gun control, immigration and health care, and saw him as little more than another career politician.
But Monday's rule change almost certainly means that, overall, people with serious medical problems are likely to have a harder time finding coverage ― and, ultimately, paying their medical bills.
Why Trump would expect to get Democratic votes when he was gunning to gut their primary domestic policy achievement and refusing to talk to them about doing so is not clear. But he clearly felt that it was in their self-interest to have worked with him even though he never asked. Speaking to reporters, the president said he expected Democrats to now be supportive of reform because they'd have no one else to blame when or if Obamacare collapsed.
Election Day is 40 days away, and Trump knows he's on the wrong side of public opinion on health care. He's going to keep repeating falsehoods and misrepresentations about his health care record and agenda. But the totality of his actions as president makes very clear that his promises of better, cheaper health care are extremely hard to believe.
Obama traveled to Milwaukee because the city bested other locations in a challenge to sign up the most people in the enrollment period that recently ended. Close to 13 million enrolled in private coverage via the Obamacare health insurance exchanges this year.
Health care has been a politically damaging issue for Republicans, who before the pandemic repeatedly attempted to repeal Obamacare, end Medicaid expansion and significantly cut Medicaid funding. The Trump administration has continued to support a GOP lawsuit to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and pushed an effort to add work requirements for Medicaid. Since the pandemic, the Trump administration promised to use some of the coronavirus stimulus funds to reimburse hospitals treating uninsured patients with COVID-19, but there has been no plan to address the growing millions of uninsured Americans more generally.
When I read his letter, it made a powerful impact on me, Obama said. Brent is why we fought so hard to fix a broken health care system in the first place.
Circumstances could always change. But for now, it looks like those reservations have left the proposal without the support it needs to get through Congress ― as part of this new spending bill and, perhaps, as part of any other legislation this year.
Hence, Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings, counting down the week's ten most disgraceful figures in the Trump administration. Will yourself off opioids (see 7 below) and grab a ringside seat.
Complicating matters further, Republicans have been trying to pass repeal legislation through budget reconciliation ― an expedited process that would allow Republicans to get a bill through the Senate without the threat of a Democratic filibuster, so that a simple majority vote would be sufficient.
They may have failed to repeal the law, but they have endeavored to make it harder for people to get coverage. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report demonstrating the effects of the sabotage ― and the higher premiums it has created ― just last week: lower enrollment, especially among those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies.
These steps include dramatic cuts in funding for enrollment outreach and promotion, as well as a change in federal regulations that will allow people to hold on to limited-benefit, short-term plans for nearly three years. That change, along with repeal of the individual mandate's financial penalty for people who don't have comprehensive coverage, makes these short-term plans a more viable alternative for people.
CNN's Chris Cuomo slammed Trump's vow as a dangerous lie.
The law's protections for people with preexisting conditions would no longer be in effect, less-visible reforms covering everything from billing fraud to food calorie postings would vanish, and the entire health care system could plunge into chaos.
And although it's impossible to know what role health care played in that race, analysts agree it was a big reason why Republicans nationally suffered such big losses, enough to cost them control of the House of Representatives.

Other Democrats noted the stimulus was passed before the rise of super PACs and other well-funded outside groups with the capacity to spend millions promoting a law. Both House and Senate Democrats have affiliated nonprofits that can promote the Rescue Act in key states and districts, and Build Back Together ― a nonprofit aiming to boost Biden's agenda ― is expected to come online soon.
The capital gains tax would be reduced from 23.8 to 20 percent. This reduction comes from the elimination of the 3.8 percent tax that helps fund Obamacare applying to investment income over $250,000 for a married couple. This cut is to incentivize investors for increasing investments while minimizing the after-tax liability. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hopes to greatly encourage investments and, in the long and short-term, stimulate economic growth.
Obviously, Obama said, that did not prove to be the case.
In South Carolina, Black voters don't need to be pressed hard to say what draws them to Biden. It's Obama.
More than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, meaning millions will be left without health insurance. In mid May, left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute estimated 16.2 million people have lost health insurance once provided by their employer — how roughly half of Americans get their health insurance. That number could be as high as 26.8 million if those who lost their jobs don't sign up for other coverage, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.
I imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way. Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party
Negotiations to include the proposal as part of the big spending bill moving through Congress have broken down, as Peter Sullivan of The Hill first reported Monday. The primary reason is a dispute over federal funding of abortions: Republican leaders are insisting the proposal include restrictions that most Democrats will not support.
The failure to pass the bill represents a devastating defeat for Trump and Ryan ― and throws into doubt a crusade that has defined Republican politics for over seven years.
And then there would be effects that have nothing to do with health insurance. The law is the reason that restaurant chains must post calorie counts on their menus, for example. It modified the Indian Health Service and changed the approval process for so-called biosimilar drugs.
That's why insurers are jacking up prices this year and why big commercial insurers are pulling out of some markets altogether. In some parts of the country, consumers have only one insurance option. Meanwhile, even many of the insured still face high out-of-pocket costs ― and are finding the only affordable plans have narrow networks of providers.
GOP voters remain loyal to the president. And not by small margins. While just 39 percent of all respondents in a recent Pew poll said they approved of the job Trump was doing, 84 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they felt that way. GOP support for Trump surpasses that for George W. Bush, his father, and Ronald Reagan at similar points in their presidencies.
During Aetna's April 29, 2016, Q1 2016 earnings call, Aetna said that it had a very good cost structure in states in which it had experienced growth in its ACA exchange population, including Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. Why is Aetna withdrawing from states in which it had a very good cost structure or where Aetna has performed well in the past?
In the end, exit polls found 89% of 2010 midterm voters said the economy was in bad shape, and 41% said their family's financial situation was worse than it had been two years ago, compared to just 14% who said their financial situation had improved. Republicans gained six seats in the Senate and took control of the House, picking up a whopping 63 seats.
That means the mandate is an unconstitutional command, according to the lawsuit. And because the law's component parts are so interconnected, the lawsuit says, the whole thing has to come off the books.
President Donald Trump has continuously touted his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He has yet to put forth any legitimate legislation to take its place, despite his repeated attacks to repeal Obamacare.
Among the provision's chief proponents was Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who thought the incendiary portrayals of it were nuts.
I don't even know what I'd tell a health system if they came to me asking what to do, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan.
And although it's impossible to know what role health care played in that race, analysts agree it was a big reason why Republicans nationally suffered such big losses, enough to cost them control of the House of Representatives.
What if Trump cuts off Medicare? What if he cuts off food stamps?
Congressional Quarterly via Getty Images Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen spoke outside the Supreme Court Tuesday.
In general, it was an attempt to shift the race from a referendum on Trump's performance ― a referendum Trump is very likely to fail ― toward a choice between himself and Biden. Trump mentioned Biden's name more than 40 times in his speech Thursday night. Biden never directly mentioned Trump during his speech the week before.
The end of Christie's term in office can't come quick enough for the people of New Jersey, who currently give the governor a 15 percent approval rating. Christie could quickly replace hapless Reince Priebus (June 15 ranking: 10) as White House chief of staff, assuming Priebus is tired of the humiliation at Trump's hands, and Christie is tanned, rested, and ready for more humiliation at Trump's hands.
Still, anxiety remains, even in sanctuary cities. Earlier this year, Reuters reported the Trump administration was considering making it harder for immigrants to get a green card if they or their U.S.-born children used public assistance programs such as food stamps. Advocates say that sent many immigrants into a panic.
Shortly after Cotton's speech on Thursday, the Biden campaign sent out an email blast to reporters with the subject line: Donald Trump Is the Weakest President in U.S. History When It Comes to China – and Chinese Officials Are Pulling for His Re-election. The attack memo highlights, among other things, Trump's initial reluctance to criticize China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak, his calls for the Chinese government to investigate the Bidens to benefit him politically and Trump's inaccurate claim that he banned travel to the U.S. from China in order to contain COVID-19.
Washington Republicans, meanwhile, predict a replay. They argue the legislation's popularity will drop as voters are exposed to less popular aspects of the law, and suggest it won't serve as the economic rocket ship Democrats are expecting.
These short-term plans can be very cheap because they don't end up paying much in the way of medical bills. They reliably draw in healthy people, leaving them exposed to large medical bills if they get sick even, as they force insurers to jack up prices for more comprehensive coverage.
When the Committee analyzed Trump's plans, by contrast, it determined that they would add $5.3 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years.
President Donald Trump's Justice Department decided not to defend the law in court, which is not the normal way the department handles cases challenging federal laws. The administration, however, doesn't want to throw out the whole law ― just the parts that protect people with pre-existing conditions. Some Democratic state officials have stepped to take the federal government's place and fight the lawsuit.
What we have found is not that people are so crazy about Joe Biden. It's that they really love President Obama. Shaun King, a civil rights activist and surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
There's no need to speculate about how insurance companies would respond to this, because this is how the system worked for people who bought individual policies before the Affordable Care Act. Insurers don't make money paying claims; they make money by avoiding claims or refusing the pay them. If they're allowed to keep the most expensive people and treatments off their books, they will.
Now another national debate is taking place. It's about how to open up businesses in the country amid a coronavirus pandemic that has already killed more than 102,000 people, many of them elderly and unwell, and is sure to kill many more.

And the consequences of a decision going in the other direction, wiping out the Affordable Care Act, would be enormous.
Miller also described the potential for a downward financial and health spiral for some Americans, calling it a double hit.
More moderate members, many of them from Democratic-leaning states and states that used Affordable Care Act money to expand Medicaid, worried that the bill would take away insurance coverage from too many people ― and that, if premiums really did come down, they would do so only by increasing out-of-pocket costs for people who held on to their coverage.
Rumors fuel the fear, said Maricela Delcid, a navigator at the nonprofit who helps eligible immigrants enroll in social services. Most of the immigrant parents she works with are undocumented, and therefore don't qualify for benefits such as food stamps. But they don't understand that they can apply on behalf of their U.S.-born children, Delcid said.
She raised her hand when asked whether she would abolish private insurance during the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in late June, but subsequently disavowed the remark, claiming she had misheard the question.
There were two baskets prepared by Mrs. Patmore. Two! And they were big.
The 2009 stimulus law started popular: A CNN poll conducted shortly before its passage found 54% of Americans supported the law, with 45% in opposition. But unemployment remained high ― it was 9.8% when voters went to the polls in November 2010 ― and Republicans ridiculed it as a waste of money, pointing to infrastructure projects that created few jobs and ridiculous-sounding scientific research it funded.
It was a far cry from the government-run insurance plan that Harry Truman once championed, but Democratic leaders embraced it as the best they could get ― and so did Obama, who repeated in our interview his belief that something like a government-run, single-payer system would probably work best, but creating one right away would be too difficult.
The conversation with Obama, inside an office building not far from the White House, lasted for nearly an hour. He looked more relaxed than I'd ever seen him. He was wearing a black, open-collar shirt, casual dark gray pants and loafers ― and, as he gleefully pointed out, no socks. The best part of not being president anymore, he said of his attire. But he talked like he always did, with that deliberate, professorial cadence and sentences full of dependent clauses in order to capture every last nuance.
McSally is denying her change in tone marks a significant shift ― she said it was fake news when an interviewer asked her about it on Friday. But her new rhetoric, which comes after years of support for a full repeal of Obamacare and after a vote for a plan that would have increased costs and weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions, is representative of how Republican senators up for reelection in 2020 are approaching the law.
What editor thought it would be a good idea to include a photo of a white doctor helping a sullen black patient (obviously a beneficiary of Obamacare and probably some other wasteful Democrat subsidies or entitlement programs) in this article???
When I read his letter, it made a powerful impact on me, Obama said. Brent is why we fought so hard to fix a broken health care system in the first place.
The year was 2009, and things did not end well for the Democratic Party. The stimulus legislation grew steadily less popular over time as job growth sputtered. The midterm election a year later would wipe out their massive House majority, and usher in a wave of austerity that further hampered the country's economic comeback.
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. Only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn't that simple. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated, he said in February 2017.
WASHINGTON ― In 2017, now-Arizona Sen. Martha McSally really, really wanted to repeal Obamacare. McSally, then a congresswoman, reportedly stood up in the middle of a GOP conference meeting and urged her colleagues to vote for a bill to gut the signature Democratic domestic policy achievement of the past decade, telling them to get this fucking thing done.
Thanks to President Biden and Democrats, help is on the way, a narrator declares in the ad.
The majority of consumers get tax credits that discount premiums, sometimes so deeply that coverage is basically free, and that's one reason that the number of people without insurance has fallen to historic lows while access to care appears to have improved. But plenty of middle- and upper-income people are stuck paying more ― and in some cases coverage is now flat-out unaffordable.

But plenty of middle- and upper-income people are stuck paying more ― and in some cases coverage is now flat-out unaffordable.
When asked in an April interview with HuffPost whether he had grown more sensitive to the need to speak to the particular challenges facing black Americans ― who comprise just a sliver of Vermont's population ― Sanders admitted that he had.
The law has allowed something like 20 million people to get insurance, bringing the number of uninsured to a record low. Predictions that the law would cause national health care costs to skyrocket have proved spectacularly wrong, as have predictions that the law would cause the deficit to explode or kill the job market.
There is a good healthy skepticism with most people, said CPAC's organizer, Matt Schlapp. Conservatives have felt like they've taken the bait before. ... Voters get told, 'Oh yeah. We will do this.' And then they get into power and sometimes don't do so much because those issues are controversial. The one thing about Donald Trump is what he's showing conservatives, is that he doesn't seem to care that much if something is controversial. If it is something he said he was going to do, he is a bulldog about getting it done.
That effort did not succeed, but as part of their 2017 tax cut, Republicans managed to zero out the law's individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance by hitting them with a financial penalty if they don't. The Trump administration has also taken a series of executive actions, such as slashing the Affordable Care Act's advertising budget, that have depressed enrollment or otherwise undermined it.
The answers from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump provided a near-perfect distillation of very different ways they think about the world ― and how, most likely, they would govern as president.
Medicare recipients would also feel the effects. The Affordable Care Act bolstered it in several ways, most obviously by gradually eliminating a gap in prescription drug coverage that became known as the doughnut hole. Without the Affordable Care Act in place, that gap could open back up, leaving seniors to pay more money for their drugs.
This time, Democrats insist, will be different. The $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, dubbed the American Rescue Plan, provides far more direct relief to Americans than the 2009 legislation. The White House, full of veterans of President Barack Obama's administration, and Democratic outside groups are preparing to wage an extended political battle to make sure voters appreciate the aid they're receiving.
Talking about his starter home, Obama told me, It's been vandalized. And people at times tried to undermine its foundations. But it's held up. He's right, and now the Biden administration may even have a chance to do some of the repair work Obama never could, starting with extra funding for subsidies that is already in the Democratic COVID-19 relief bill.
Still, after HuffPost asked those questions about a potential lack of Medicare for All voices on the panel, the Rules Committee tweeted the video of Nahvi making the case for single-payer health care.
A New York Times/Siena poll out Monday showed him trailing Peters by just 1 percentage point, 42% to 43%. It's only the latest poll to suggest the race is close, even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has maintained a relatively comfortable lead in Michigan.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents facing reelection, introduced one such measure this year, allowing him to say he stands with Trump on Obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
While the Rules Committee and Pelosi's staff contest leadership's role in choosing witnesses, sources close to the process insist Primus was intimately involved.
The Affordable Care Act is responsible for historic progress, bringing the number of uninsured Americans to a record low, thereby improving access to care and bolstering financial security. But millions of people are unhappy with their coverage, and in some states, newly regulated insurance markets have struggled ― with premiums rising even higher and insurers, stung by financial losses, pulling up stakes.
This is what the Obama administration argued in 2011 when it declined to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The decision was controversial, with even some of the administration's own lawyers cautioning that it set a bad precedent.
They may have failed to repeal the law, but they have endeavored to make it harder for people to get coverage. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report demonstrating the effects of the sabotage ― and the higher premiums it has created ― just last week: lower enrollment, especially among those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies.
Not every 2020 Democrat is in the same place on abortion. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands out for, for years, supporting the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits spending federal money (such as Medicaid) on abortion services. And after the Alabama law passed, he notably tweeted a statement that was noticeably less fiery and outraged than what the other candidates were putting out. But he too seems to be feeling the energy: In early May, he said he no longer supports Hyde.
Today, Americans who buy insurance on their own can get tax credits if their income is below four times the poverty line (about $100,000 a year for a family of four). Those credits effectively discount premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year. They would be gone if the Affordable Care Act comes off the books, leaving millions to buy coverage on their own without that assistance.
Meanwhile, at the Spanish Catholic Center, which is run by Catholic Charities, Aguirre said, they're seeing kids go hungry.
COLUMBIA, S.C. — On the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Joe Biden went to church in Barack Obama country.
Meanwhile, Democrats have begun to wonder, with good reason, whether the specific reforms under discussion could hurt more insurance buyers than they would help.
He then challenged his fellow contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination to pledge the same, dedicating a new webpage on his campaign site to the appeal.
This kind of mobilization can actually make the GOP think twice about how hard they want to push because they know that they're losing women in droves right now, and they know that their political fate for decades to come is on the line, she told HuffPost.
At this point, with Biden holding a stable lead and fewer than 70 days until Election Day, Biden wins by not losing.
The Obama administration expended tremendous effort shaping and nurturing the new system during its infancy and addressing problems as they came up. Now the Trump administration is in charge of managing these marketplaces, and its intentions are not clear.
Republican officials from 20 states are asking a federal judge in Texas to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, which would include its provisions guaranteeing access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.
This is actually an argument that Alexander and Collins have sometimes made to their colleagues ― that it's in the GOP's self-interest to find bipartisan agreement on policies to reduce health insurance premiums. It looks like that argument is not carrying the day.
The story with James in Michigan is pretty much the same.

I'm going home to do my research, she said after Biden spoke.
NextGen's research into young voter opinions about Biden found many knew little about the former vice president, especially those whose political awakening post-dated former President Barack Obama's successful 2008 campaign. Some were unaware of Biden's stances on issues such as gun control, immigration and health care, and saw him as little more than another career politician.
The quote was relayed to HuffPost numerous times in the course of reporting this story and has clearly made its way to the single-payer groups. Pelosi's spokesman declined to comment on the Primus quote.
In fact, although Verma said a major goal of Monday's guidance was to give states more flexibility, the guidance states explicitly that state waiver applications should foster health coverage through competitive private coverage... over public programs.
Sanders' September 2017 single-payer health care legislation received the support of about one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus; even former President Barack Obama has praised the underlying policy. And as Sanders is fond of noting on the stump, 70 percent of Americans say they support Medicare for all, according to a Reuters poll in August.

The story with James in Michigan is pretty much the same.
Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, shot back on Wednesday, suggesting it was unrealistic. Without unicorns, magic wands ... health care is not free, he said on MSNBC.
Sanders delivered the speech at a tenuous moment in his second presidential bid. His standing has dropped in many national- and state-level polls, putting Warren and Harris within striking distance of his second-place standing, as all three scramble to overcome the substantial lead Biden continues to enjoy.
Despite the invite, the Twitterverse was quick to note the irony of Ivanka and Jared's presence, especially in the face of speakers' not-so-subtle digs at the president.
But the conversation covered a lot more than health care policy, because it's impossible to talk about the 2010 law without talking about the ways politics have been changing in the past decade, and how those changes affected what Democrats were and weren't able to do. In many ways, the saga of the Affordable Care Act is a case study in the challenges that progressives must overcome if they want to pass ambitious legislation ― challenges facing Democrats now just as surely as they did during Obama's tenure.

Now there's a new debate, about the effect of COVID-19 on public health and the economy ― and how to respond.
Another ad similarly paints Biden's election as simply a part of the solution rather than a revolutionary act. Our generation deserves better, and Joe Biden can help us get there, the ad's narrator says. We know the fight for progress won't stop after Election Day, but there are enough of us to start making progress again.
By design, the mandate is sizable: It's either $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of a household's income ― whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family.
This will be shocking news to Biden, who won the Democratic primary by opposing the kinds of health care reforms, like Medicare for All, that his progressive opponents favored and that also wouldn't do what Trump says they would. Instead, Biden is running on a potentially consequential but also kind of boring plan to make Obamacare coverage cheaper.
That last requirement, implemented by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's top health care staffer, Wendell Primus, according to sources, is particularly an issue for some single-payer advocates, because they believe the hearing could turn into an exercise in which witnesses seem to endorse all sorts of different approaches to health care ― the ACA, a Medicare buy-in situation, and perhaps, maybe, Medicare for All.
There were no criteria and no limits on who could testify, Connelly said.
This guidance suggests the federal government will allow states to target assistance differently, as Verma confirmed Monday, which could mean giving people more assistance if they buy short-term or other alternative plans ― and less assistance if they stick with comprehensive coverage.
There's no way to know whether they accurately reflect what administration officials believe or how they intend to act. And it's anybody's guess as to whether Trump has personally settled on a course of action ― or if he even cares enough about policy details to decide on one.
In a call to arms designed to further affirm his populist credentials and distinguish himself in a crowded primary field, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) committed on Wednesday to reject contributions of $200 or more from executives at the country's pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, as well as the political action committees and lobbyists who represent them.
But if you remember the promise, you may also remember how empty it was.
Moreover, the progress in growing the exchanges and in covering the uninsured may be stalling. Total enrollment on the exchanges barely grew compared to last year, and those who remain uninsured are considered the most difficult to locate and persuade. That's especially true for households that earn too much to qualify for health insurance subsidies.
If the administration takes such action, it's likely that fewer people would pay a financial penalty for not having health insurance, but people who hold onto their coverage would face higher premiums. In addition, the number of people without coverage would rise, maybe even dramatically.
Government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost, she posted on her Facebook page. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.
When you get no votes from the other side ― meaning the Democrats ― it is a very difficult situation, he said elsewhere.

Joe Biden aided and abetted China's rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers, Cotton said.
The case, known as California v. Texas, is the third such challenge to reach the high court since the law's 2010 enactment. And the stakes are as high as ever. If the justices wipe out the Affordable Care Act, as 18 Republican state officials and the Trump administration have asked it to do, roughly 21 million Americans could lose health insurance, according to independent projections.
The proposal from Alexander and Collins seeks to mitigate those kinds of increases, primarily through two new spending initiatives. One would allocate $30.5 billion over three years for reinsurance and invisible high-risk pools, each of which would reimburse insurers for the beneficiaries with the biggest medical bills ― thereby allowing insurers to reduce premiums.
WASHINGTON ― One month into his presidency, Donald Trump's popularity has begun tanking with every constituency, save one.
Is it a farce? It probably is, but no one wants to say that, this person said, on the condition of anonymity.
I saw the same thing about 15 years ago, and then all of a sudden he walked into the office, McCallum said in his sermon. This young man by the name of Barack Obama said, 'Yes we can.' I'm here to say we will.
Just about the only thing clear right now are the policy stakes. And they are significant.
It was an energetic speech from Biden, who has been dinged on the campaign trail for an apparent inability to spur the same enthusiasm and movement-style politics as Sanders. The senator won the popular vote in Iowa, the New Hampshire primary and had a blowout victory in the Nevada caucuses.
Digital First Media/Longmont Times-Call/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) greets supporters in Boulder, Colorado, on Wednesday. As he campaigns on behalf of the Democratic cause in this year's midterms, he's also gearing up for another White House run.
Progressives have balked at the idea, calling it a giveaway to private insurance companies and big corporations that run their own health insurance plans. Subsidizing COBRA would direct federal funds toward private companies that pay higher rates than public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Other health care proposals that have been championed by progressives in both the House and Senate would have Medicare cover Americans' out-of-pocket medical costs during the pandemic, or allow Americans who have filed for unemployment to be eligible for Medicare.
The fact that they haven't been able to come up with something, Obama said, indicates either bad faith on their part or the fact that we were pretty thorough and looking at all the options and we arrived at what was the most realistic way to deliver universal health coverage.
There is also the proposal to eliminate itemized tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable giving. Mnuchin stated that the reasoning behind this move was to eliminate tax loopholes while offsetting the reduction in the base tax rate for Americans in higher income brackets. The problem here is that there are certain taxpayers who are not in the higher tax brackets and may need those itemized deductions in order to lower their tax liability. In the end, they may actually see their federal income tax bill increase and not feel the proposed beneficial effect of Trump's plan.
Democrats believe the GOP's aggressive push for these sorts of laws may backfire, just as their yearslong campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act did in the 2018 elections.
To be sure, such attitudes aren't persuasive for everyone.

His standing has dropped in many national- and state-level polls, putting Warren and Harris within striking distance of his second-place standing, as all three scramble to overcome the substantial lead Biden continues to enjoy.

In an effort to regain his footing, Sanders has sought to emphasize to voters that while other candidates, including Warren and Harris, have adopted signature policies like Medicare for All, the integrity with which he would fight for them is unrivaled.
The 2015 deal Obama's State Department reached with Iran forced that nation to dismantle its nuclear enrichment program for at least a decade in return for the suspension of some economic sanctions. The deal's other signatories include France, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the European Union, Russia and China.
Their protests and efforts to make this into a huge deal is as likely to contribute to fear in the immigrant community as anything else, Vaughan said. Then, too, she said, the decline in food stamp enrollment could also be attributed to eligible family members leaving to be with loved ones who were deported.
In addition, the focus on New York City was bizarre. Notwithstanding an uptick in crime, including shootings and murders in recent months, New York City does not even break the top 25 most crime-ridden big cities. And though the city is in the grips of an uptick in crime that is cause for local concern, the Big Apple is on track to have far fewer violent crimes this year than it did under Giuliani.
Confronted Sunday morning on ABC's This Week with a fresh Trump tweet that transmitted a video from Trump's pro wrestling period, doctored to depict him pummeling a man whose head is a CNN microphone, Trump's White House terrorism advisor Thomas Bossert could have stayed in his lane, pivoting to talk of securing the homeland. Hell, he even could have criticized Trump's latest incitement to violence and attack on free speech (see 1, below). Instead, Bossert sucked up to his bellicose boss, insisting, falsely, No one would perceive that as a threat before adding, I hope they don't. Then Bossert, perhaps hoping Trump would applaud the TV appearance rather than throw his golf shoe at the screen, gushed, He's a genuine president expressing himself genuinely.
Wednesday's ruling was criticized by leading reproductive health and civil rights groups.
Harris' plan takes a middle-of-road approach, falling short of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sweeping plan to completely overhaul the nation's health insurance system, yet offering a bigger transformation to the nation's health care system than the reforms supported by former Vice President Joe Biden.
Mary watched racing cars and 1) didn't experience any PTSD and 2) looked like her whole body had been Botoxed.
As always, VP Pence makes the list for his rapturous gazes at Trump at every meaningless White House meeting and ceremony, and for generally working to validate this disgraceful president. And for not immediately defending his wife Karen Pence's honor when Trump told a July 4 White House gathering that he had never before heard the term second lady but that Mrs. Pence is some lady, that I can tell you.
The orders don't do anything about anything, though. It's just more vaporware from the Trump administration. Slogans, lies and exaggerations aren't policies. Trump pitched his phantom plan by saying it rests on three pillars: more choice, lower costs, and better care, and that it would put patients first.
So it makes sense that Donald Trump just named McCaughey to his team of economic advisers.
Former Vice President Joe Biden declared his overwhelming victory in the South Carolina primary with a forceful message for Democrats: that the party would lose big if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the Democratic nomination.
The Latest Blow, And Surely Not The Last One
At one point, Trump suggested that Clinton actually preferred to create a single-payer plan ― something that would come as a great shock to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who proposed a single-payer scheme during the Democratic primaries that Clinton attacked repeatedly. (Trump also suggested that single-payer plans are catastrophic in certain ways, even though those systems actually outperform the U.S. system by at least some metrics, while managing to provide truly universal coverage with significantly lower spending.)
Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.
Corporations stand to gain substantially since their tax rate would decrease from 35 to 15 percent. This is considered the most aggressive step in the Trump tax plan since the goal is to set the corporate tax rate on par or below that of other industrialized countries and, therefore, become more competitive. The objectives are to bring jobs to American shores, attract foreign capital, and incentivize global companies to establish subsidiaries or relocate to the United States while stimulating long-term economic growth.
The Affordable Care Act has its shortcomings and tradeoffs. Nobody, not even its staunchest defenders, think it's the ideal response to the problems of America's health care system.
But when Sanders walked onto the University of South Carolina stage to the adulation of some 1,000 supporters waving Medicare for Y'all placards, it was clear that he had his share of supporters here. Feeding on the crowd's energy, he dispensed with his detractors with a bit of gentle sarcasm.
He has not said publicly why he is leaving, and he has not responded to emails from media outlets, including HuffPost, which tried to contact him last week. But the circumstances and timing could indicate it is connected with the Affordable Care Act lawsuit.
President Joe Biden is set to begin his own victory lap this week, first by signing the law in a ceremony on Thursday and then by delivering a prime-time speech on the anniversary of the nation's COVID-19 shutdown. The White House is already promising Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and both of their spouses will hit the road to sell the plan nationally.
States would have to quickly decide whether to continue covering some or all of these adults with their own funds, according to Judy Solomon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It's doubtful many would be able to do that.
NextGen's announcement comes one day after the Biden campaign unveiled a new youth outreach effort, dubbed League 46. That effort, led by Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, includes an expansion of an existing Students for Biden group, along with the launch of groups of young professionals for Biden and young elected officials for Biden.
But some researchers at California Food Policy Advocates, a nonprofit based in Oakland, caution against drawing a conclusion between the implementation of the Secure Communities program and the drop-off in food stamp enrollment.
Whether Trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. Trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like NATO, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about NATO. In August 2015, Trump told NBC News that he learned military policy from the shows ― television news and interview programs.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Cruz.
Now my Republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the American people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
President Joe Biden is set to begin his own victory lap this week, first by signing the law in a ceremony on Thursday and then by delivering a prime-time speech on the anniversary of the nation's COVID-19 shutdown. The White House is already promising Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and both of their spouses will hit the road to sell the plan nationally.
And former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ― long hailed by conservative Gothamites for his heavy-handed approach to reducing crime in the 1990s ― described de Blasio as a taste of the kind of lawlessness-for-its-own-sake that Democrats supposedly want to visit on America.
What Republicans have to do is turn it into midnight basketball, he said, referring to a program Republicans attacked as frivolous in 1990s crime legislation. You have to say you support the bits of this that go to COVID relief, but detail the pork that's in there. (In 2010, Republicans attacked a stimulus-funded study that tested how monkeys reacted to cocaine.)
Among the established GOP presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.
What if Trump cuts off Medicare? What if he cuts off food stamps?
Trump's economic team feels that cutting taxes will help the American economy in order to reach their goal of 4 percent GDP growth. But the plan has some potential problems that outweigh the intended benefits.
But among Iowa's three GOP-held House seats, Democrats like their odds better in the 1st Congressional District, which includes Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, and the 3rd, which includes the Des Moines metropolitan area. Sanders' campaign did not reach out to the campaigns of Abby Finkenauer, the Democrat running in the 1st, or Cindy Axne, the nominee in the 3rd. While Finkenauer does not appear with out-of-state Democrats, Axne welcomed Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to a campaign rally on Monday.
Some of the administration's decisions have actually made it easier for people to buy comprehensive coverage, although by all accounts that was not intentional. In particular, the administration's decision to yank some of the subsidies that insurers get under the law ended up making coverage more affordable for some buyers, because it meant they were eligible for more financial assistance. But the administration has not stopped trying ― and that includes through the courts.
I think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised when they see the child tax credit and the fact that they will be getting essentially bonus checks to support their family based on how many children they have, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost. So I think really aggressively messaging the specific tangible aspects of this bill that everyday people can see and feel is what's most important.
Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. Only gets worse. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more and more money. We have almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It's very bad. Very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. One of the biggest line items very shortly.
Trump decried Obamacare as a disaster, giving a hyperbolic account of its flaws with zero acknowledgement of its virtues. Then the Republican nominee promised he'd give Americans the finest health care plan there is, even though he's never sketched out a detailed alternative.
At issue in Trump v. Pennsylvania, consolidated with Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, were new rules established by the Trump administration that vastly expanded the types of organizations that could opt out of the mandate based on religious beliefs or moral objections.
In truth, one federal district judge ― Rudolph Contreras ― in 2012 found fault with parts of the gainful employment rule, but that was an earlier, different version of the rule, and the judge nevertheless upheld the authority of the Department of Education to issue it. After that decision, the Department of Education undertook a brand-new rule-making process and issued a brand-new gainful employment rule that eliminated the provisions that Contreras rejected. When the for-profit college industry then challenged the new rule in court, two other federal district judges and three federal appeals judges all upheld the rule in its entirety. Then, last week, Judge Contreras issued a narrow ruling in yet another industry lawsuit, directing the Department to give certain cosmetology programs that had sued more flexibility to file appeals of adverse results, but the judge noted that his order avoids upending the entire GE regulatory scheme.
Gardner has justified that claim by pointing to the Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act, a bill he sponsored. But the entire legislation is barely 100 words long and is basically just a slogan, as multiple analysts pointed out.
And as much as Republicans point to Tillis' bill as evidence of their desire to protect people with preexisting conditions, it has little chance of passing in a divided Senate. Moreover, experts say it would allow insurers to exclude coverage of some preexisting conditions anyway, calling its provisions a mirage.
I'm going home to do my research, she said after Biden spoke.
Why The Health Care Debate Isn't Going Away
But one difference between the fight over the Affordable Care Act versus abortion was that on the ACA, most of the battle was in Congress ― and getting rid of GOP members who wanted to repeal the law. But on abortion, much of the fight rests with the Supreme Court, symbolized by the fact that the protest was on the steps of the institution Tuesday.
We can have a president who wants 100% clean energy, student debt forgiveness and an assault weapons ban, or we can have a white supremacist who tells Americans to drink bleach, said Ben Wessel, the group's executive director. This election is about young Americans and our future, and the choice for us is clear: Joe Biden is the best candidate for president.
At the flagship protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., hundreds of men and women showed up for abortion rights. Democratic presidential candidates including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg all came as well.
Another possible GOP partner was Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who had worked closely with the top ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, Montana's Max Baucus, on the Medicare drug program under President George W. Bush. They had a close relationship and, at a private meeting of several senators that Baucus convened just after the election in 2008, Grassley said, I haven't heard anything here I don't like … I can't think of an issue that isn't compromise-able, according to the notes one participant took.
But the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions Republican leaders have attached to any Affordable Care Act stabilization proposal. And by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.
In truth, one federal district judge ― Rudolph Contreras ― in 2012 found fault with parts of the gainful employment rule, but that was an earlier, different version of the rule, and the judge nevertheless upheld the authority of the Department of Education to issue it. After that decision, the Department of Education undertook a brand-new rule-making process and issued a brand-new gainful employment rule that eliminated the provisions that Contreras rejected. When the for-profit college industry then challenged the new rule in court, two other federal district judges and three federal appeals judges all upheld the rule in its entirety. Then, last week, Judge Contreras issued a narrow ruling in yet another industry lawsuit, directing the Department to give certain cosmetology programs that had sued more flexibility to file appeals of adverse results, but the judge noted that his order avoids upending the entire GE regulatory scheme.
The guidance under Obama... meant that a state's plan couldn't result in fewer people enrolled in affordable, comprehensive coverage, Corlette explained. This new guidance is saying that so long as people in the state have 'access' to [comprehensive] coverage, it doesn't matter what they actually do... If un-insurance spikes or there's a big movement to [less comprehensive plans] a state won't get dinged for that.
Still, anxiety remains, even in sanctuary cities. Earlier this year, Reuters reported the Trump administration was considering making it harder for immigrants to get a green card if they or their U.S.-born children used public assistance programs such as food stamps. Advocates say that sent many immigrants into a panic.
That's not a plan. It's a plan to come up with a plan that won't work because the White House can't just order hospitals not to bill people. Again, that's why lawmaking exists.
The latest uproar came after Alabama passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the country last week, banning the procedure with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. Seven other states have also passed new anti-abortion laws, with additional measures pending in state legislatures.
Right there in the text, it says health insurance companies would not be allowed to deny an individual coverage or charge extra because of health status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, [or] any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services].
For Trump's true believers, it is precisely that bulldog nature that makes him such a draw. Standing outside the hotel where the conference was held, Nigel Farage ― the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, Brexit champion and closest approximation to Trump that England can offer ― scoffed at a query about what Trump might do to possibly disappoint.
Now its control of the Senate in doubt, and the Affordable Care Act is a top issue again, thanks in part to a new lawsuit challenging its constitutionality that the Supreme Court is expected to hear in November ― quite possibly, with Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett in the seat that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg once occupied.
That promise would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep if the Trump administration weakens or eliminates the mandate on its own, before a new health care system is in place.
Welcome to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In a warm-up for an anticipated second run by Sanders, he's been promoting the party's prospects in the Nov. 6 elections during a nine-state campaign swing that began in Bloomington, Indiana, on Oct. 19 and wraps up in Oakland, California, this Saturday. He'll be joined on that last stop by Rep. Barbara Lee of California, a fellow progressive stalwart running for chair of the House Democratic Caucus.
Whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. Trump has already ignored U.S. allies on tariffs and the Paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.
WASHINGTON — It's that time of the week — food pantry day — and before the doors even open at the Spanish Catholic Center, the patrons begin queueing up, lugging roller carts and empty grocery bags, the line stretching out onto the hot sidewalk. Immigrants all, they hail from the Congo and Costa Rica, from Nicaragua and El Salvador, from Togo and Vietnam. Most are seniors.
After eight years of Barack Obama and tax-and-spend economics, a Republican who doesn't do a very good job would have to do a really bad job to anger the movement, said Cody Leach, of Maryland. We have to be a faithful party because we are faithful servants. We have to lead him [Trump] to the light.

KC McGinnis / Reuters Sen. Kamala Harris of California is among other Democrats viewed as a presidential contender in 2020.
Sen. Lamar Alexander's office declined to comment on what Congress should do on health care, saying they had nothing to add at this time. The Tennessee Republican is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee in the senate. Offices for Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mike Braun (Indiana) and Rob Portman (Ohio), who sit on either the HELP committee or the Senate Finance Committee, which collectively have purview over Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare, did not respond to requests for comment.
The problem for advocates of Medicare for All isn't simply the Republicans in the Senate, who have called it socialism and pledged to fight it tooth and nail. A number of more conservative and centrist-minded Democratic senators remain uncomfortable with the idea, preferring instead more immediate measures that would bolster the insurance market under Obamacare.
Millions Would Lose Insurance, Insurance Protections
Pretty scary! And totally untrue. Completely, 100 percent false. Zero correspondence with reality. But McCaughey's nonsense took off. She made the same claim in op-eds for The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. When Sarah Palin picked up the idea, the mandatory meetings morphed into Obama's death panel. Conservative media and Republican politicians went wild.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) who ended her presidential campaign in December, took an early shot at Biden's record on race, attacking the former vice president on his stance on integrated busing in the 1970s. But Biden appeared to have weathered that attack.
And Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, launched the first ads of a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote the Biden-Harris-Democratic agenda. The digital ads, running in the swing states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, contrast the GOP support for the Trump-era tax cuts with the party's unified opposition to the COVID-19 relief bill.
Trav Robertson, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, criticized party colleagues who blasted Sanders for his visit and said he welcomed the visit.
Graham said it would be a nice gesture for Ivanka & Jared to attend, but cleared it w/ Cindy McCain first, Rogers tweeted, referring to McCain's widow.

When did Aetna first determine that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of Humana?
So, again, his plan is to not have a plan. If he had one, he would tell us.
Getty Images Chief Justice John Roberts (right) has twice joined more liberal justices to save the Affordable Care Act. But now he would need at least one more conservative to join him, putting the focus on newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett (right).
Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on Iran and other countries in his Fox News appearances. And newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a Kansas congressman in December 2015, told a Westminster Institute audience that the only real solution in Iran was the abolition of the current regime.
AOL Trump's former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo aboard.
Sponsors of private employer plans, through which roughly half of all Americans get insurance, could once again impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, since it's the Affordable Care Act that made such limits illegal. That could really hammer patients with rare forms of cancer or congenital conditions, such as hemophilia, for which treatments can easily exceed $1 million per year or sometimes even per month.
According to a poll conducted last month by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 64 percent of Americans surveyed said they do not want the courts to do this, with 62 percent of respondents saying a candidate's position on pre-existing conditions is very important or the most important factor in whom they will support.
I think the government should pay the doctors instead of putting that money in an insurance company, she said.
One hint to how the Supreme Court might vote on this case comes from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who in recent rulings indicated he supports the traditional notion of severability. That might suggest he's inclined to leave the rest of the Affordable Care Act in place, even if he buys the argument that the mandate has now become unconstitutional.
Nhai Nguyen, 68, has been in the United States since 1991. She's retired now, and her 74-year-old husband is blind. Food stamps only take them but so far, she said, so they come to the food pantry at the Spanish Catholic Center. She worries constantly, she said, even though she is a naturalized citizen.
Single-payer advocates also pointed out that the Rules Committee worked with Jayapal and Sanders, and these advocates also believe the final witnesses aren't bad. They just wish there were someone who would more forcefully make the case for Medicare for All.
James, who has an MBA from the University of Michigan and works in his family's supply chain business, has played up his credentials as both a businessman and a fresh-faced, energetic outsider. It may be working.
Don't let Democrats do to America what they've done to New York, Giuliani said, declaring that Republicans were the true anti-racists for their vigilance against the ordinary crime that kills so many Black residents of major cities. For President Trump and for us Republicans, all Black lives matter.
The news capped a week of chaotic activity at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, as Trump, Ryan and their lieutenants tried desperately to round up votes for the measure they introduced less than three weeks ago ― which they were attempting to move through the legislative process at breakneck speed.
There is a heated debate right now about what is this best way forward, Adam Gaffney, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program told HuffPost. Medicare for All is one proposal. Medicare for All is the best proposal. Is someone going to make that case?
Just about the only thing clear right now are the policy stakes. And they are significant.
These numbers have fed the perception that Trump is a sui generis type of political figure ― one whose avid base will stick by him regardless of foible or misstep. It's a perception that Trump himself has pushed, famously declaring that he could stand in the Middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any votes.
Steve Ricchetti, Biden's campaign chairman, has lobbied for major pharmaceutical companies. Biden's campaign has also received contributions from 15 pharmaceutical and health insurance company executives.
No, it did not — although, contrary to what some Republicans say now, it was not for Democrats' lack of effort. In addition to believing in bipartisanship as a virtue, Obama could count votes, especially in the Senate, where a small-state bias gave conservative states disproportionate power ― and where the filibuster was becoming a de facto, 60-vote requirement for all legislation.
Perhaps most consequentially, the administration has partially sided with a group of Republican state officials seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act on constitutional grounds.
I am half-Black and President Obama was half-Black and I know when I see a Black person and a white person who can genuinely get along with one another, she said.
After Iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser Michael Flynn went before the White House press corps to deliver a bellicose response. But just hours later, top National Security Council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that Iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the United States would continue to comply as well.
You can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass, Obama said. And that can't be how any democracy functions over time. If you ask me what has contributed to the cynicism ― of government, and to some degree what contributed to the cynicism around the health care initiative ― it's the fact that a small minority of people can put a halt to everything.
It's hard to draw a direct cause and effect, Call said. They don't ask you why you're disenrolling.
Now my Republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the American people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
The Trump administration is touting this possibility as proof that it is improving choice and affordability ― and, in the words of Seema Verma, the Trump administration official in charge of overseeing federal health programs, that it is working to mitigate the damage of Obamacare.
WASHINGTON ― It's supposed to be the first congressional hearing ever on Medicare for All ― a huge win for single-payer advocates and progressives in Congress. But next week, when the House Rules Committee holds that landmark hearing on the expansive health care legislation, Medicare for All advocates may actually be getting screwed.
When we get rid of those lines, you have competition and we'll be able to keep pre-existing and help people that can't get, don't have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way. Believe it or not and strongly this way. We're going to block grant. Into the states. Block grant into medicaid. So we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
With the new medical center, Prince George's County hopes to end its long-time reliance on $30 million annually from public subsidies to help cover operations. But that goal assumed Obamacare would remain intact, said Thomas Himler, Prince George's deputy chief administrative officer.
But there was little in the speech that the Trump campaign had not tried before without success.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Visitors to the Department of Labor March 18 are turned away at the door by personnel due to closures over coronavirus concerns in New York. A record-high number of people applied for unemployment benefits as layoffs engulfed the United States.
Those conservative Democrats were the ones who were dead set against the public option. They were the ones who kept pushing to give state officials more power over the program. They were the ones most anxious over new spending. And those decisions had consequences later, when the law took effect. Among other things, it meant less financial assistance for some middle-class Americans buying insurance.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld rules issued by the Trump administration that allow employers with religious or moral objections to deny women access to free birth control coverage.
There is a heated debate right now about what is this best way forward, Adam Gaffney, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program told HuffPost. Medicare for All is one proposal. Medicare for All is the best proposal. Is someone going to make that case?
Two years later and still bashing the agreement, Trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the Iranian nuclear program.
Not all hospitals are on hold. Some healthcare groups in areas with growing populations, such as Atlanta and Houston, are pushing ahead with capital expansion projects. Others, such as Maryland's Prince George's County, are still planning to move forward with construction plans, thanks in part to a partnership with the University of Maryland Medical System.
The gravest threat to the ACA's promise that even people who've been sick can get health insurance is a lawsuit brought by Republican officials in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The attorneys general in these states, most with the approval of their GOP governors, are trying to get the entire Affordable Care Act thrown out on dubious grounds.
In Houston, at the Epiphany Community Health Outreach Services, a local nonprofit that works with the immigrant community, SNAP enrollment dropped by a third compared with this time last year. Meanwhile, participation in the food pantry program increased 266 percent, according to the center.
In keeping with Sanders' base-centric approach to turning his campaign's tide, he stuck to his standard populist script on Wednesday, mixing moral denunciations of corporate greed with snarky asides and paeans to the social democratic reforms of the mid-20th century. He insisted that the current health care system, in which millions of Americans go without the care they need as insurance executives earn multimillion-dollar compensation packages, is the result of corporate capture of the political system.
It's very disturbing and it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular ― Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, McConnell told Bloomberg TV. Hopefully at some point here we'll get serious about this, he said. McConnell went on to lament that it was a shame Obama and Congress weren't able to figure out how to ruin these programs together and bizarrely asserted that total GOP control of the federal government somehow made this more difficult.
But the gambit failed, and it failed spectacularly.
And for all of their bluster, Trump and his advisers might be worried about the consequences of weakening the mandate.
With Democrats out of power in Washington, there's been no chance his most ambitious ideas could become law. But there's also clear evidence his proposals have picked up steam among Democrats.
This is playing out in Arizona, where Kingman Regional Medical Center is taking cost-cutting measures by renegotiating medical supply and service contracts. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System, which includes six hospitals, is largely holding off hiring non-clinical staff, a trend also evident in national data.
James, a 39-year-old West Point graduate who flew Apache helicopters in Iraq, is a rare bright spot in what's been a dismal campaign season for the Republican Party nationally. Trump's chances of winning reelection seem lower every day, and the GOP's 53-47 Senate majority is in jeopardy, with incumbents from even strongly conservative states, including Georgia and South Carolina, suddenly looking vulnerable.
We're now almost 10 years into it, so I deal with the world we're in, and so let's figure out an offramp that addresses some of the underlying issues about the cost of health care while also providing more access to health insurance for people on the individual market that still can't afford health insurance that have preexisting conditions, McSally said.

The incumbent in Michigan isn't a Republican, however. It's Democrat Gary Peters, a well-liked but not especially well-known former investment adviser who has spent nearly 30 years in politics ― as a city councilor, state senator, lottery commissioner and then a U.S. House member before succeeding Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in 2015.
The energy we saw around this day of action was even bigger than what we saw in the early days of Kavanaugh because what we said then is becoming real to people, which is: They're going for broke, said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. And that doesn't mean just overturning Roe. It means criminalizing abortion, challenging rape, trying to control women. Women all over the country see that as a very real threat now.
The kids are born U.S. citizens, he says. They have a right to get food. We're going to have a huge population that will struggle. We might not see it now, but we will in 20 years, when these kids come into the workforce.
Reconciliation rules stipulate that only provisions with a direct effect on the federal budget may get consideration through this process. That could exclude many of the regulatory changes that more conservative Republicans want to make, like changes to rules regarding what insurance covers. These rules also require the legislation, on net, to reduce the budget deficit.
What we have found is not that people are so crazy about Joe Biden. It's that they really love President Obama. Shaun King, a civil rights activist and surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
Even the likely targets of bipartisan outreach said that during the course of the entire process they never heard from Trump. A spokesman for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said a call never came.
What did White House national security adviser General McMaster do? Simply, he told reporters, regarding Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, There's no specific agenda — it's really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about. General, you're supposed to be protecting Americans, not scaring the fuck out of us.
Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the opinion, said that the Trump administration had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
The reality is that Republicans have never produced alternatives to Obamacare that live up to their lofty rhetoric. They didn't in 2017 and they aren't now.
ASSOCIATED PRESS/Patrick Semansky Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate, speaks about Medicare for All on Wednesday in Washington.
With Obamacare repeal off the legislative agenda ― for now, at least ― why would these senators write legislation to solve a problem that doesn't exist? Because their party is the middle of unsolving it.
That keeps many from signing up for food stamps and other public assistance even when they're eligible, said Monestel, who has lived here for decades as a legal permanent resident.
This is a shameful decision from the Supreme Court, said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. Denying employees and students coverage for birth control will limit their ability to decide whether and when to have a family and make other decisions about their futures. And it will exacerbate existing inequalities, falling hardest on people with the fewest resources and people of color.
One Sentence Could Make The Case Go Away
While Republicans won back the House in 2010 with a message focused, at least in part, on outrage over wasteful government spending, it's unclear if that message will work as well with the party's culture war-focused Trump-era coalition, which includes more voters without a college degree. (The Pew survey found lower-income Republicans were more likely to support the Rescue Act then their wealthier counterparts were.)
Later Trump suggested that Clinton's solution, providing more financial assistance to people with higher expenses, was a bad idea because the country already has almost $20 trillion in debt. But Clinton has called for raising taxes on wealthy Americans in order to pay for her new initiatives, including the proposed health care assistance, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ― an independent organization that is obsessive about reducing the deficit ― has concluded she's identified enough specific revenue to pay for nearly her entire agenda.
But Trump's hold on the crowd had as much to do with party as personality. People at CPAC approved of Trumpism as much as, if not more than, Trump himself. And their loyalty to the party was, perhaps, supreme.

While Primus told staffers the reason they needed to find witnesses who had not spoken poorly of the ACA was because they didn't want Republicans using the hearing as an opportunity to attack Obamacare, sources believe there were ulterior motives.
Those conservative Democrats were the ones who were dead set against the public option. They were the ones who kept pushing to give state officials more power over the program. They were the ones most anxious over new spending. And those decisions had consequences later, when the law took effect. Among other things, it meant less financial assistance for some middle-class Americans buying insurance.

During his visit earlier this week, Macron tried to appeal to Trump's fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and Iran's role in funding regional conflicts. Merkel is to repeat that message Friday, according to Western European diplomats.

The latest uproar came after Alabama passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the country last week, banning the procedure with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. Seven other states have also passed new anti-abortion laws, with additional measures pending in state legislatures.

Among the many political realities of 2009 frequently forgotten today are that Democrats had only 58 Senate seats for the first few months, because of litigation over Minnesota's close Senate race (eventually Democrat Al Franken won the seat) and because Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was still a Republican (eventually he switched parties).
This time, Democrats insist, will be different. The $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, dubbed the American Rescue Plan, provides far more direct relief to Americans than the 2009 legislation. The White House, full of veterans of President Barack Obama's administration, and Democratic outside groups are preparing to wage an extended political battle to make sure voters appreciate the aid they're receiving.
The second major lie was that Biden supports efforts to eliminate police budgets, part of Trump's efforts to portray Biden ― a veteran politician with a clear center-left ideology and track record ― as a stalking-horse for the left-most elements of the Democratic Party. If you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America, Trump said.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Thom Tillis's bill allows him to say he stands with Trump on Obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.

Trump decried Obamacare as a disaster, giving a hyperbolic account of its flaws with zero acknowledgement of its virtues. Then the Republican nominee promised he'd give Americans the finest health care plan there is, even though he's never sketched out a detailed alternative.
Obamacare Repeal Still On The Agenda
It's gotta be replaced, Tillis said of Obamacare last week, before brushing off the coming onslaught of health care ads against him in 2020. The North Carolina Republican warned Democrats and their allies planning on taking him on that they would do so at their own peril because the fact of the matter is the Affordable Care Act is not popular.
This time, activists see a turning point with not just Alabama, but with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, solidifying a 5-4 conservative majority. The threat of the court overturning Roe v. Wade is suddenly real.
The law's protections for people with preexisting conditions would no longer be in effect, less-visible reforms covering everything from billing fraud to food calorie postings would vanish, and the entire health care system could plunge into chaos.
What someone promises to do doesn't mean a whole lot, Huffmon said. Now primary voters tend to be more educated on the issues, and more passionate, but a lot of voters do retrospective voting. In the past they judged Obama as good, and that's who they trusted and Biden is linked to him.
While Primus told staffers the reason they needed to find witnesses who had not spoken poorly of the ACA was because they didn't want Republicans using the hearing as an opportunity to attack Obamacare, sources believe there were ulterior motives.
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. Only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn't that simple. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated, he said in February 2017.
House Republican leaders on Friday pulled their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, signaling defeat on what was supposed to be a major legislative accomplishment for President Donald Trump.
The standard deduction will double, affecting all taxpayers. As the law now stands, single individuals can deduct $6,350 from their taxable income while married couples deduct $12,700. Trump proposes that individuals will deduct $12,700 while married couples can write off $25,400. The proposed benefits are that average taxpayers will pay less taxes if they do not have itemized deductions and simplify tax return preparation without the use of an accountant or preparer.
Those of us who are 70-plus, we'll take care of ourselves, but don't sacrifice the country, he said, adding that he was not living in fear of COVID-19. What I'm living in fear of is what's happening to this country.
When did Aetna first inform investors that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of Humana? What other risks did the company disclose to investors?
How Trump Could Weaken The Mandate
When asked about the early signs of hospitals putting spending on hold, a White House spokesperson expressed confidence that the disastrous Obamacare law will be replaced with the American Health Care Act — the vehicle which will reform our broken healthcare system.
But the most telling part of Trump's answer was when he described his alternative. After making the case for allowing cross-state purchase of insurance ― which would potentially lower premiums, but only by allowing insurers to escape existing regulations on benefits and sales practices ― Trump said the following:
President Donald Trump was famously not invited to the memorial service of Sen. John McCain, which took place Saturday at the National Cathedral in Washington. The president's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance, however.
Confronted Sunday morning on ABC's This Week with a fresh Trump tweet that transmitted a video from Trump's pro wrestling period, doctored to depict him pummeling a man whose head is a CNN microphone, Trump's White House terrorism advisor Thomas Bossert could have stayed in his lane, pivoting to talk of securing the homeland. Hell, he even could have criticized Trump's latest incitement to violence and attack on free speech (see 1, below). Instead, Bossert sucked up to his bellicose boss, insisting, falsely, No one would perceive that as a threat before adding, I hope they don't. Then Bossert, perhaps hoping Trump would applaud the TV appearance rather than throw his golf shoe at the screen, gushed, He's a genuine president expressing himself genuinely.
Not so long ago, I got to interview an expert on the matter: President Obama himself.
Glenn Beck, the conservative pundit, made a similar case on his radio show: I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, said Beck, who is 56. I would rather die than kill the country. 'Cause it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country.
Among the established GOP presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.
These plans typically cover a lot less than the sorts of plans available through the Affordable Care Act. They may have weak coverage of prescriptions, if they have any at all, and leave out mental health altogether. Usually they do not cover pre-existing conditions and are often not available to people who have them.
The Republican argument against Obamacare - with which Mister Ip closes his article - is not wrong. I am sorry to report that Obamacare, in its current incarnation, does function as a tax on the middle class to subsidize healthcare for the lower class. But when the white male CEOs of all of the major health insurance companies earn $10 million to $15 million dollars per year and their companies are leaving the healthcare exchanges because they are supposedly losing money, is it really the lower class citizens who are bilking the system?
Trump also turned a holiday concert that was supposed to salute service members and veterans into a tribute to himself, gloating that the fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not.
I'm not going to vote for him because he and Barack are friends, said Phyllis Pelzer, 53, of Orangeburg. A lot of Black people see Biden as a good guy because he was Obama's guy, but I don't care nothing about that. All of em' got some Black friends somewhere. You can't win because you have a Black friend.
Simply declaring in an executive order that people with preexisting conditions should be able to buy health insurance if the high court knocks down the ACA is entirely meaningless. If it were that simple, some other president would have done it already and become extremely popular. More than that, no president can just order an entire industry to not do something. That's why there's a Congress that passes laws.
The defendant in the case is the U.S. government, because the Affordable Care Act is a federal law. Customarily, the Justice Department would file a brief arguing why the states are wrong, since it is part of the executive branch and defending federal statutes in court is part of the executive's constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
WASHINGTON ― One month into his presidency, Donald Trump's popularity has begun tanking with every constituency, save one.
But, by that point, the politics of health care in Michigan was shifting in the same way it was shifting nationwide. Voters started to appreciate what the Affordable Care Act, for all of its flaws, had achieved. And they got angry at Republicans for trying to take those things away.
According to a poll conducted last month by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 64 percent of Americans surveyed said they do not want the courts to do this, with 62 percent of respondents saying a candidate's position on pre-existing conditions is very important or the most important factor in whom they will support.
The bills Republicans produced that year would have weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions while leaving many millions without insurance, as independent analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office, confirmed.
That means the mandate is an unconstitutional command, according to the lawsuit. And because the law's component parts are so interconnected, the lawsuit says, the whole thing has to come off the books.
Verma, who addressed reporters in a conference call Monday, insisted that the new rules would not hurt people with pre-existing conditions. In so doing, she echoed claims that Trump and countless Republican candidates for federal and state office have made with increasing insistence over the past few weeks, as their longstanding support for repealing the Affordable Care Act has become a clear, possibly fatal political liability.
But it's what the bill doesn't say that makes the above mostly meaningless.
The National Bureau of Economic Research study found that in the decade before Donald Trump took office, there might have been a correlation between deportation fears and the drop-off in the number of Latino immigrants enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as food stamps, and the Affordable Care Act insurance program, also known as Obamacare.
The Pew Charitable Trusts Marchers this month at a rally in Washington, D.C., protesting the arrests of immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Advocates say stepped-up immigration enforcement has contributed to a climate of fear in the immigrant community. Many eligible immigrants, they say, are choosing to forgo food stamps, even though they are entitled to receive them.
Take Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley (R), who's trying to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in November. Hawley is one of the plaintiffs in the suit. He's going around simultaneously saying that the lawsuit is good and that McCaskill is lying when she says he's attacking protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who approved his state's participation in the legal action against the ACA, called bringing the suit doing the right thing while posting videos about his deep commitment to people with pre-existing conditions (he's running for re-election). There's a lot of this going around on the campaign trail.
Across the industry, hospital jobs so far in 2017 grew by 8,775 monthly on average, compared to 11,413 jobs for the same period last year, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. (Graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2mtyO0w)
They probably would have looked at it and thought: What's best for the country? he said. I don't know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.
Trump is once again trapped in the unique New York City culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, when he first tried his hand at right-wing demagoguery. In 1989, Trump took out a full-page ad in New York City newspapers calling for the state to revive the death penalty to punish the Central Park Five ― a group of Black and Latino teenagers accused of raping a woman in Manhattan. When the young men were exonerated by DNA evidence decades later, Trump declined to apologize for whipping up public sentiment against them.
But again, Nahvi's testimony is also supposed to be limited to patient experience, and advocates don't believe he'll be able to make a forceful case for single-payer because of limitations with his expertise.
Fixing The Senate ― And Democracy
Put more simply, conservatives worried that repeal didn't go far enough, while moderates worried that it went too far. Every effort Republican leaders made to appease one group alienated the other.
Last year's cut forced navigators to lay off staff, cancel events, and, in some cases, cease operations altogether. This new cut will leave navigators with just a fraction of the money they had available for the open enrollment periods that occurred during President Barack Obama's administration ― in all likelihood hampering their ability to help consumers through the complicated process of choosing a health insurance policy and applying for financial assistance.
To be sure, it's hard to make a clear comparison between Medicaid expansion and growing numbers of uninsured, especially because health care providers have only recently begun loosening restrictions around preventative care checkups and other services that were deemed nonessential during the early weeks of the pandemic.
Trump is again this week's number one in Republic Report's Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings. Trump is not merely a disgrace; he's a total and complete disgrace.
But among Iowa's three GOP-held House seats, Democrats like their odds better in the 1st Congressional District, which includes Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, and the 3rd, which includes the Des Moines metropolitan area. Sanders' campaign did not reach out to the campaigns of Abby Finkenauer, the Democrat running in the 1st, or Cindy Axne, the nominee in the 3rd. While Finkenauer does not appear with out-of-state Democrats, Axne welcomed Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to a campaign rally on Monday.
A highly respected career lawyer at the Justice Department has decided to resign just days after the Trump administration backed a controversial lawsuit that would wreck part of the Affordable Care Act.
But a lack of action on health care could have its own political consequences. If the polls are right, voters will hold Republicans, not Democrats, responsible for problems with the Affordable Care Act ― and for problems with health care more generally.
Despite Biden's strength at the grassroots level among Black voters, groups that represent Black activists and other minorities haven't lined up behind him. The Florida-based racial justice group Dream Defenders endorsed Sanders, as did Center for Popular Democracy Action, a network of progressive community organizers looking to mobilize Black and Latinx voters. The Center for Urban and Racial Equity gave Biden an F rating on its 2020 scorecard, saying the most of Biden's plans do not explicitly mention race or racial inequity.
I strongly doubt he understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement, said Richard Nephew, a top State Department official in charge of Iran sanctions during the period the agreement was being negotiated.
Glenn Beck, the conservative pundit, made a similar case on his radio show: I would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, said Beck, who is 56. I would rather die than kill the country. 'Cause it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country.
Steve Ricchetti, Biden's campaign chairman, has lobbied for major pharmaceutical companies. Biden's campaign has also received contributions from 15 pharmaceutical and health insurance company executives.
This kind of mobilization can actually make the GOP think twice about how hard they want to push because they know that they're losing women in droves right now, and they know that their political fate for decades to come is on the line, she told HuffPost.
According to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that favors limited immigration, if the decline in SNAP enrollment is a result of the Secure Communities program, that could be because of the overreaction among the groups that work with immigrants in the community.
Those focus-group-tested slogans sound great! Except they're hogwash.
The battle could play a key role in determining control of the Senate in 2020. McSally, for instance, is facing a stiff Democratic challenge from former astronaut Mark Kelly, who is married to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Democrats need to pick up at least three seats to gain control of Congress' upper chamber and have any hope of enacting the party's agenda.
That said, Sarah Miller, a health economist with University of Michigan, pointed out there are still real financial and health impacts.
Although the details of the argument evolved over time, the gist was always the same: Obamacare would ration treatments for society's most vulnerable members, like the disabled and the elderly, because their lives wouldn't be deemed worth the expense of saving.
And a political threat continues to loom over Obamacare, The Republican Congress is again vowing to develop a plan to replace the law, although they've made little noticeable progress since Obama signed the ACA six years ago this month.
I'd stand behind him until he is impeached, said Eric Finch of West Virginia. Because he is my president and I respect the office and the process. I'd probably go out and call for his impeachment if he shot someone. But there has to be a process. And I imagine there would be a story. Maybe the guy attacked him, or Secret Service wasn't there.
Over and over again, GOP leaders argued that their proposal represented the party's best chance to kill Obamacare. But efforts to corral Republicans failed, in part because leaders were dealing with two separate groups with divergent interests.
Permanent spoiler alert: We simply can't imagine anyone other than Donald J. Trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. But we won't get tired of him winning. Believe me.
That's why insurers are jacking up prices this year and why big commercial insurers are pulling out of some markets altogether. In some parts of the country, consumers have only one insurance option. Meanwhile, even many of the insured still face high out-of-pocket costs ― and are finding the only affordable plans have narrow networks of providers.
Reconciliation rules stipulate that only provisions with a direct effect on the federal budget may get consideration through this process. That could exclude many of the regulatory changes that more conservative Republicans want to make, like changes to rules regarding what insurance covers. These rules also require the legislation, on net, to reduce the budget deficit.
In a statement, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who challenged the Trump rules, said he was disappointed in the ruling but was not giving up. We now return to the lower courts to address whether the exemptions are arbitrary and capricious, he said. This fight is not over. In a dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a stark warning about the potential impact of the ruling on employees.
The public still holds largely partisan views on the health reform law, and opinions have remained relatively unchanged since the Republican efforts to repeal it. But according to recent Democratic polling, the electorate still prefers Congressional Democrats' approach to the issue over congressional Republicans' approach by a double-digit margin.
The Affordable Care Act is responsible for historic progress, bringing the number of uninsured Americans to a record low, thereby improving access to care and bolstering financial security. But millions of people are unhappy with their coverage, and in some states, newly regulated insurance markets have struggled ― with premiums rising even higher and insurers, stung by financial losses, pulling up stakes.
Permanent spoiler alert: We simply can't imagine anyone other than Donald J. Trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. But we won't get tired of him winning. Believe me.
I feel like a rabbit in a cage, said Marta, 62, who moved to the United States from El Salvador 16 years ago, and didn't want her surname used because she is living here illegally. Added Maria Monestel, an 81-year-old babysitter from Costa Rica, Everyone is scared. They think they don't have any rights.
Is it a farce? It probably is, but no one wants to say that, this person said, on the condition of anonymity.

This is the lowest rate that we have seen since we started keeping these records, Obama said. We're not going backwards. We're not going to go back to a time where people could be denied because of pre-existing conditions. That's not who we are. That's who we were.

Digital First Media/Longmont Times-Call/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) greets supporters in Boulder, Colorado, on Wednesday. As he campaigns on behalf of the Democratic cause in this year's midterms, he's also gearing up for another White House run.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and current Speaker Paul Ryan, for example, built their conservative reputations and bases of power with sweeping plans to dismantle the federal safety net, and they have many acolytes. The main difference between those GOP leaders and President Donald Trump is that the latter is even more brazen in his lies about what he plans to do.
For instance, as the law steamed toward final passage on Wednesday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee ― which is partially under McConnell's control ― pressured Democratic Senate candidates on whether transgender women should be eligible to play sports, not on whether they supported the COVID-19 relief bill.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions mysteriously cancelled his speech set for today (Thursday) in Philadelphia to discuss his heavy-handed efforts to pressure so-called sanctuary cities to stop providing protections for undocumented immigrants.
Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) contested the question of criteria for witnesses. He told HuffPost in a statement that the committee had free [rein] to make all decisions about this hearing.
Of course, he may is not the same as he will. And Trump's executive order didn't change policy or otherwise commit the administration to a course of action. It was simply a statement of intent. The president and his deputies are under no obligation to follow through.
The battle over the soon-to-be law, however, could determine the political future for both parties. Democrats are all but certain to lose ground in Congress in a 2022 midterm, but limiting those losses could give Biden additional opportunities to push progressive policies. Republicans, meanwhile, need to pin down an anti-Biden message and see if fiscal conservatism resonates with their base and the broader electorate the same way it did a decade ago.
I often say that knowing when to leave a party is an Art Form.
No! Sanders replied. I'm just waking up.
What steps did Aetna take, prior to July 2016, to mitigate the risk that the Justice Department would challenge or successfully block its proposed acquisition of Humana?
Millions Would Lose Insurance, Insurance Protections
Furthermore, some of the Republicans involved in this pre-existing conditions mess are particularly vulnerable.
But it's no wonder why Trump and many Republicans running for office this year would try to make voters see something that's not there and deceive people about what the GOP actually wants to do to the U.S. health care system.
Palin, who has a child with Down syndrome, went on to say, The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.
The idea was to make sure healthy people enrolled before they got sick, so they would have protection against bills, so that they wouldn't require charity care that would raise costs throughout the system, and so that insurers could keep premiums low and stable.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the new proposal would cause 14 million people to lose health insurance next year and 24 million by 2026. The bill has divided House and Senate Republicans and sparked fierce criticism from Democrats and leading medical and hospital groups, including the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association. (Graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)
In general, the political effect of conventions has been declining for years as partisanship and polarization has risen, and the Democratic convention provided little boost for Biden's campaign. Expect the polls, and the voters they survey, to give Trump the same treatment.
What remains intact are deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, the two most popular among American taxpayers. Touching these deductions would most likely hurt the housing market and home values, and non-profit organizations relying on donations to survive.
The Trump administration is touting this possibility as proof that it is improving choice and affordability ― and, in the words of Seema Verma, the Trump administration official in charge of overseeing federal health programs, that it is working to mitigate the damage of Obamacare.
Congressional GOP leaders are playing the same game. In an interview with Bloomberg TV this month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) used one side of his mouth to say, There's nobody in the Senate that I'm familiar with who is not in favor of coverage of pre-existing conditions, and the other side to say, I don't fault the administration for trying to give us an opportunity to do this differently and to go in a different direction.
Some struggle to pay premiums, while others decide not to get insurance altogether. Those problems are likely to get even worse next year, because the 2017 Republican tax bill eliminated the penalty for people who don't get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get insurance, causing premiums to rise.
And then on Sunday, Conway got a little more specific.
Staff for Susan Collins referred HuffPost to previous comments the Maine senator made to Bangor Daily News that she was disappointed in President Donald Trump for not allowing a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act, but did not comment on Congress taking further action on health care specifically.
In some states, cuts would happen automatically because the executive actions or laws authorizing expansion call for restoring the pre-expansion eligibility standards if the extra federal funds stop flowing.
What The GOP Bill Would Have Done
When you get no votes from the other side ― meaning the Democrats ― it is a very difficult situation, he said elsewhere.

Wednesday's ruling was criticized by leading reproductive health and civil rights groups.
Matthew Edward, 23, came to CPAC from Illinois. Trump was his third choice for president, after Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. But on Thursday, he roamed the halls in a MAGA hat, perfectly content with how the administration was operating.
COLUMBIA, S.C. ― South Carolina was the site of one of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' most humiliating defeats in his 2016 presidential run. He received just 26 percent of the vote in the Palmetto State's early primary, presaging a shutout in the South that virtually assured Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination.
Congressional Quarterly via Getty Images Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen spoke outside the Supreme Court Tuesday.
A key change in individual taxes could occur with the revision of tax brackets. Trump's proposal calls for reducing tax brackets for individuals from seven to three set at 10, 25, and 35 percent. According to The Wall Street Journal, this reduces the amount of taxes on individual income for those earning over $699,000 by $214,000, while their ultimate share of all federal taxes reduces to 25 percent. This will benefit the wealthy since the top tax rate decreases from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.
Here's McConnell again, from a Reuters interview: If we had the votes to completely start over, we'd do it. But that depends on what happens in a couple weeks.
The reality, of course, is far more complicated. And it was readily apparent at this week's Conservative Political Action Conference. The gathering of students, activists and operatives featured a number of die-hard Trump supporters, including those able to rationalize a principled support of the president, even after such a hypothetical shooting.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken numerous steps to worsen the health insurance market for people with pre-existing conditions.
And, Hogue said, the Supreme Court can also be swayed by public opinion.
In a separate, prerecorded interview that ran Sunday on NBC's Today show, Conway reiterated a promise she and other Republican officials have made repeatedly: That nobody with insurance through Obamacare right now would lose it in the transition to a new system.
Health care policy is all about tradeoffs, so for all these changes, there would be countereffects, including a reduction in taxes on the wealthy that the Affordable Care Act raised to finance its coverage expansions.
Insurers could go back to screening customers for health status, as they did before the health care law took effect, charging higher premiums or denying coverage altogether to people who have histories of cancer, diabetes or even plain old allergies.
Trump, after all, famously promised during his presidential campaign that he wouldn't touch Medicare or Medicaid. Then he won the election. The GOP is hoping that pattern repeats itself this Election Day.
Trump's economic team feels that cutting taxes will help the American economy in order to reach their goal of 4 percent GDP growth. But the plan has some potential problems that outweigh the intended benefits.
Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), meanwhile, said he believes the better approach is relying on more incremental proposals like Medicare at 50, which would allow Americans 50 and older to buy into the Medicare program, to expand the health insurance market.
The battle could play a key role in determining control of the Senate in 2020. McSally, for instance, is facing a stiff Democratic challenge from former astronaut Mark Kelly, who is married to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Democrats need to pick up at least three seats to gain control of Congress' upper chamber and have any hope of enacting the party's agenda.
Although the success of this approach has yet to manifest itself in the polls, Harris, in particular, has provided Sanders ample fodder to distinguish himself as a more genuine champion of single-payer health care.
States have always had some flexibility to request these sorts of waivers, of course. But when the Obama administration was in charge, it set clear limits on state action. To get waiver approval, states had to demonstrate that residents wouldn't end up with worse coverage as a result.
The regulation about short-term plans isn't in place yet, but a prior regulation opened the door to more association health plans that allow businesses to band together to offer health coverage to workers but that don't have to follow all of the Affordable Care Act's rules, including those guaranteeing a basic set of covered benefits.

The closest thing to what Palin was describing was a proposed commission on Medicare spending. But it was hardly a death panel. Its job was to make broad changes in how the program paid for medical services, not sit in judgment of individual patients or their merits.
Back in March, this epidemiological reality prompted Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas and a prominent Trump supporter, to suggest that risking the health of people in his generation (he just turned 70) was a worthwhile price for allowing businesses to return to operating normally.
Medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, Indian Health Service reforms, the Medicaid expansion, FDA authority over generic biologics — all would fall by the wayside, Jost said.
Just last week, a report from the Congressional Budget Office predicted that removing the individual mandate but keeping other Obamacare provisions, such as the pre-existing condition guarantee, would lead to premiums jumping by 20 to 25 percent within a year, above and beyond current projections.
This guidance suggests the federal government will allow states to target assistance differently, as Verma confirmed Monday, which could mean giving people more assistance if they buy short-term or other alternative plans ― and less assistance if they stick with comprehensive coverage.
In fact, some of his supposed accomplishments further give the lie to his claim that he supports protections for preexisting conditions. The Trump administration has expanded access to several kinds of health insurance that aren't available to people with preexisting conditions, like short-term health plans.
It's also not a substitute for the hundreds of billions of dollars that the Affordable Care Act spends every year on private insurance subsidies and expanded Medicaid ― which, in turn, has improved financial security, access to care and health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders.
As HuffPost has noted, though, it's a whole lot harder for Trump to paint himself as the solution to crime and civil unrest-fueled-rioting when those problems have exploded on his watch. He ran in 2016 on a similar platform; now he is asking for a chance to deliver on a promise he couldn't keep.
Even as some Democratic operatives privately concede Republican voters are likely to unite against the bill in the not-so-distant future, they have both messaging and policy reasons to be confident the bill will remain broadly popular.
The reality, of course, is far more complicated. And it was readily apparent at this week's Conservative Political Action Conference. The gathering of students, activists and operatives featured a number of die-hard Trump supporters, including those able to rationalize a principled support of the president, even after such a hypothetical shooting.
Staff for Susan Collins referred HuffPost to previous comments the Maine senator made to Bangor Daily News that she was disappointed in President Donald Trump for not allowing a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act, but did not comment on Congress taking further action on health care specifically.
To accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. In theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from Alexander-Collins.
For a lot of years, the threat against women's health care has been talked about, but they've never been as real as they are today, said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who works on health care. It's changed from a coffee table conversation to a clear and present danger. That means voters can no longer stay with Republicans and assume that this won't become an issue.
Wednesday's decision sent the case back to a lower court. Further attempts to block the Trump rules may soon follow.
There were no criteria and no limits on who could testify, Connelly said.
She also said on Tuesday that she would not raise middle class taxes to pay for the program.
At one point, Trump suggested that Clinton actually preferred to create a single-payer plan ― something that would come as a great shock to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who proposed a single-payer scheme during the Democratic primaries that Clinton attacked repeatedly. (Trump also suggested that single-payer plans are catastrophic in certain ways, even though those systems actually outperform the U.S. system by at least some metrics, while managing to provide truly universal coverage with significantly lower spending.)
I traveled to 48 states in this country. I have traveled to many, many African American communities and I have talked to a whole lot of people, he said. And I hope my views change in response to what I have learned.
The campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Obamacare's Problems And Two Visions For Fixing Them
In comparison to the 2009 law, which contained a relatively paltry $25 boost to weekly unemployment checks, the COVID-19 relief bill offers a $300-a-week boost, along with $1,400 checks for most Americans and an expanded child tax credit that should regularly funnel money to poor and working class families soon.
Many wondered why Ivanka and Jared were there. While some questioned whether they were even invited, New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers cleared that up, reporting Saturday that McCain's friend Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Ivanka to attend.
Joel McElvain, outgoing assistant director of the federal programs branch, has spent more than 20 years at the department, much of it working on the biggest cases of the day. A former colleague described McElvain to HuffPost as a really good guy — the type who in any rational or just world would be at DOJ his entire career.
Betsy McCaughey built a career out of saying bombastic, completely false things about health care reform. She is reviled by actual health care policy analysts from the left, right and center for spreading frightening, but demonstrably false, misinformation while adopting the tone and posture of a serious expert.
Before the Affordable Care Act, it already was illegal for health insurance companies to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them more based on their medical histories if they got coverage through a group plan, like from an employer. And insurers and employers are limited in how much they could refuse to pay for treatments related to a pre-existing condition for group policyholders. The Affordable Care Act extended similar protections to people who buy their health insurance directly or via the exchanges the law created.
I'll be curious to see how the lawyers try to square Trump signing this executive order while simultaneously arguing before the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act's protections for pre-existing conditions be annihilated. — Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) August 8, 2020
In Houston, at the Epiphany Community Health Outreach Services, a local nonprofit that works with the immigrant community, SNAP enrollment dropped by a third compared with this time last year. Meanwhile, participation in the food pantry program increased 266 percent, according to the center.
Here's McConnell again, from a Reuters interview: If we had the votes to completely start over, we'd do it. But that depends on what happens in a couple weeks.
On Tuesday, the Late Show host hammered Ryan for declaring how a Congressional Budget Office report estimating up to 24 million people could lose cover under the GOP's proposed replacement for Obamacare exceeded my expectations.
In some states, cuts would happen automatically because the executive actions or laws authorizing expansion call for restoring the pre-expansion eligibility standards if the extra federal funds stop flowing.
Here's what she said about Obamacare in 2009:
This decision reflects CMS' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated exchanges to their most cost-effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process, Verma said.
The term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what Trump is perpetrating. His claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
Not every 2020 Democrat is in the same place on abortion. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands out for, for years, supporting the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits spending federal money (such as Medicaid) on abortion services. And after the Alabama law passed, he notably tweeted a statement that was noticeably less fiery and outraged than what the other candidates were putting out. But he too seems to be feeling the energy: In early May, he said he no longer supports Hyde.
Right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving Iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash.
That's significant, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based out of Washington.
During the debate, Clinton made the same argument she's made so many times before ― that the pluses of Obamacare far outweigh the minuses, so the best next step is to fix the law's shortcomings. And although she ran out of time to describe these steps in detail, she has said previously she would focus on reducing the cost of prescription drugs and providing more financial assistance to people with particularly onerous premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
Statements like these are just rhetoric. But they are consistent with a long-standing approach to policy ― promoted by conservatives, implemented by Republicans ― in which protecting the elderly and the frail has been a secondary priority, at best.
While it seems that every candidate — including President Trump — is vowing these days to protect people with preexisting conditions, you can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true, Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote recently.
Normally, the U.S. Department of Justice defends federal laws from challenges like this. Not this time. Instead, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is asking a federal judge to leave most of the law in place, except for the parts about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. No, really.
The concept was notional until April 2006, when a state-level reform fitting those criteria became law in Massachusetts, with the signature of a Republican governor (Mitt Romney) and support of some conservative intellectuals (at the Heritage Foundation). It was proof of concept for the Democrats ― including Obama, who, while putting together his campaign health plan, was already thinking about what might get GOP votes.
Finally, Trump said at a White House Unleashing American Energy event that he planned to cancel Obama-era limits on U.S. financing for overseas coal projects and that he would accelerate efforts to effectively turn American communities into energy colonies mined for fossil fuels to export overseas. We have nearly 100 years' worth of natural gas and more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal, Trump said. We will be dominant. We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe. Trump is selling the idea of clean coal at a time when even litigious coal baron and Trump booster Bob Murray admits that the process of trying to make clean coal through the process of carbon capture and sequestration does not work.
Furthermore, some of the Republicans involved in this pre-existing conditions mess are particularly vulnerable.
The high cost of insurance, even with the Affordable Care Act in place, has been a major source of discontent with the law, especially among people in relatively good health who were able to purchase insurance previously ― and who had to pay more after the law took effect, because insurers for the first time were covering bills from people with severe medical needs.
After Iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser Michael Flynn went before the White House press corps to deliver a bellicose response. But just hours later, top National Security Council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that Iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the United States would continue to comply as well.
There's no need to speculate about how insurance companies would respond to this, because this is how the system worked for people who bought individual policies before the Affordable Care Act. Insurers don't make money paying claims; they make money by avoiding claims or refusing the pay them. If they're allowed to keep the most expensive people and treatments off their books, they will.

You can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass. And that can't be how any democracy functions over time.
Cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. Day one, I will rip to shreds the Iran deal, he repeated at a North Carolina rally on March 7, 2016.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the cut late Tuesday. The cut will affect navigators, the nonprofit organizations that the federal government pays to help with enrollment in the states that use HealthCare.gov as their online marketplace for people trying to get coverage through the Affordable Care Act.
Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Demonstrators at the Supreme Court in 2015, which is the last time a lawsuit threatening the Affordable Care Act got a hearing before the justices.
Democrats had just passed a law spending unprecedented amounts of government money to help Americans going through an equally unprecedented crisis. Republicans almostly unanimously opposed the legislation, but opinion surveys showed a strong majority of the public had favorable views of the plan.
There's no evidence that Trump cares about health care at all beyond his intense desire to undo anything President Barack Obama did in office. Has there been anything about Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic to suggest that the health and well-being of Americans is a priority for him? Two hundred thousand dead say otherwise.
Ending the filibuster wasn't on the political agenda in the way it is now. And Democratic leaders rejected the idea of using the budget reconciliation process, where they wouldn't have to worry about the filibuster, in part because they thought its complex parliamentary rules would prohibit essential parts of the proposal, turning legislation into Swiss cheese.
Congress could always render the lawsuit moot by approving a one-sentence law eliminating the language of the mandate, for example. So far, nobody has seriously tried to pass such a measure.
Obamacare got some serious attention in Sunday's town hall debate, following an audience question about why insurance seemed to be getting more and more expensive, while covering less and less.
The Washington Post via Getty Images Seema Verma, the Trump administration official who oversees federal health programs, says Monday's rule change will give states more flexibility. The question is how much flexibility, whether it's consistent with the law and ultimately how it would affect consumers.
With so many more patients covered, hospital margins grew and days of cash-on-hand climbed. Such financial improvements enabled the hospital to invest in new projects, including the Pena Family Health Center in southwest Denver. The hospital planned to construct three more clinics, to expand two existing clinics, and to build a new parking garage to drive new revenues and expand its coverage.
Hard Things Are Hard; Better Is Good
Last month, consumer and patient advocates launched a lawsuit of their own, arguing that some of the Trump administration's rule changes violate the Affordable Care Act's coverage guarantees. It's not clear whether the changes the administration announced Monday will provoke similar lawsuits, or how vulnerable the rule change could be.
The original impetus for guaranteeing CSR payments was to avoid disruption, since insurers had been counting upon those payments and Trump was loudly threatening to stop them (as he eventually did). Last fall, Alexander, who is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, worked closely with his Democratic counterpart, ranking minority member Patty Murray of Washington state, on a bill that would have funded CSRs. It was a rare show of genuine bipartisanship.
The bill would have ended Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and cut funding for the rest of the Medicaid program going forward. It would have scaled back regulations on what insurance covers. It also would have redistributed financial assistance, so that people with lower incomes and higher insurance costs would get less than they do today ― even as more affluent people would qualify for substantial new subsidies.
Whether Obama could have pushed conservative Democrats harder, or picked different places to give ground, remains a source of disagreement between him and some of his liberal allies even today. What's not in dispute is that Obama always realized the law would need more work. That's why he talked about it as a starter home, with the expectation that it would be possible to bolster and expand the program over time, through a series of legislative and administrative fixes.
The trouble is that those changes also made coverage more expensive, since insurers are now covering people and services they used to avoid. And although millions benefit from tax credits that offset these higher prices, millions do not. They face prices much higher than they expected or feel they should pay ― and one side effect is that many of these people are electing to go without coverage, upsetting the delicate actuarial balance insurers need to cover their costs.
Single-payer advocates also pointed out that the Rules Committee worked with Jayapal and Sanders, and these advocates also believe the final witnesses aren't bad. They just wish there were someone who would more forcefully make the case for Medicare for All.
Congress could always render the lawsuit moot by approving a one-sentence law eliminating the language of the mandate, for example. So far, nobody has seriously tried to pass such a measure.
Under the Alexander-Collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or CSR funds could pay for abortion services. If that were to become law, then it's almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.
And in that WZZM interview, James dodged questions for a full 10 minutes while correspondent Nick LaFave repeatedly (and admirably) tried to get him to offer something, anything, resembling a specific proposal. The most James would say is that he thought more transparency about hospital prices would bring down prices through competition and that I believe the decision-making should go to the people, not the federal government.
The legal theory of the plaintiffs includes a series of arguments that scholars from across the political spectrum have criticized and, occasionally, mocked. How can there be a command to get insurance when the consequence for disobeying it is literally nothing? Do the people bringing the lawsuit even have standing to sue?
The battle over the soon-to-be law, however, could determine the political future for both parties. Democrats are all but certain to lose ground in Congress in a 2022 midterm, but limiting those losses could give Biden additional opportunities to push progressive policies. Republicans, meanwhile, need to pin down an anti-Biden message and see if fiscal conservatism resonates with their base and the broader electorate the same way it did a decade ago.
Lord Grantham finally collapsed after endless build-up, but sadly didn't die. Everyone on that show looks so very good in black.
The year was 2009, and things did not end well for the Democratic Party. The stimulus legislation grew steadily less popular over time as job growth sputtered. The midterm election a year later would wipe out their massive House majority, and usher in a wave of austerity that further hampered the country's economic comeback.
Republicans are even inventing Washington Post fact-check articles that supposedly called their Democratic opponents liars for saying Republicans are lying about pre-existing conditions. Some GOP senators went so far as to introduce fake legislation about pre-existing conditions. It's a lot of lying.
The outcome of the fight won't be determined solely by messaging: American families will determine if the $1,400 checks and expanded child tax credit included in the plan will help them or not; the schools Biden is promising will soon open will either begin allowing students to return or keep their doors shut; the inflation Republicans predict will either arrive or it won't.
OLIVIER DOULIERY/Getty Images Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has a long record of moderate positions on crime, including his current opposition to police funding cuts, that Trump wants Americans to forget.
Some polling shows younger Black voters have been more receptive to the policy message from candidates. A Washington Post/Ipsos poll in early January showed Biden polling at 48% with Black voters and Sanders second with 20% support, driven primarily by supporters under the age of 35. But even that poses its own electoral hurdle; in 2008, a year known for its focus on young voters, voters under the age of 29 made up just 14% of the electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary.
President Donald Trump was famously not invited to the memorial service of Sen. John McCain, which took place Saturday at the National Cathedral in Washington. The president's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner were in attendance, however.
Mary actually took her own necklace off and tossed it onto her bed! Insouciantly. It clattered.
The goal of the advertising is to remind liberal-leaning young people that one of the two old men vying for the presidency agrees with them on the issues a lot more than the other does. One of NextGen's first ads is design to rebut the idea that there is little difference between Biden and Trump, comparing and contrasting Biden's pledge to expand health care coverage with Trump's support for repealing Obamacare; and Biden's support for clean energy with Trump's backing of unchecked pollution, among other issues.
An Effect That The Numbers Don't Reveal
And if Trump was woefully ill-informed about the Iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, they tracked congressional Republicans' attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the GOP nomination, which were then further escalated by Fox News hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.

So far, he has been given a fair amount of leeway.
Republican congressional leaders have essentially given up on repealing Obamacare ― at least in this Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear earlier this year that he has no intention of leading his conference into another fight over the law, despite Trump's vow to turn the GOP into the party of health care. The Kentucky Republican is instead focusing on retaining his majority next year by hammering Democrats over Medicare for All, a government-run health care proposal he says will put the country on a dangerous path to socialism.
But ― as HuffPost's Jeffrey Young pointed out on Sunday ― most people facing increases will be able to switch to cheaper plans, and of course millions will get tax credits that amount to huge discounts. That's little consolation to the millions who don't get big tax credits, but, as a recent analysis from the Urban Institute pointed out, on average the plans the law makes available are not more expensive than the ones employers provide employees. If anything, they are a little cheaper.
Meanwhile, progressives in Congress either don't see how they're getting snowed ― or are unwilling to say it.
We want to know what will happen with the Medicaid expansion population, and what will be the timeline for that, said Peg Burnette, Denver Health's chief financial officer. Due to theuncertainty, we're not going to issue new debt. We have no plans for that in the near future.
So, again, his plan is to not have a plan. If he had one, he would tell us.
More recently, some prominent Republicans have seemed less than concerned about the plight of another vulnerable group in this crisis: workers at meatpacking plants. They, too, would be suffering less with more testing, protective gear, attention to their working conditions and leeway to stay home if they are at higher risk.
Biden does not support defunding the police. Biden has actually proposed increased federal funding for police departments to hire additional officers, while Trump has proposed cutting federal funds for local departments in each of the budgets of his presidency.
We didn't adequately explain what we had done, Biden said during a conversation with House Democrats last week, reflecting on the passage of the 2009 law. Barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a 'victory lap.' I kept saying, 'Tell people what we did.' He said, 'We don't have time. I'm not going to take a victory lap.' And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.
Advocates for choice argued that public pressure can still make a difference. There are elected officials at the state level, and activists want to see Congress take steps to protect reproductive rights. Many people also felt encouraged that every major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate supports abortion, and some are even offering proactive measures to strengthen those rights.
Of those four witnesses, perhaps only Nahvi is actually an advocate for Medicare for All, the single-payer health care system that would transition everyone to Medicare. And even then, sources tell HuffPost that Nahvi's testimony is supposed to be limited to how patient experience would change. That means that when the Rules Committee convenes this hearing on Tuesday, there may not be any witness testifying who will make the case for Medicare for All over other health care plans.
At the same time, the White House largely moved on to other things after passing the stimulus legislation. The conversation in Congress turned to the health care reform effort that would eventually become Obamacare. And while economists broadly came to realize that even the then-unprecedented $787 billion stimulus law wasn't enough to jump-start the economy, unified Republican opposition and defections from conservative Democrats prevented the White House from passing a second piece of legislation aimed at creating jobs.
Let's get this out of the way first: Democrats don't have to do anything to protect people with pre-existing conditions because they already did. That law is called the Affordable Care Act, it includes an ironclad guarantee that no one can be turned down for health insurance regardless of their medical histories, and then-President Barack Obama signed it on March 23, 2010.
Right now in the middle of a public health crisis and an economic crisis, not knowing whether you're going to have that important health coverage when you go to pick up your prescription is really terrifying, she said. This isn't what the intent of the Affordable Care Act was.
More recently, some COVID-19 relief measures have extended or built upon part of the Affordable Care Act ― which is yet more proof, as University of Connecticut professor John Cogan has argued, that Congress understood the law would stay in place and supports that.
An answer Barrett gave at her confirmation hearing, when the issue of the Affordable Care Act came up repeatedly, suggests that she too has a traditional view on severability.
Trump's promise to rip up the Iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.
You sound like the most optimistic guy in the Donner Party, said Colbert, referencing the pioneers who reportedly resorted to cannibalism after they were stranded in the Sierra Nevada in the winter of 1846/47.
Among the many political realities of 2009 frequently forgotten today are that Democrats had only 58 Senate seats for the first few months, because of litigation over Minnesota's close Senate race (eventually Democrat Al Franken won the seat) and because Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was still a Republican (eventually he switched parties).
It's a ridiculous question, Farage said, in between drags from his cigarette. It's a ludicrous question. I don't know. ... What you've seen in the first few days is his full intention to carry out his campaign promises. How refreshing.
I strongly doubt [Trump] understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement. Richard Nephew, former State Department official
Election Day is 40 days away, and Trump knows he's on the wrong side of public opinion on health care. He's going to keep repeating falsehoods and misrepresentations about his health care record and agenda. But the totality of his actions as president makes very clear that his promises of better, cheaper health care are extremely hard to believe.
Trump's new solution? An executive order that directs the Department of Health and Human Services to start coming up with some kind of plan next year if Congress doesn't pass a bill by Jan. 1, 2021. He will instruct me to investigate executive actions and regulatory actions that we can take that will ensure that patients are nonetheless protected against surprise medical bills, is how Azar described it.
Just 31 percent of Americans approve of the new Alabama anti-abortion law, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. A quarter of Americans who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases disapprove of the law, as do about a third of Republicans, self-described evangelical Christians and self-described conservatives.
Democrats have noticed what the Trump administration is doing and are hoping voters do, too. Nationally, Democratic candidates have made rising health care costs a central plank in their platform during this year's midterm elections, and Tuesday's announcement provides them more fodder for their case that the GOP is mishandling the health care system.
Barrow discovered a weakness in Jug-ears and didn't do a happy dance but offered to teach him how to read. We all know where that can lead, don't we? First there's teaching, then there's reading, then there's skimming, then that day we read no further (look it up).
Corporations stand to gain substantially since their tax rate would decrease from 35 to 15 percent. This is considered the most aggressive step in the Trump tax plan since the goal is to set the corporate tax rate on par or below that of other industrialized countries and, therefore, become more competitive. The objectives are to bring jobs to American shores, attract foreign capital, and incentivize global companies to establish subsidiaries or relocate to the United States while stimulating long-term economic growth.
Those changes are one reason the number of Americans without health insurance is so much lower than it was before the Affordable Care Act became law.
This is word salad worthy of Sarah Palin. Even the comprehensible parts don't make sense. Allowing insurance sales across state lines, for example, won't enable people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance. If anything, it will have the opposite effect, since some states have historically forced insurers to sell to all comers ― and allowing cross-state purchasing would render those regulations moot. Republican schemes to block grant Medicaid typically involve reducing the program's funding, which would, according to impartial estimates, vastly reduce the number of people who could get insurance.
Since enrollment started in 2014, the Affordable Care Act brought significant changes to Denver Health Medical Center, a safety-net hospital with the busiest trauma center in Colorado. Historically, nearly two-thirds of patients were either uninsured or covered by Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.
And for all of their bluster, Trump and his advisers might be worried about the consequences of weakening the mandate.
One Sentence Could Make The Case Go Away
We can't even pay for Medicare for some. We need to solidify that. We need to fix the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Tuesday when asked about Medicare for All.
At least that's what the senators say it will do. Here's the thing, though: That's bogus.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has rejected donations from top pharmaceutical company executives and corporate board chairs since 2017, though his campaign did not immediately say whether he would do the same for health insurance companies.
Republicans are reminding America that they are in the minority on most of these important issues. Sometimes all of us have unpopular positions, that they've taken it to such an extreme that it puts an exclamation point on just how far removed they are from the majority of the American people, Buttigieg told HuffPost.
Our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare is the surest sign that we need someone who will go and work their tail off to remove this monstrosity, James says in the clip, which he recorded while he was seeking the GOP nomination to run against Michigan's other Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow. It was a key issue in his campaign; in an October 2018 debate, James said we took a system that was broken and made it worse.
And Congress this year repealed the tax penalties associated with the individual mandate that most people obtain health coverage, effectively ending the mandate and removing a key incentive for less-expensive healthy consumers to pay into the insurance system. That will cause premiums to rise for those who remain in the exchange market.
The roads around Bethlehem Baptist Church are lined with signs promoting Obamacare. The gas station around the corner from the church is named Obama Gas, its sign emblazoned with a portrait of the 44th president.
If a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don't buy him a knife, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Feb. 10, 2016 town hall. This Iran deal is the worst deal.
It's an adorable little bill but does not address any of the main issues, Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute, told Kaiser Health News. You need a package of policies working together in order to create real protections for people to have coverage to meet their health care needs.
And all of them, they say, are afraid.
The direct aid, along with additional funding to reopen schools and speed up vaccine distribution, is meant to quickly help Americans regardless of their employment status, while the stimulus's extensive funding for state governments and spending on infrastructure projects was explicitly intended to create jobs.
Instead of blaming President Obama and the Democrats or thinking that misplaced risks and inaccurate enrollment predictions are the problem, maybe some of those CEOs earning $10-$15 million dollars per year should stop whining about not making enough profits and start finding ways to help fellow human beings survive and thrive... maybe even human beings who aren't white.
Although the details of the argument evolved over time, the gist was always the same: Obamacare would ration treatments for society's most vulnerable members, like the disabled and the elderly, because their lives wouldn't be deemed worth the expense of saving.
This new, have-it-every-which-way approach pushes the extremely challenging implementation of the Medicare for All part of this plan ten years into the future, meaning it would not occur on the watch of even a two-term administration, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. The result? A Bernie Sanders-lite Medicare for All and a refusal to be straight with the American middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.
As South Carolina's Feb. 29 Democratic primary approaches ― the nomination race's fourth contest in a state where Black voters make up the majority of the party's base ― Biden's lead in polls has not wavered. It's the state that was hailed as having solidified Obama's path to the nomination in 2008, and this year's primary comes just days before Super Tuesday, when voters in many of the big states — including Texas and California — go to the ballot box.
The basis for the lawsuit is the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. As originally written, the health care law imposed a financial penalty on people who could get insurance but did not.
Obama's focus on Republican opposition and its effects may sound self-serving to some people ― whether it's conservatives who blame Obama for polarizing the country, or progressives who think Obama is trying to avoid blame for compromises he should never have made. Reasonable people can certainly question individual decisions that Obama, along with other Democratic leaders, made at various points in the Affordable Care Act's history.
The Affordable Care Act protects people with preexisting conditions, mostly by prohibiting insurers from denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. It also requires that all plans cover 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs.
Trump has made abortion and, more broadly, women's health care and women's rights, to be an issue in 2020, Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen told HuffPost. He was the one who, during the State of the Union, lied, deliberately spreading misinformation about abortion care and women's health care. He's the one who has made this a campaign issue. And we say: Bring it on.
[T]his Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets, she wrote, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Faced with high out-of-pocket costs, many women will forgo contraception … or resort to less effective contraceptive methods.
As with past weeks, presiding over Pruitt's assault on the environment, the GOP Congress's assault on health care, Devos's assault on students, and other policy outrages hasn't been enough for Donald J. Trump, who must always deliver his own personal brand of kleptocratic, misogynistic, narcissistic, and Putinistic disgracefulness.
Corlette noted that the Obama administration insisted that state waivers not hurt certain vulnerable populations, including those with severe medical needs. This is saying that so long as things work out in the aggregate, then it's OK if certain subpopulations are harmed, she said.
Heller, for example, is facing a major challenge to his re-election in large part because of his flip-flopping on Affordable Care Act repeal and eventual support for the last version of the legislation to replace it. That bill was the brainchild of Cassidy and Graham and absolutely would have weakened pre-existing condition protections.
In Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday, Trump signed executive orders he claims address two of the biggest concerns Americans have about the health care system: coverage for people with preexisting conditions and surprise medical bills.
So that's where all the lying comes from. Fortunately, the truth is easy to find. If the GOP survives what's shaping up to be a brutal election year and retains control of Congress, rest assured they will again come for health care. They always try.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and many Republicans have pushed back against the need for additional stimulus during the pandemic, saying they see no urgency in passing a fifth relief package. But among the ideas Republicans have put forward, like expanding the PPP program, implementing tax credits for hiring workers or bonuses for rehired workers, health care has largely been left out of the emergency relief debate.
Declining government spending would reduce the federal deficit, the CBO predicted in that report, and average premiums for people buying coverage on their own would end up lower than they would have been otherwise. But those lower premiums would be a byproduct of older and sicker people dropping insurance altogether ― because insurers would have made it too pricey for them, and because the plans available on the market would have tended to cover much less.
At the moment, a federal judge in Texas is considering a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act that GOP officials in 20 states launched. The Trump administration, rather than defending the federal law as administrations normally do in such circumstances, filed a brief in support of the plaintiff's claim about the law's constitutionality.
Back in March, this epidemiological reality prompted Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas and a prominent Trump supporter, to suggest that risking the health of people in his generation (he just turned 70) was a worthwhile price for allowing businesses to return to operating normally.
So far, the campaign is playing out a lot like it did in 2018, with Republicans insisting, again, that they would never take away protections for people with preexisting conditions. Several are running ads featuring family members who fought medical problems, just to prove how serious they are.
And not all Americans will qualify for Medicaid, the public health program for low-income Americans.
Ever since it passed in 2010, Republicans promised to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. When Donald Trump won the White House and Republicans won control of both chambers of Congress in 2016, they finally had their chance. Voters, however, started to realize what would be lost if the law were repealed, and Obamacare suddenly became significantly more popular. Activists mobilized to protest vulnerable GOP lawmakers who had supported repeal, and health care was a top issue energizing Democratic voters.
You get the program started, you figure out what the kinks are, what works, what doesn't. You amend, build, improve, refine ― that kind of iterative process, where you've set a goal and gotten the foundations laid, and then Congress in a cooperative fashion works to keep making it better. That process, which is very beneficial because you're getting real data and feedback about what's working and what's not ― that's less available to you now. The process that built Social Security, built Medicaid, Medicare, that only works if you got both parties working in good faith.
Overall, however, the mood was notably more subdued than past gatherings. After eight years out of power in the White House, attendees seemed thrilled to have finally reached the mountaintop. But, as even the organizers conceded, they still didn't know what to make of the sherpa.
The incumbent in Michigan isn't a Republican, however. It's Democrat Gary Peters, a well-liked but not especially well-known former investment adviser who has spent nearly 30 years in politics ― as a city councilor, state senator, lottery commissioner and then a U.S. House member before succeeding Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in 2015.
Spratt truly sounded as if he was about to swallow his own lips when Denker turned the tables on him. Wouldn't that be amazing--if he got fired, he could join a circus!
Maybe market forces - ie. profitability - are incompatible or inapplicable when saving people's lives? Unless, of course, you believe that only rich people's lives are worth saving because their wealth is merely a sign that god truly loves them (c.f. Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism).
An estimated 4 million Hispanics aged 18-64 gained coverage, and the share without insurance fell from 41.8 percent to 30.5 percent. Among working-age African-American adults, the uninsured rate declined from 22.4 percent to 10.6 percent as 3 million got covered. And the proportion of non-Hispanic whites without coverage went down from 14.3 percent to 7 percent as a result of 8.9 million adults between 18 and 64 becoming insured.
Trump barely engaged in the 2017 legislative fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a GOP plan that would have kicked tens of millions of Americans off their health care. After that failed, he gave up even trying to legislate on health care, and instead, his administration turned its focus to sabotaging the ACA's health insurance marketplaces, imposing onerous new requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, promoting the sale of junk health insurance policies that, unlike ACA plans, do exclude people with preexisting conditions, and getting the courts to kill the ACA for him.
The savings from this new cut account for less than half a percent of what the federal government is expected to spend to subsidized private coverage and Medicaid next year.
The American Health Care Act ― the ACA repeal-and-replace bill that the House passed and that Trump threw a party for in the White House Rose Garden ― specifically was designed to make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get and keep their health insurance. In fact, the measure wouldn't have made it through the House if GOP leaders hadn't made it more hostile to people with pre-existing conditions as a means to attract more conservative votes. This bill would have meant 23 million more uninsured people by 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The failed Senate Obamacare repeal bill authored by GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) was the same.
What The GOP Bill Would Have Done
Campaign ads attacking President Donald Trump's administration for trying to sabotage Obamacare are already popping up in congressional races.
Lev Raphael is the author of The Edith Wharton Murders and 24 other books of fiction and nonfiction.
Democrats are hopeful the Trump administration's lawsuit, which a federal appeals court is expected to hear sometime in July, keeps health care front and center in the minds of voters. Depending on court rulings and timing, the Supreme Court could rule on the lawsuit in the summer of 2020, not long before voters head to the polls. Democrats also note top Republicans have said the party will make another attempt to repeal Obamacare, given the chance.
I was never really a repeal-and-replace guy. I wanted to fix things, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted to repeal Obamacare in 2017, told HuffPost. Like other Republicans, Perdue views Obamacare as fundamentally broken, calling it a disaster. But he, too, talked up the need to maintain some of its core elements.
At the moment, a federal judge in Texas is considering a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act that GOP officials in 20 states launched. The Trump administration, rather than defending the federal law as administrations normally do in such circumstances, filed a brief in support of the plaintiff's claim about the law's constitutionality.
CPAC has never been ideal turf for Trump. Though the gathering helped legitimize him among conservatives when he first appeared in 2011, he skipped the conference in 2016, out of fear that the crowd would walk out of his speech in protest. His address on Friday sparked no such act of defiance. It was, instead, a fairly well received, if not meandering, attack on the press, and a review of campaign promises.
Even the likely targets of bipartisan outreach said that during the course of the entire process they never heard from Trump. A spokesman for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said a call never came.
To put an extra head spin on the whole incident, Trump's Department of Justice argued before the Supreme Court in June to shut down the ACA with its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. It even specifically singled out coverage for preexisting conditions as something that's got to go.
More conservative members, led by the House Freedom Caucus, were angry that the bill left some of the Affordable Care Act's insurance regulations in place. Those regulations, they suggested, would keep premiums from falling further ― although the precise relationship between each of these regulations and actual premiums is murky.
They could change their minds of course. And the pressure to enact these policies could build, thanks to a progressive movement that is already louder and more organized around goals than it was during Obama's presidency. But even if Democrats succeed at reducing structural barriers to change, and even if a progressive movement succeeds in demanding more action, legislation is likely to be full of compromises and fall short of Democrats' loftiest goals, just like the Affordable Care Act did.
Republicans are reminding America that they are in the minority on most of these important issues. Sometimes all of us have unpopular positions, that they've taken it to such an extreme that it puts an exclamation point on just how far removed they are from the majority of the American people, Buttigieg told HuffPost.
Getty Images Chief Justice John Roberts (right) has twice joined more liberal justices to save the Affordable Care Act. But now he would need at least one more conservative to join him, putting the focus on newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett (right).
Speculation in November and early December, captured in national headlines, questioned the strength of Biden's frontrunner status in South Carolina, but the most recent survey showed him with a comfortable lead. The Fox News poll conducted in early January showed him 21 percentage points ahead of runners-up billionaire Tom Steyer, who has been investing heavily in the South Carolina primary. Close behind Steyer were Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Still, Biden's ability to cite the first Black president as his close personal friend poses perhaps the biggest challenge to the other candidates in South Carolina. To make inroads in the state, Biden's competitors have to effectively pull the former vice president away from Obama. On paper, it's not difficult to make that point by noting Biden's long record in government — one that was far more conservative than Obama's on issues like criminal justice reform, health care and national security.
Worse still, his South Carolina defeat epitomized the difficulty he had attracting support from black voters, a core constituency for the Democratic Party.
Biden's campaign ― which has been holding out hope that a big win in South Carolina would give the former vice president the momentum he needs to win in states across the country ― has said from the beginning that it's important to restore the soul of the nation against Donald Trump's administration. On Saturday, Biden rephrased: His campaign also wants this election to be about the soul of the Democratic Party.
Making sure people who have pre-existing health conditions don't get screwed by health insurance companies is very popular. So popular that a bunch of Republican senators who are freaked out about the party's electoral prospects have introduced legislation to guarantee that no Americans may be denied coverage because of their medical history.
For the last two years, Republicans promised to protect preexisting conditions while trying to gut them. For the next two years, they may pretend to abandon health care repeal, but they're doing everything they can to repeal, sabotage and overturn it, said Jesse Ferguson, a top Democratic strategist. If they were serious about stopping health care repeal, they would be doing something to stop Trump's Department of Justice from trying to strike down the entire law.
Sponsors of private employer plans, through which roughly half of all Americans get insurance, could once again impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, since it's the Affordable Care Act that made such limits illegal. That could really hammer patients with rare forms of cancer or congenital conditions, such as hemophilia, for which treatments can easily exceed $1 million per year or sometimes even per month.
The Democrats today have one advantage, though. They can learn from the past. And when I asked Obama to reflect on what he and the Affordable Care Act's architects got wrong, he cited a failure to grasp the depth and duration of GOP opposition. I think what we got wrong was underestimating the degree to which political polarization had ― the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled, the former president said, adding later, I think any progressive president, on any issue for the next several years, is going to have to confront the problem that the GOP has shifted into a perpetual campaign mode.
The regulation about short-term plans isn't in place yet, but a prior regulation opened the door to more association health plans that allow businesses to band together to offer health coverage to workers but that don't have to follow all of the Affordable Care Act's rules, including those guaranteeing a basic set of covered benefits.
The American Health Care Act ― the ACA repeal-and-replace bill that the House passed and that Trump threw a party for in the White House Rose Garden ― specifically was designed to make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get and keep their health insurance. In fact, the measure wouldn't have made it through the House if GOP leaders hadn't made it more hostile to people with pre-existing conditions as a means to attract more conservative votes.

[T]his Court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets, she wrote, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Faced with high out-of-pocket costs, many women will forgo contraception … or resort to less effective contraceptive methods.
It was a starter home. It's been vandalized. And people at times tried to undermine its foundations. But it's held up.
The American Health Care Act would have cut Medicaid's budget by $834 billion, causing 14 million people to lose coverage. The Cassidy-Graham bill also sought to slash Medicaid. Those bills didn't become law, but not for want of Republicans trying. The Senate measure failed by a single vote (given that Vice President Mike Pence would've cast a tie-breaking vote in the event of a 50-50 tally).
In fact, as Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times pointed out on Tuesday, eliminating coverage requirements for the pre-existing conditions could have all sorts of far-reaching effects, making it difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for the federal government to distribute tax credits that today help millions afford coverage.
The quote was relayed to HuffPost numerous times in the course of reporting this story and has clearly made its way to the single-payer groups. Pelosi's spokesman declined to comment on the Primus quote.
Sanders, who sermonizes about U.S. politics in stark moral terms, remains most comfortable expounding on economic policy. It is a tendency that has elicited criticism from some liberals eager to hear him address systemic racial justice and entrenched sexism in more explicit terms.
Some of that is due to polarization, with Obamacare popular among Democratic voters and unpopular among Republicans for reasons that probably have little to do with anything but partisan loyalty. But performance is still an issue. Many millions still can't pay their medical bills, because they don't have insurance or their insurance covers too little. The U.S. still has the world's most confusing and expensive system, with little evidence that the extra money buys better quality.
When asked about the early signs of hospitals putting spending on hold, a White House spokesperson expressed confidence that the disastrous Obamacare law will be replaced with the American Health Care Act — the vehicle which will reform our broken healthcare system.
That's not all. The White House budget request this year called for $250 billion in Medicaid cuts over a decade. The House Republican budget proposal called for reviving the American Health Care Act's Medicaid cuts. And the Trump administration is encouraging states to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees, a policy designed to reduce enrollment in the program. That plan is already working as intended in Arkansas.
If the IRS 'delays' the individual mandate, the insurance markets in many states could go into a tailspin. Rates for 2018 will skyrocket and some insurers could fold, Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan and expert on Obamacare, explained at The Incidental Economist blog.
As Trump navigates his first year in office, his challenge will be keeping these types of voters in the fold as he confronts the tough realities of actual governance. A border wall won't be built quickly, and the repeal of Obamacare may never occur. The question is whether Workman, Edward and many others can forgive a lack of progress as quickly as they forgive Trump's idiosyncratic politics.
Not that the Affordable Care Act's architects thought they were fixing all of the health care system's problems. After nearly a century of failed attempts at passing universal coverage, most recently during Bill Clinton's presidency, Democrats were determined to find a more politically viable path. By around 2006 or so, a consensus had taken shape around a plan that leaned heavily on private insurance and minimized disruption of existing arrangements, and a strategy that stressed negotiating with the health care industry rather than fighting it.
I'm more worried than I have been since it was originally [put in place], said Gail Kaplan-Wassell, a Maryland resident who came to the Supreme Court Tuesday to join a protest in favor of reproductive rights. Kaplan-Wassell said that as a college student in Massachusetts in the 1970s, she had also come to the National Mall to advocate for abortion rights.
In his speech at the church, Biden told a story he would repeat throughout the holiday weekend: that not too long ago a Black man picked him up at the train station in Wilmington, Delaware, and took him to the steps of the Capitol in Washington to be inaugurated as the vice president of the United States. That man, of course, was Barack Obama.
If only there was something, we can call it the AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, and it can have exactly those types of protections and coverages and....oh right @BarackObama did that already.

The new figures HHS published Thursday show the uninsured rate improved across racial and ethnic groups.
The White House, meanwhile, began planning travel. Biden is set to visit Pennsylvania next week to sell the bill, while Vice President Harris will travel to Colorado. Over the next 10 days, the White House plans to highlight different key aspects of the bill, including halving child poverty and boosting rural health care.
The Trump administration is not the first to drop the defense of a federal law. But when past administrations have decided against defending a law, they have generally argued that a case raised highly important moral issues ― or was clearly unconstitutional.
This is what the Obama administration argued in 2011 when it declined to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The decision was controversial, with even some of the administration's own lawyers cautioning that it set a bad precedent.
Trump is right in noting that there was no bipartisan appetite for his health care proposal. And certainly, when you start without any support from the other side of the aisle, it is hard to pass much of anything.
Perhaps most consequentially, the administration has partially sided with a group of Republican state officials seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act on constitutional grounds.
In Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday, Trump signed executive orders he claims address two of the biggest concerns Americans have about the health care system: coverage for people with preexisting conditions and surprise medical bills.

Another possible GOP partner was Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who had worked closely with the top ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, Montana's Max Baucus, on the Medicare drug program under President George W. Bush. They had a close relationship and, at a private meeting of several senators that Baucus convened just after the election in 2008, Grassley said, I haven't heard anything here I don't like … I can't think of an issue that isn't compromise-able, according to the notes one participant took.
The following is adapted from Jonathan Cohn's The Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage, to be published by St. Martin's Press on February 23.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee went even further, essentially accusing Obama of enabling the eventual genocide of Israelis. It is so naive that he would trust the Iranians. By doing so he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven, he said on July 26, 2015.
Trump rattled off a litany of policies his administration has implemented or proposed, ranging from relaxing health insurance regulations to attempting to lower drug prices, few of which have amounted to anything.
It's a great turnout. And it's kind of funny, I was told that there were no progressives in South Carolina, he deadpanned to an approving crowd.
Trump's speech Thursday nicely illustrates the convention's lack of impact. Trump rattled off a long, meandering list of already well-known or politically irrelevant accomplishments and repeated well-worn attacks on Biden. The speech came without any of the gusto that defines his most off-the-rails rally performances but with all of the lies and distortions he typically delivers.
And GOP presidential candidates like Donald Trump continue to call for Obamacare's repeal and replacement with other policies that wouldn't provide coverage to those who gained insurance because of the ACA, and could even result in larger numbers of uninsured than before Obama's reforms took effect.
The closest thing to what Palin was describing was a proposed commission on Medicare spending. But it was hardly a death panel. Its job was to make broad changes in how the program paid for medical services, not sit in judgment of individual patients or their merits.
But it's what the bill doesn't say that makes the above mostly meaningless.
Oral arguments were presented in May via teleconference ― one of the first times in history for the court ― due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was the third time that the birth control mandate reached the Supreme Court, but the first since Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ― appointed by President Donald Trump ― joined the bench.

In theory, even the conservatives justices should make quick work of the case.
WASHINGTON -- Twenty million previously uninsured people have gained health coverage since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, President Barack Obama said during a speech in Milwaukee Thursday.
Our healthcare system is broken and articles with photos like the one above subconsciously perpetuate a myth that black people and minorities are the problem and those poor white CEO's earning $10-$15 million dollars per year are really trying their darnedest to make sure that the healthcare system is fair.
But the effects of invalidation of the ACA would be devastating to our entire health care system, said Timothy Jost, a law professor emeritus at Washington and Lee.
The mandate is among the Affordable Care Act's most controversial features, but experts say it's essential for making the rest of the program work. It's basically a tax on people who decline to get health insurance, even if available coverage meets the law's definition of affordable.
Monday's announcement represents the latest in a series of GOP efforts to accomplish through regulation what Republicans could not accomplish through legislation when they tried, and just barely failed, to pass legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act outright.
Those hardships are real. People who can't pay their bills go hungry, lose their homes and can't pay their medical bills. That is why even public health experts want to come up with smart, careful ways to relax pandemic restrictions.
But when Sanders walked onto the University of South Carolina stage to the adulation of some 1,000 supporters waving Medicare for Y'all placards, it was clear that he had his share of supporters here. Feeding on the crowd's energy, he dispensed with his detractors with a bit of gentle sarcasm.
But conservative Republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. They say the Affordable Care Act violates the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. The Alexander-Collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.
It could be that three years out we are no longer making money, we are losing money, said Himler.
Fun fact: Obamacare, better known as the law, already does that. — Rose Benson (@NotoriousRBF) August 8, 2020
Declines in SNAP and ACA enrollment were largest in mixed status households where some people are in the country legally and some are not, the study found. For example, one family member may be a citizen, another an asylee or a permanent resident, and still another undocumented.
One thing is certain, he said: SNAP is the nation's first line of defense against hunger.
The standard deduction will double, affecting all taxpayers. As the law now stands, single individuals can deduct $6,350 from their taxable income while married couples deduct $12,700. Trump proposes that individuals will deduct $12,700 while married couples can write off $25,400. The proposed benefits are that average taxpayers will pay less taxes if they do not have itemized deductions and simplify tax return preparation without the use of an accountant or preparer.
Everybody is talking about how Democrats need to avoid the traps that ensnared them during former President Barack Obama's first term, when they repeatedly got bogged down in bipartisan negotiations, made all sorts of substantive concessions on policy, and still got virtually no GOP support for their initiatives.
It's up to advocates working with immigrant groups to do all they can to allay the fears of immigrants, Vaughan said, to let them know, no one will be deported for receiving food stamps.
I think the government should pay the doctors instead of putting that money in an insurance company, she said.
But upon closer inspection, the conservative positions then and now have a common theme. It's about whose lives deserve the protection of government programs. And whose don't.
I don't even know what I'd tell a health system if they came to me asking what to do, said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan.
The divisions between the candidates will likely be on display on Tuesday and Wednesday in Detroit for the second presidential debate. Sanders and his fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) take the stage the first night, while Harris and Biden will get a chance to square off against each other on the second night.
That's why both health care plans put forward by Biden and Harris leave some form of a private insurance system largely in place. Sanders, meanwhile, has no qualms about eliminating the private insurance system altogether. He argues that not doing so would leave too many Americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers while driving up costs for everybody.
But ― as HuffPost's Jeffrey Young pointed out on Sunday ― most people facing increases will be able to switch to cheaper plans, and of course millions will get tax credits that amount to huge discounts. That's little consolation to the millions who don't get big tax credits, but, as a recent analysis from the Urban Institute pointed out, on average the plans the law makes available are not more expensive than the ones employers provide employees. If anything, they are a little cheaper.
Trump claimed it's never been done before.
The truth is that, like in so many other areas, Trump doesn't want to do the work. After all, as Trump once said, health care is complicated! Who needs the headache when there are people of color to insult and golf to play?
In South Carolina, Black voters don't need to be pressed hard to say what draws them to Biden. It's Obama.
It was an energetic speech from Biden, who has been dinged on the campaign trail for an apparent inability to spur the same enthusiasm and movement-style politics as Sanders. The senator won the popular vote in Iowa, the New Hampshire primary and had a blowout victory in the Nevada caucuses.
The trouble is that those changes also made coverage more expensive, since insurers are now covering people and services they used to avoid. And although millions benefit from tax credits that offset these higher prices, millions do not. They face prices much higher than they expected or feel they should pay ― and one side effect is that many of these people are electing to go without coverage, upsetting the delicate actuarial balance insurers need to cover their costs.
Take Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley (R), who's trying to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in November. Hawley is one of the plaintiffs in the suit. He's going around simultaneously saying that the lawsuit is good and that McCaskill is lying when she says he's attacking protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who approved his state's participation in the legal action against the ACA, called bringing the suit doing the right thing while posting videos about his deep commitment to people with pre-existing conditions (he's running for re-election). There's a lot of this going around on the campaign trail.
Some of that is due to polarization, with Obamacare popular among Democratic voters and unpopular among Republicans for reasons that probably have little to do with anything but partisan loyalty. But performance is still an issue. Many millions still can't pay their medical bills, because they don't have insurance or their insurance covers too little. The U.S. still has the world's most confusing and expensive system, with little evidence that the extra money buys better quality.
How Trump Plotted To Kill Obamacare
Progressives have balked at the idea, calling it a giveaway to private insurance companies and big corporations that run their own health insurance plans. Subsidizing COBRA would direct federal funds toward private companies that pay higher rates than public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Other health care proposals that have been championed by progressives in both the House and Senate would have Medicare cover Americans' out-of-pocket medical costs during the pandemic, or allow Americans who have filed for unemployment to be eligible for Medicare.
The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the rules, arguing that they would have to cover the cost of birth control for people who lost coverage.
Maybe Winston Churchill can be a future guest and the Dowager Countess will be the one who pushes him to return England to the Gold Standard, which will plunge England into chaos. Talk about tradition!

Palin, who has a child with Down syndrome, went on to say, The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.
The GOP's hope is that by focusing on Medicare for All, they can instead portray Democrats ― even those who don't support the proposal ― as the extremists hoping to blow up the health care system.
And Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, launched the first ads of a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote the Biden-Harris-Democratic agenda. The digital ads, running in the swing states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, contrast the GOP support for the Trump-era tax cuts with the party's unified opposition to the COVID-19 relief bill.
Fewer Protections For People With Pre-existing Conditions
On Tuesday, the Late Show host hammered Ryan for declaring how a Congressional Budget Office report estimating up to 24 million people could lose cover under the GOP's proposed replacement for Obamacare exceeded my expectations.
Overcoming this reality has proven difficult. Hampton offers a perfect example. She works in the health insurance industry, and health care is her biggest priority. Her policy preferences more resemble Sanders and Warren's vision of a government-run health insurance system than Biden's proposal to expand a public option within a private system.
The Individual Mandate And Why It Matters
The implication of leaving millions uninsured is a matter of life and death. A 2019 report on Medicaid expansion found there could have been 15,600 fewer deaths if all 50 states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. There's a growing body of research that has shown expanded public insurance has improved health outcomes, increasing preventative care and saving patients with chronic illnesses, like kidney disease.
We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future, Ryan admitted Friday. I don't know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land.
And Congress this year repealed the tax penalties associated with the individual mandate that most people obtain health coverage, effectively ending the mandate and removing a key incentive for less-expensive healthy consumers to pay into the insurance system. That will cause premiums to rise for those who remain in the exchange market.
Some of the administration's decisions have actually made it easier for people to buy comprehensive coverage, although by all accounts that was not intentional. In particular, the administration's decision to yank some of the subsidies that insurers get under the law ended up making coverage more affordable for some buyers, because it meant they were eligible for more financial assistance. But the administration has not stopped trying ― and that includes through the courts.
Single-payer groups and activists are reflexively suspicious of Primus after The Intercept revealed that he had spoken to insurance executives and laid out his own objections to Medicare for All.
It might not be fear, Vaughan said. It might be fewer people.
Obamacare Repeal Still On The Agenda
To get covered, Americans will have to navigate the country's fragmented health care system ― there's the ACA, known as Obamacare, public options like Medicaid, and COBRA, the federal program that lets individuals continue their former employer's health care plan at personal cost. As HuffPost's Jeffrey Young explained, there are barriers to all these options.
By the middle of 2009, Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative South Carolina Republican who had riled up Tea Party activists by promising that defeating reform would be Obama's Waterloo, was setting the tone on health care. Grassley, facing the threat of a conservative primary challenge, started talking about death panels at events back home. And in a meeting Obama later described in his memoir, the Iowa senator told the former president there was no concession that would win his vote.
Near the end of the conversation, I thought back to something Obama said at the March 2010 signing ceremony: We are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities. We are a nation that does what is hard. What is necessary. Had the difficulty passing and implementing Obamacare shaken that faith?

Almost No Legal Expert Thinks The Case Has Merit
Although scientists are still learning about the novel coronavirus and its effects, they have known from the beginning that the groups most likely to suffer severe, life-threatening symptoms are the elderly and people with serious underlying medical conditions.
Fear is a constant, he said, and these days many of his friends who don't have papers stay close to home. So, he said, gesturing to an extra bag of groceries from today's food pantry, he does what he can to help them out.
Trump Is Stuck In 1980s New York City
But one difference between the fight over the Affordable Care Act versus abortion was that on the ACA, most of the battle was in Congress ― and getting rid of GOP members who wanted to repeal the law. But on abortion, much of the fight rests with the Supreme Court, symbolized by the fact that the protest was on the steps of the institution Tuesday.
You want a social safety net that gives you things when you lose your job — that's why we have unemployment insurance, Miller said. It would be nice if your health side also looked more like that across the U.S.
In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security started a partnership, the Secure Communities program, that cross-checked the fingerprints of people arrested at the local level with the agency's database of deportable individuals. The program ran until 2014, and was reinstated last year. It resulted in the deportation of more than 363,000 immigrants charged with crimes.

Obamacare got some serious attention in Sunday's town hall debate, following an audience question about why insurance seemed to be getting more and more expensive, while covering less and less.
You can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true. Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation
I often say that knowing when to leave a party is an Art Form.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates there are 5.7 million people who are not eligible for financial subsidies under Obamacare, and who would have to pay for the entirety of their private insurance plan. COBRA too is cost-prohibitive for many families. The average monthly cost for individual coverage in an employer-sponsored plan is $490, amounting to nearly $6,000 a year — a steep cost for someone without an income.
In fact, the agreement has forced Iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. The $1.7 billion the United States gave to Iran was money it held in U.S. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by U.S. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.
So it makes sense that Donald Trump just named McCaughey to his team of economic advisers.
And in that WZZM interview, James dodged questions for a full 10 minutes while correspondent Nick LaFave repeatedly (and admirably) tried to get him to offer something, anything, resembling a specific proposal. The most James would say is that he thought more transparency about hospital prices would bring down prices through competition and that I believe the decision-making should go to the people, not the federal government.
But Trump's hold on the crowd had as much to do with party as personality. People at CPAC approved of Trumpism as much as, if not more than, Trump himself. And their loyalty to the party was, perhaps, supreme.
Almost immediately after Obamacare went into effect, rates of uninsured dropped and Medicaid coverage jumped to over half of all patients.
It's a head-scratching political move. During an election year that's shaping up to be a disaster for the Republican Party, its national leader and prominent officials around the country are taking a strong stand against enabling sick people to go to the doctor.
One of the most striking things about the final night of the Republican National Convention was the degree to which speakers singled out New York City as an embodiment of the failures of urban Democratic rule.
Palin was and remains a beloved figure to many parents with special needs children. But her claim about the health care legislation was as off-base as McCaughey's.
Navigators also target people with special needs, including those with complicated medical or financial situations that make eligibility for federal programs confusing. These are precisely the sorts of people who might not respond to routine advertising or find the help they need through commercial brokers.
Those focus-group-tested slogans sound great! Except they're hogwash.
This is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation I've seen in the Senate, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday. The American people need to learn more about what's in it.
Since enrollment started in 2014, the Affordable Care Act brought significant changes to Denver Health Medical Center, a safety-net hospital with the busiest trauma center in Colorado. Historically, nearly two-thirds of patients were either uninsured or covered by Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.
While Republicans claim they want the law to protect both people with pre-existing conditions and people who rely on government programs for health coverage, those ideas are ideologically at odds with fundamental tenets of American conservatism. Lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller federal government are incompatible with a safety net worth its name.
A primary goal was to help people likely to struggle with medical bills because of their physical condition or finances ― which is why, for example, Democrats wanted to prohibit insurers from denying policies to people with pre-existing conditions and to improve coverage of prescription drugs for seniors.
The benefits of restoring the CSRs, as they've come to be known, are more ambiguous than the benefits of funding reinsurance.
That's not how immigration enforcement works, she said.
Trump's demand was an audacious act of political brinkmanship, designed to rattle and win over dissident Republican lawmakers who, for various reasons, were objecting to the bill.
If the action against Obamacare by Trump's DOJ succeeds, some 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance amid the COVID-19 crisis.
Trump rattled off a litany of policies his administration has implemented or proposed, ranging from relaxing health insurance regulations to attempting to lower drug prices, few of which have amounted to anything.
Trump also took aim at Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's health care plan ― or a caricature of it, anyway.
Pigs were mentioned with enough regularity to make you hope one of them would be brought in to dinner with a gilded apple in its mouth. Or someone would use the word swine. I can't believe it's not bacon!
James tried to deflect the anger by insisting that, notwithstanding his support of repeal, he was committed to preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions. He lost anyway.
Immigrants must have lived legally in the United States for five years to be eligible to receive SNAP benefits. A few other immigrant groups — refugees, asylees and the elderly — also are eligible to receive food stamps. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible, although many of them work and pay taxes. Immigrants living in the United States are twice as likely as U.S. citizens to be poor, despite working at the same rate.
Don't let Democrats do to America what they've done to New York. Rudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor
What we have found is not that people are so crazy about Joe Biden. It's that they really love President Obama, King said.
According to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based think tank that favors limited immigration, if the decline in SNAP enrollment is a result of the Secure Communities program, that could be because of the overreaction among the groups that work with immigrants in the community.
The same can be said about when to not attend a party. I don't know if it was gall or insouciance but Jared and Ivanka's presence was wrong and troubling.#McCainFuneral — Martine St-Victor (@MartineMontreal) September 1, 2018
For Trump's true believers, it is precisely that bulldog nature that makes him such a draw. Standing outside the hotel where the conference was held, Nigel Farage ― the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, Brexit champion and closest approximation to Trump that England can offer ― scoffed at a query about what Trump might do to possibly disappoint.
And all of them, they say, are afraid.
No, it did not — although, contrary to what some Republicans say now, it was not for Democrats' lack of effort. In addition to believing in bipartisanship as a virtue, Obama could count votes, especially in the Senate, where a small-state bias gave conservative states disproportionate power ― and where the filibuster was becoming a de facto, 60-vote requirement for all legislation.
If he told the same lies that Hillary Clinton was caught in ― using a private email server for public business ― I couldn't vote for him then, said Andrew Pace, 19, of Florida, who wore a Make America Great Again hat signed by conservative media provocateur James O'Keefe as he walked the hotel halls. But even then, I'd vote for another Republican candidate. Either that or [Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). I love Tulsi.
Then, deploying his trademark sarcasm, Sanders panned the logic of Republicans and some Democrats who defend the current payment system.
The energy on the left was on display Tuesday, as activists turned out around the country ― more than 500 events were planned ― for a national day of action to support women's reproductive rights.
In subsequent remarks, both Trump and Ryan indicated they were ready to move on from health care to other issues.
Fun fact: Obamacare, better known as the law, already does that. — Rose Benson (@NotoriousRBF) August 8, 2020
Republican officials, who have spent the last eight-plus years trying to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act and its provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions, have in recent weeks been saying they are not actually doing the things they are doing.
Al Diaz/Miami Herald via Getty Images Donald Trump named a woman to his economic advisory team who has repeatedly lied about public policy proposals.
Following publication of this article, it came to HuffPost's attention that Harris had in fact received contributions over $200 from 14 people who appeared to be pharmaceutical executives. The Harris campaign told HuffPost it had already returned two of those donations and was in the process of returning 10 more. The campaign said it wasn't sure whether the other two are from pharmaceutical executives and is seeking clarification.
I think what we got wrong was underestimating ... the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled. Former President Barack Obama
Eliminating the filibuster would mitigate, although not eliminate, the small-state bias ― and Obama said that may be necessary. When I pressed to see if he'd endorse the idea more clearly, he said, That's a longer argument and discussion to have. (Several months later, at the funeral of Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Obama offered a stronger endorsement for ending the 60-vote requirement, though he was specifically speaking about voting rights legislation.)
Navigators also target people with special needs, including those with complicated medical or financial situations that make eligibility for federal programs confusing. These are precisely the sorts of people who might not respond to routine advertising or find the help they need through commercial brokers.
Last year's cut forced navigators to lay off staff, cancel events, and, in some cases, cease operations altogether. This new cut will leave navigators with just a fraction of the money they had available for the open enrollment periods that occurred during President Barack Obama's administration ― in all likelihood hampering their ability to help consumers through the complicated process of choosing a health insurance policy and applying for financial assistance.
They could change their minds of course. And the pressure to enact these policies could build, thanks to a progressive movement that is already louder and more organized around goals than it was during Obama's presidency. But even if Democrats succeed at reducing structural barriers to change, and even if a progressive movement succeeds in demanding more action, legislation is likely to be full of compromises and fall short of Democrats' loftiest goals, just like the Affordable Care Act did.
The fact that they haven't been able to come up with something, Obama said, indicates either bad faith on their part or the fact that we were pretty thorough and looking at all the options and we arrived at what was the most realistic way to deliver universal health coverage.
You can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true. Larry Levitt, Kaiser Family Foundation
Unless that changes, the outcome will depend on the Supreme Court, where nothing is guaranteed.
It's up to advocates working with immigrant groups to do all they can to allay the fears of immigrants, Vaughan said, to let them know, no one will be deported for receiving food stamps.
They're afraid if they do anything, they'll be deported, Monestel said.
Sanders' transformation is evident in his policy agenda. The inclusion of abortion coverage in his single-payer health care bill won plaudits from women's groups. He commemorated the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination in Memphis, Tennessee; held an anti-poverty rally with civil rights leader Rev. William Barber, in Durham, North Carolina; and convened a live panel discussion on economic inequality that prominently featured people who specialize in the unique barriers facing Americans of color.
The proof is in the rhetoric of Republicans, who claim to support these goals as much as Democrats do, while promising supposedly better alternatives they've never been able to pass as legislation.
And let's not forget what Congress did last year, even though that's what GOP candidates want everyone to do.
Just last week, a report from the Congressional Budget Office predicted that removing the individual mandate but keeping other Obamacare provisions, such as the pre-existing condition guarantee, would lead to premiums jumping by 20 to 25 percent within a year, above and beyond current projections.
The less generous plans that Verma and the Trump administration are touting, and that Monday's rule change will favor, frequently leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs if they get seriously sick or injured, precisely because they leave out benefits that people need when they have serious medical problems. Often, the buyers of these plans aren't even aware of the limits until it's too late, because deciphering the fine print of these plans is so difficult.
The Affordable Care Act originally had a reinsurance program that expired after three years. The Alexander-Collins proposal would start it up again, for another three years, reducing premiums by 10 percent on average in 2019 and by 20 percent on average in the two years after that, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
Don Polite, 28, of Columbia, said he was supporting Warren after seeing her policy team emphasize Black women. Early in the campaign, several Black activist communities praised Warren's plans for addressing racial inequality head-on.
Two weeks of the major party political conventions delivered 16 hours of prime-time programming, more than 120 individual speakers, dozens of pre-produced glossy videos and zero fundamental change in the race.
If Sanders or other national Democratic leaders are going to bring national attention to Republican policies in the state that have led to hospital closures and higher utility bills, Robertson said, Let 'em come.
Trump is part of a lawsuit the Supreme Court is scheduled to take up in November (after Election Day, of course) that could eliminate the whole law. This, in fact, is Trump's vision for health care reform, not whatever bogus claims he makes to get him out of a political jam he put himself in by joining a legal case originated by a bunch of Republican state officeholders.
As always, VP Pence makes the list for his rapturous gazes at Trump at every meaningless White House meeting and ceremony, and for generally working to validate this disgraceful president. And for not immediately defending his wife Karen Pence's honor when Trump told a July 4 White House gathering that he had never before heard the term second lady but that Mrs. Pence is some lady, that I can tell you.
That's an important shift because sometime this month the agency is expected to publish a regulation that would permit consumers to carry these plans for a full year. That means the plans will be competing for business more directly with the comprehensive insurance listed on the exchanges.
The term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what Trump is perpetrating. His claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
But this week Secretary of Defense Mattis joined the Trump administration's attack on civil rights, and particularly LGBTQ rights, delaying for six months a Pentagon plan approved in the Obama administration to permit transgender recruits to enlist in the military. Mattis said the plan would give the Defense Department more time to study the issue, and insisted that the delay in no way presupposes the outcome of review, but LGBTQ advocates noted that the Obama order was issued a full year ago, giving the military branches sufficient time to address concerns, and conservative groups cheered the decision and expressed hope the Obama decision would be cancelled. The order already prohibited the armed forces from kicking out existing service members for coming out as transgender, and there's been no showing of national security danger from allowing transgender Americans to serve openly. Blocking basic anti-discrimination protections for people who want to serve their country, just as the Pentagon previously did with gays and lesbians, is plain wrong.
Generally we'd like to avoid including generals Mattis and McMaster in our rankings because, although Trump's over-reliance on active duty or recently retired military personnel for national security jobs is concerning, at least these men are qualified for their positions and are a major improvement over Trump's favorite good guy, the corrupt, vengeful hothead Michael Flynn.
In our interview, Obama still seemed taken aback that Republican state officials were refusing to expand Medicaid eligibility, as the Affordable Care Act envisioned, even though the federal government had committed to covering most of the cost and literally millions of low-income Americans scattered across states like Florida, Georgia and Texas stood to get insurance.
Some would end up not getting coverage at all, which is why, according to the CBO, the number of people without insurance would actually rise if the Alexander-Collins proposal became law, although the increase would be small.
Sitting in the front, Biden was a newcomer here at Bethlehem Baptist Church. But Rev. Anthony McCallum, an early endorser of Obama's in 2007, had already called him family. On Sunday he told his congregation that he sees in Biden what he saw in Obama, to roaring cheers.
But since November's election, when Republicans swept the White House and Congress, Denver Health has deferred $73.7 million-worth of construction projects that had been planned to serve more low-income residents, many of whom were newly insured under Obamacare.
Pretty scary! And totally untrue. Completely, 100 percent false. Zero correspondence with reality. But McCaughey's nonsense took off. She made the same claim in op-eds for The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. When Sarah Palin picked up the idea, the mandatory meetings morphed into Obama's death panel. Conservative media and Republican politicians went wild.
But the lawsuit has already gotten favorable rulings from three lower court judges. All three were Republican appointees, just like the Supreme Court majority, which now numbers six conservatives, with Amy Coney Barrett recently placed on the bench.
Just hours after his inauguration on Friday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the HHS to waive, defer, grant exemptions from taxes and penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act.
Republicans have offered a number of bills intended to show their commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions ― a move designed to blunt Democratic attacks over health care in 2020.
Season Six is thrilling beyond measure. The show is going out in a blaze of glory. I had to take Valium midway during last Sunday's episode because I thought I'd never get to sleep after the non-stop excitement.
On Twitter, physician-author Atul Gawande said what most analysts listening to Trump were probably thinking: I am still trying to decipher what Trump proposed as a health policy and I have no idea what he was talking about.
Republicans are even inventing Washington Post fact-check articles that supposedly called their Democratic opponents liars for saying Republicans are lying about pre-existing conditions. Some GOP senators went so far as to introduce fake legislation about pre-existing conditions. It's a lot of lying.
We will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources. Jodi Ray, project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families
Those kinds of compromises are frequently deflating. That doesn't mean they should be, and the Affordable Care Act is an example of why. It still achieved a lot ― more, in fact, than even many liberals seem to grasp. It's already transformed the political conversation on health care, so that the principles of universal coverage now have wide acceptance.
The spending cut is not the only change that CMS announced Tuesday. Going forward, it will encourage navigators to educate consumers about skimpier alternatives to traditional insurance ― including short-term, limited-duration plans that frequently leave out basic benefits, such as prescription drugs, and are unavailable to people with pre-existing conditions.
Shutting down the law would mean shutting down the center and its programs, with unknown consequences for the health care providers participating in them.
Insistence upon these abortion restrictions undoubtedly reflects genuine policy preferences from conservatives. It also reflects a political calculation ― namely, that Republicans can't afford to alienate supporters who are strongly opposed to abortion, Obamacare, or both.
Those fees, he argued, are nothing less than taxes on the middle class.
Miller also described the potential for a downward financial and health spiral for some Americans, calling it a double hit.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and many Republicans have pushed back against the need for additional stimulus during the pandemic, saying they see no urgency in passing a fifth relief package. But among the ideas Republicans have put forward, like expanding the PPP program, implementing tax credits for hiring workers or bonuses for rehired workers, health care has largely been left out of the emergency relief debate.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA, encouraged Americans to sign up for Obamacare if they lose their health insurance.
There are plenty of other reasons the speech's effect will be limited: The inappropriate use of the White House and lack of social distancing among the Rose Garden crowd will overshadow the speech's content, and two bigger news stories ― the aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast ― may overshadow its existence entirely.
Trump is again this week's number one in Republic Report's Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings. Trump is not merely a disgrace; he's a total and complete disgrace.
If the court decides to throw out the Affordable Care Act, even in part, devising a replacement will fall to whoever is in the White House and whoever is running Congress. In other words, a lot would depend on who wins in November and what they are prepared to do.
It's very challenging to plan for your future in an environment like this, said Beth Feldpush, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America's Essential Hospitals, a group that represents safety-net hospitals nationally.
But it was all based on nothing. McCaughey's influence enrages actual policy experts who read legislation and accurately dissect the implications of new programs. As the typically measured Ezra Klein put it in The Washington Post in 2009: Betsy McCaughey is really just a horrible, evil, awful, lying person who wants to make the world worse for people because that's her ticket to increased TV time. There's no other way to put it.
The basis for the lawsuit is the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. As originally written, the health care law imposed a financial penalty on people who could get insurance but did not.
Ivanka and Jared said nothing when a WH staffer joked about McCain's death. They stayed silent while Trump attacked McCain repeatedly. Whether they were invited or not, Ivanka and Jared should have stayed home. — A Little Royal (@alittlebitroyal) September 1, 2018
Legal reasoning is always subjective, but even lawyers who enthusiastically supported other lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality have dismissed the case as nonsense.
Government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost, she posted on her Facebook page. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.
This trend gives Obama something to boast about when it comes to his signature domestic achievement, but the Affordable Care Act still faces considerable challenges in the next few years that could jeopardize these gains in coverage. Obama has floated policies to fix some, but not all, of the problems with the law.
Twitter went bonkers over Trump's announcement.
I'd stand behind him until he is impeached, said Eric Finch of West Virginia. Because he is my president and I respect the office and the process. I'd probably go out and call for his impeachment if he shot someone. But there has to be a process. And I imagine there would be a story. Maybe the guy attacked him, or Secret Service wasn't there.
But reconciliation isn't a cure-all for the Senate's structural problems, especially given the strict, quirky rules about what provisions can even pass through that process. And at least for the moment, ending or even reforming the filibuster seems to be off the table.
At the same time, the administration is loosening regulations on certain types of health insurance policies to allow insurers to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions. That's part of Trump's ongoing campaign to sabotage the Affordable Care Act's health insurance markets.
The legal theory of the plaintiffs includes a series of arguments that scholars from across the political spectrum have criticized and, occasionally, mocked. How can there be a command to get insurance when the consequence for disobeying it is literally nothing? Do the people bringing the lawsuit even have standing to sue?
And on top of everything else, Republicans were fighting an increasingly skeptical public. Multiple polls have suggested the GOP measure is deeply unpopular, while the law it aimed to replace, long the subject of controversy and the object of scorn among conservatives, is now becoming more popular.
Steel noted that Biden's assignment of implementing the Recovery Act was an implicit admission that job creation wasn't Obama's top focus.
Even without the rare moments of honesty, however, we would know this is what Republicans want because of the simple fact that they've been trying to slash health care programs for decades.
Donald Trump has lost the presidential election, but his last, desperate effort to kill the Affordable Care Act will get its day before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, when the justices hear arguments in a Republican-backed lawsuit alleging that Obamacare is unconstitutional.
I was never under an illusion that we would get majority Republican support, Obama said. But it was my belief that a law signed by Mitt Romney, and that could be traced back to ideas that had appeared in the Heritage Foundation literature, would give some political cover to those Republicans who were so inclined to vote for it.
Our conversation took place in early March 2020, well before anyone knew Joe Biden would win the nomination and become president this year, or that Democrats would also have full control of Congress, or that the overwhelming political priority would be dealing with COVID-19. And strictly speaking, the interview with Obama wasn't about how Democrats should govern. The subject was the Affordable Care Act, for a new book about the law's history that is coming out on Tuesday.
A Ruling Against the Law Would Unleash Chaos
If campaign season starts up in 2020 and there is no bricks in the [Mexico] wall, I would have to say, at that point, 'O.K., what's going on? Edward eventually conceded.
Granted, building coalitions around ambitious proposals takes time and building movements around them on the campaign trail only helps. But as heated as the debate over Medicare for All has been so far, the presidential candidates who support implementing some permeation of it will have to convince more of their Democratic colleagues in the Senate to support it if it has any chance of becoming law in the near future.
Insurers could go back to screening customers for health status, as they did before the health care law took effect, charging higher premiums or denying coverage altogether to people who have histories of cancer, diabetes or even plain old allergies.
But a minority of consumers must pay full premiums, because their household incomes are more than four times the poverty line. (That's about $100,000 for a family of four.) And in some parts of the country, like Iowa and Tennessee, premiums have skyrocketed ― partly because of design flaws in the 2010 health care law, and partly because of Republican efforts to undermine its implementation.
Health care remains the No. 1 issue for voters, according to public opinion polling, and Republicans remain on the defensive following a Democratic midterm romp.
We will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources. Jodi Ray, project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families
They understood that the death panel charge had always been a lie ― that it was Obamacare's opponents, not its supporters, who were threatening the medically vulnerable.
Polling shows Biden leading Trump by significant margins among young people, both nationally and in key swing states. But top Democratic operatives have long worried about young people's relative lack of enthusiasm to actually cast a ballot in 2020 and fear it could prove politically deadly in a close race.
Three years ago, when I was in South Carolina and other states campaigning, my opponent and editorial writers all across the country ... they said, 'Bernie Sanders is nuts. He is far out. His ideas are extreme. Nobody supports those wild ideas,' he said with a mock sense of alarm. Well, guess what happened folks? Three years have come and gone, and those ideas that were seen to be radical and extreme three years ago are today mainstream, supported by the vast majority of America.
The case, known as California v. Texas, is the third such challenge to reach the high court since the law's 2010 enactment. And the stakes are as high as ever. If the justices wipe out the Affordable Care Act, as 18 Republican state officials and the Trump administration have asked it to do, roughly 21 million Americans could lose health insurance, according to independent projections.
In Colorado, an ad for Sen. Cory Gardner, who also supported repeal legislation, showcases his mother, a cancer survivor. Then he promises to protect people with preexisting conditions no matter what happens to Obamacare.
Mary watched racing cars and 1) didn't experience any PTSD and 2) looked like her whole body had been Botoxed.
McGovern also noted in his statement that he worked with Jayapal and staff from the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to help plan the hearing. I am a cosponsor of this bill and I'm proud to convene the first-ever hearing on Medicare for All as Congress works toward universal coverage, McGovern said.
Psaki said the White House will work to explain the provisions to Americans in the jargon-free way Biden prefers.
But even if Hatch and Grassley were truly interested in bipartisanship, they did not speak for their party or for leadership, which from the beginning urged members to oppose Obama's agenda fully ― as Mitch McConnell, who was (and is again) the Senate minority leader, later admitted. All of this happened at a time when the GOP was also becoming more ideologically extreme, with conservatives displacing the remaining moderates.
Aside from Sanders' pledge, however, the speech served as an implicit rebuttal to Biden and other Democrats who have adopted conservative talking points in their efforts to discredit Sanders' plan.
The mandate is among the Affordable Care Act's most controversial features, but experts say it's essential for making the rest of the program work. It's basically a tax on people who decline to get health insurance, even if available coverage meets the law's definition of affordable.
President Donald Trump has continuously touted his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He has yet to put forth any legitimate legislation to take its place, despite his repeated attacks to repeal Obamacare.
Another person submitted to the committee for consideration told HuffPost that, while no one in the single-payer world wants to say this hearing is a farce, there's a significant concern it will be co-opted into a defense of the Affordable Care Act.
The death panel concept first got attention in July 2009, when Elizabeth McCaughey, an analyst and former lieutenant governor of New York, told a conservative radio host she had discovered an explosive feature of the Democratic health care proposal Congress was considering.
Such decreases may happen whenever the government cracks down on immigrants, a new study shows.

The mandate was always among the law's most controversial features and was the basis for the first legal challenge, which suggested Congress lacked authority to impose such a requirement. The court rejected that lawsuit, with Chief Justice John Roberts leading a 5-4 majority, on the theory that the financial penalty was simply a tax and Congress has the power to impose taxes.
Beyond the provisions on pre-existing conditions, if Republicans keep control of Congress next year, they will come for the Affordable Care Act again. But they still don't have a replacement plan that would protect people with pre-existing conditions or do any of the other things the Affordable Care Act did to slash the rate of uninsured Americans.
It's unclear how precisely that would work out because a law was enacted in 2018 to close the doughnut hole ahead of schedule. That legislation was a modification of the Affordable Care Act, and judges would have to sort out what that modification means if the ACA comes off the books.
But this week Secretary of Defense Mattis joined the Trump administration's attack on civil rights, and particularly LGBTQ rights, delaying for six months a Pentagon plan approved in the Obama administration to permit transgender recruits to enlist in the military. Mattis said the plan would give the Defense Department more time to study the issue, and insisted that the delay in no way presupposes the outcome of review, but LGBTQ advocates noted that the Obama order was issued a full year ago, giving the military branches sufficient time to address concerns, and conservative groups cheered the decision and expressed hope the Obama decision would be cancelled. The order already prohibited the armed forces from kicking out existing service members for coming out as transgender, and there's been no showing of national security danger from allowing transgender Americans to serve openly. Blocking basic anti-discrimination protections for people who want to serve their country, just as the Pentagon previously did with gays and lesbians, is plain wrong.
We want to know what will happen with the Medicaid expansion population, and what will be the timeline for that, said Peg Burnette, Denver Health's chief financial officer. Due to theuncertainty, we're not going to issue new debt. We have no plans for that in the near future.
I'd like us to put in place a better program than the one we have, the Obamacare program, but getting that in place for the country to take advantage of in the next few weeks is just not very likely, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said.
The Republican-proposed bill, set to come before the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday for a vote, would unwind the Medicaid expansion, cap federal payments to states and replaceObamacare's income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits. The bill would still need approval in the Senate if it clears the House this week.
Just as Donald Trump displays the shadow side of xenophobic white America, The Wall Street Journal's choice of this particular photo with this article unconsciously displays what many Republicans think but seldom say (even David Duke doesn't publicly say it anymore): We can't trust black people. They are lazy and when given the opportunity they will bilk the system. (They make marvelous singers, dancers, and athletes, but aside from their entertainment value, they are really quite a burden on society.) That is what The Wall Street Journal tacitly told its readers when it decided to publish that particular photo with that particular article.

Maybe market forces - ie. profitability - are incompatible or inapplicable when saving people's lives? Unless, of course, you believe that only rich people's lives are worth saving because their wealth is merely a sign that god truly loves them (c.f. Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism).
Among the provision's chief proponents was Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who thought the incendiary portrayals of it were nuts.
As attention turns to the 2020 Democratic presidential race, the 77-year-old Sanders benefits from his surprisingly strong showing in 2016 against Clinton, who began that race as the prohibitive favorite. But some party strategists believe a big reason for his success was voter antipathy toward her.
And in an interview with WZZM-TV, the ABC affiliate in Grand Rapids, James said, I understand firsthand how important it is to protect our family members and people with preexisting conditions. … I will not support any plan that pulls the rug out from under people.
I'm hoping this next episode they'll discover a roof leak, moles in the beautiful lawns, poachers, and maybe even a stolen snuff box which will bring the show full circle!
At Bethlehem Baptist Church, and later at the oyster fry in Orangeburg, Biden's remarks only touched on one policy issue: criminal justice reform. Notably, his platform is an attempt to backtrack his legacy on the issue. He said he would end mandatory minimum sentencing, and expunge criminal records stemming from marijuana convictions.
The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare, he explained. This is not our bill. This is their bill.
A big reason for that is the same one that checked liberal ambitions in 2009: the resistance of more conservative Democrats. Already two of them, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, have said they would oppose eliminating the filibuster. They've also expressed skepticism about ideas high on the progressive agenda, like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
We don't know what prompted DeVos to craft this gross misstatement and to implement this wholesale abandonment of protections for students and taxpayers against waste, fraud, and abuse by predatory for-profit colleges. We can only remind you that Robert Eitel, Senior Counselor to DeVos, was, when he joined the Department, an executive at Bridgepoint Education, a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior, and before that was at Career Education Corp., a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior; Eitel reportedly committed when he arrived to recuse himself from matters related to those schools and from the Department's review of the gainful employment rule, but apparently not to issues related to for-profit colleges generally. We also can tell you that Devos herself invested money in for-profit education, that Republicans in Congress have long done the bidding of the for-profit college industry, which has donated big money to the GOP, and that DeVos's boss Donald Trump owned his own for-profit real estate university, whose predatory practices were similar to practices of for-profit colleges that stand to benefit from DeVos's trashing of the Obama rules.
Lawmakers from both parties had collaborated in the late 1990s to create a new program for insuring children. The senators who led that effort were Orrin Hatch, the conservative Republican from Utah, and Ted Kennedy, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. At one point in 2008, a former Kennedy aide told me, Hatch dispatched his advisers to see if the two could work together on a universal coverage bill.
When did Aetna first determine that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of Humana?
Polls have shown repeatedly that Medicare for All's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether.
As Trump navigates his first year in office, his challenge will be keeping these types of voters in the fold as he confronts the tough realities of actual governance. A border wall won't be built quickly, and the repeal of Obamacare may never occur. The question is whether Workman, Edward and many others can forgive a lack of progress as quickly as they forgive Trump's idiosyncratic politics.
But it's no wonder why Trump and many Republicans running for office this year would try to make voters see something that's not there and deceive people about what the GOP actually wants to do to the U.S. health care system.
What exact costs will Aetna incur now that the Justice Department has challenged the merger? What costs will Aetna incur if the merger is ultimately blocked?
Obama's announcement was based on a report the Department of Health and Human Services published the same day, which found 17.7 million working-age adults became insured between the beginning of Obamacare's first enrollment period in 2013 and the close of this year's sign-up campaign last month. The department estimates 2.3 million adults under the age of 26 got covered through the law's provision allowing young adults to remain on their parents' policies.
The proposal under discussion now comes from two Republican senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine. Its focus is insurance for people who buy coverage on their own, either through HealthCare.gov, state exchanges like Covered California, or directly from insurers.
It's worth being extremely clear about why anyone is worried about people with preexisting conditions in the first place. After all, it's been a full decade since the Affordable Care Act made it illegal for health insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher rates to people based on their medical histories.
His appeal has yet to be tested in a field with several strong candidates ― a field that may well include Harris along with Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and former Vice President Joe Biden.
The Iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based Republican Party, which no longer exists, Tyler said. Trump's supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way. It's basically: 'Whatever Trump says goes, and that's fine with us.'
The speech jumped around from attack to attack ― hitting Biden for being weak on China, then for becoming allied with progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), then back to being weak on China, then to his support for late-term abortion, then back to Biden being a Trojan horse for socialists ― without sticking to any one cohesive theme.
Some states will keep working to expand coverage to the uninsured and keep it affordable and adequate, [and] in other states we'll see a race to deregulate, with the result that comprehensive coverage will be more expensive for those who need it most, Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University, said.
So that's where all the lying comes from. Fortunately, the truth is easy to find. If the GOP survives what's shaping up to be a brutal election year and retains control of Congress, rest assured they will again come for health care. They always try.
One Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity that Trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the Iran deal or policy issues generally. He doesn't know, the adviser said. And he doesn't care.
The news was first reported by Robert Costa of The Washington Post, who spoke to the president directly, following a meeting between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).
The other big initiative in the Alexander-Collins proposal would resume cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which are a separate set of federal payments to insurers that President Donald Trump stopped in October.
The second major lie was that Biden supports efforts to eliminate police budgets, part of Trump's efforts to portray Biden ― a veteran politician with a clear center-left ideology and track record ― as a stalking-horse for the left-most elements of the Democratic Party. If you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America, Trump said.
McCaughey, already notorious for dishonest attacks on President Bill Clinton from a decade before, was engaging in wild distortion. The provision merely required that Medicare pay for counseling sessions on how to write advance directives. That way, physicians would be able to carve out the time for seniors who wanted help making decisions about end-of-life care in the future.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Thom Tillis's bill allows him to say he stands with Trump on Obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
During the course of putting together the repeal-and-replace process for Obamacare, Trump never once reached out to a member of the Democratic leadership to discuss policy matters or vote counts. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office confirmed as much. So too did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office.
Biden ended his speech with one more poignant attack on Sanders' lifelong position as an Independent in Congress, and as a democratic socialist who has been critical of the Democratic Party.
Surprise bills are one of the worst aspects of the U.S. health care system, and that's really saying something considering how awful it is in so many other ways. Over the past couple of years, Congress has tried and failed to devise a solution to this problem that would protect patients from unexpected bills from out-of-network providers the patients often don't even know treated them.
Clinton gave a nuanced response. The Democratic nominee sketched out what she believes are the Affordable Care Act's strengths and weaknesses, vowing to address the latter with a series of modest changes that she'd outlined previously in her speeches and writings.
Likewise, a number of pilot programs to reengineer Medicare payments for health care, in order to improve the program's efficiency and promote better quality care, are now underway. The experiments are taking place through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which the Affordable Care Act authorizes and finances.
The roads around Bethlehem Baptist Church are lined with signs promoting Obamacare. The gas station around the corner from the church is named Obama Gas, its sign emblazoned with a portrait of the 44th president.
Gardner has justified that claim by pointing to the Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act, a bill he sponsored. But the entire legislation is barely 100 words long and is basically just a slogan, as multiple analysts pointed out.
The energy on the left was on display Tuesday, as activists turned out around the country ― more than 500 events were planned ― for a national day of action to support women's reproductive rights.
This time, the agency that runs the health insurance exchanges is slashing funds for organizations that help people to shop for coverage, forcing the groups to make do with about one-fourth of the federal funding they got for this year's open enrollment.
Making it easier to see hospital prices and giving consumers more choices might or might not improve health care access at the margins, but it's not a substitute for the structure the Affordable Care Act has put into place.
If a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don't buy him a knife, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Feb. 10, 2016 town hall. This Iran deal is the worst deal.
McSally is denying her change in tone marks a significant shift ― she said it was fake news when an interviewer asked her about it on Friday. But her new rhetoric, which comes after years of support for a full repeal of Obamacare and after a vote for a plan that would have increased costs and weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions, is representative of how Republican senators up for reelection in 2020 are approaching the law.
This article has been updated with Amash's comments.
Today Trump has arrived in European to represent our nation in crucial discussions with leaders of key nations. He's already insisted in a press conference in Poland that nobody really knows who hacked the U.S. election, even though the entire intelligence community told him it was Russia. With North Korea developing a missile that could deliver nuclear warheads to U.S. territory, and so many other dangers and challenges in the world, is this the man with which we are to defend America?
But he also expressed empathy for those frightened by a dramatic change in the system, encouraging them to see themselves in the traditions of presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, all of whom sought to expand health care coverage against the wishes of the private health care industry.
Medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, Indian Health Service reforms, the Medicaid expansion, FDA authority over generic biologics — all would fall by the wayside, Jost said.
Both parties recognize the stakes, which helps explain why the James-Peters race is on track to be the most expensive in the state's history. Much of that has gone toward television advertisements that focus on health care ― including one from Peters that features a 2017 video of James bemoaning the GOP's failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
An eerie Fox News video of Donald Trump talking about an economic crash and riots as a route back to when America was great has resurfaced as the longest government shutdown in U.S. history continues to fray services.
It's not hard to see why Republicans would try to cast themselves as guardians against rising crime in some cities ― to say nothing of the rioting that has spilled out from peaceful demonstrations against police misconduct, particularly in cities like Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Kenosha, Wisconsin. That's because it allows the GOP to shift from the politically inconvenient terrain of dismissing protests against police misconduct and racism, which a majority of Americans support, and turn to the stronger ground of condemning arson and property destruction, which already appear to be turning swing voters against Democrats in the general election battleground state of Wisconsin.
The precise effects of those changes on insurance coverage and the federal budget are unknown ― because Republican leaders, determined to rush a vote, would not allow time for the CBO to analyze the changes. In fact, it wasn't until late Thursday evening that leadership posted the text of the changes.
In our interview, Obama still seemed taken aback that Republican state officials were refusing to expand Medicaid eligibility, as the Affordable Care Act envisioned, even though the federal government had committed to covering most of the cost and literally millions of low-income Americans scattered across states like Florida, Georgia and Texas stood to get insurance.
He then challenged his fellow contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination to pledge the same, dedicating a new webpage on his campaign site to the appeal.
On Twitter, physician-author Atul Gawande said what most analysts listening to Trump were probably thinking: I am still trying to decipher what Trump proposed as a health policy and I have no idea what he was talking about.
It's worth being extremely clear about why anyone is worried about people with preexisting conditions in the first place. After all, it's been a full decade since the Affordable Care Act made it illegal for health insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher rates to people based on their medical histories.
Those people are the ones the Affordable Care Act affected most directly. Today, they can get comprehensive coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and a majority of them are eligible for federal tax credits that generally keep coverage affordable.
The generous explanation for these positions is that Republicans and their supporters have a principled opposition to government, for reasons that are philosophical, practical or both. The not-so-generous explanation is the suffering of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and meatpacking plant workers, simply doesn't matter that much.
On Tuesday, CMS justified its decision based on the navigator programs' results ― in particular, the fact that, according to official statistics, less than 1 percent of people signing up for plans on HealthCare.gov had enrolled through a navigator.
Having last week joined Trump and Tom Price in offering the old GOP deception that a bill cutting health care benefits is not actually a cut; and saying that people cut off from Obamacare could simply get jobs to fix the problem, even though many jobs don't come with health benefits, Kellyanne Conway offered up a new swipe at Americans who may lose some health coverage if the latest GOP health care bill is enacted. Addressing the impact on opioid addicts of GOP cuts to Medicaid, after Trump early this year pledged to expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted, Conway said such patients can overcome such funding shortfalls with a four-letter word called 'will.' Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), whose state saw nearly 2,000 opioid overdose deaths last year, responded that Conway owes an apology to the entire addiction and treatment community for her outrageous and disrespectful remarks.
Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, also panned the measure.
And, Hogue said, the Supreme Court can also be swayed by public opinion.
If the IRS 'delays' the individual mandate, the insurance markets in many states could go into a tailspin. Rates for 2018 will skyrocket and some insurers could fold, Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan and expert on Obamacare, explained at The Incidental Economist blog.
Almost immediately after Obamacare went into effect, rates of uninsured dropped and Medicaid coverage jumped to over half of all patients.
Yes, insurance companies wouldn't be allowed to refuse to offer coverage to someone who, for example, has a history of cancer or is pregnant. But they could sell someone a policy that doesn't cover cancer treatments or the birth of a child.
And here we see where Mister Ip is unequivocally misguided: further erode market forces in health care. Market forces concern profits; healthcare concerns saving human lives.
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron tried to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to remain in the Iran nuclear agreement during his White House visit this week.
Meanwhile, progressives in Congress either don't see how they're getting snowed ― or are unwilling to say it.
The claim was so outrageous that Politifact named it the lie of the year.
But consumers who use navigators frequently end up enrolling in Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program or other special programs ― or simply enrolling on their own, at home, after long consultation with navigators. As a result, they don't show up as enrolling in the private marketplace plans, which is the metric CMS is using to judge navigator performance.
Department of Health and Human Services The uninsured rate for working-age adults has declined since 2013, according to a new federal report.
The conversation with Obama, inside an office building not far from the White House, lasted for nearly an hour. He looked more relaxed than I'd ever seen him. He was wearing a black, open-collar shirt, casual dark gray pants and loafers ― and, as he gleefully pointed out, no socks. The best part of not being president anymore, he said of his attire. But he talked like he always did, with that deliberate, professorial cadence and sentences full of dependent clauses in order to capture every last nuance.
Granted, building coalitions around ambitious proposals takes time and building movements around them on the campaign trail only helps. But as heated as the debate over Medicare for All has been so far, the presidential candidates who support implementing some permeation of it will have to convince more of their Democratic colleagues in the Senate to support it if it has any chance of becoming law in the near future.
Downton Abbey should come with a warning label now, because Julian Fellowes is clearly going for broke in its final season.
Simply declaring in an executive order that people with preexisting conditions should be able to buy health insurance if the high court knocks down the ACA is entirely meaningless. If it were that simple, some other president would have done it already and become extremely popular. More than that, no president can just order an entire industry to not do something. That's why there's a Congress that passes laws.
What steps did Aetna take, prior to July 2016, to mitigate the risk that the Justice Department would challenge or successfully block its proposed acquisition of Humana?
Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, also panned the measure.
James, who has an MBA from the University of Michigan and works in his family's supply chain business, has played up his credentials as both a businessman and a fresh-faced, energetic outsider. It may be working.
The speech jumped around from attack to attack ― hitting Biden for being weak on China, then for becoming allied with progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), then back to being weak on China, then to his support for late-term abortion, then back to Biden being a Trojan horse for socialists ― without sticking to any one cohesive theme.
Clients may drop out for a host of reasons, such as frustrations with submitting paperwork, said Jared Call, the group's managing policy advocate. And as the economy improves, there's a decline in food stamp enrollment as well.

The GOP votes in 2015, especially in the Senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-Obama, anti-Iran and pro-Israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the Middle East, said Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden's national security adviser.
If the court decides to throw out the Affordable Care Act, even in part, devising a replacement will fall to whoever is in the White House and whoever is running Congress. In other words, a lot would depend on who wins in November and what they are prepared to do.
Who knows what's going to happen? Lacayo said, before dashing off.
The news was so major that it was touted in an official White House tweet.
I traveled to 48 states in this country. I have traveled to many, many African American communities and I have talked to a whole lot of people, he said. And I hope my views change in response to what I have learned.
Even at a time when doctors offices are closed and elective procedures are not going on — though as time goes on those things are going to be open — even being able to pay for your prescriptions is where having insurance versus not having insurance is going to make a big difference, Miller said.
1. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Last week's ranking: duh
In fact, as Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times pointed out on Tuesday, eliminating coverage requirements for the pre-existing conditions could have all sorts of far-reaching effects, making it difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for the federal government to distribute tax credits that today help millions afford coverage.
The following is adapted from Jonathan Cohn's The Ten Year War: Obamacare and the Unfinished Crusade for Universal Coverage, to be published by St. Martin's Press on February 23.

It's word of mouth, whatever their friends tell them, they take it as, 'It's going to happen to me,' Delcid said. And a lot of them are saying, 'Don't apply for benefits, you'll get deported.' We try to explain to them, 'That's not how it works.' But they just don't want to renew their benefits any more. They want them to expire.
Sessions also took a break from his work to help Trump's private prison owner donors, and to hurt gravely ill people who depend on medical marijuana, to appear last Friday on the morning show Fox & Friends. Despite his announced decision to recuse himself from the Russiagate investigation, Sessions offered thoughts on the Russiagate investigation, including, when pressed by the Fox hosts about concerns that special counsel Robert Mueller has hired lawyers connected to Democratic politics, this comment: Well, Mr. Mueller, is entitled, lawfully, I guess at this point, to hire who he desires, but I think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people. Fairly bland, but a less disgraceful attorney general could have said, I'm recused from this matter so I can't comment on it. Especially since a March 2 memo from Jody Hunt, Sessions' chief of staff, said the AG's commitment to recuse on the investigation covers speaking with the media: The Attorney General's recusal is not only with respect to such investigations, if any, but also extends to Department responses to Congressional and media inquiries related to any such investigations. George W. Bush White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter flatly told Politico that Sessions should not be doing this.
An April 2017 bill to make $15 the federal minimum wage, which once had paltry support from his colleagues, now enjoys majority support within the Senate's Democratic ranks. And most recently, Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) successfully pressured Amazon into adopting a $15 minimum wage.
And wouldn't you know it? It's the same crowd that was screaming about the specter of death panels a decade ago.
Below is how Mister Ip's article appeared on the Internet. And let me ask you, What is wrong with this picture?
They're afraid if they do anything, they'll be deported, Monestel said.
The brief was entirely consistent with President Donald Trump's long-standing hostility to the law, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress spent much of last year trying to repeal it.
The precise effects of those changes on insurance coverage and the federal budget are unknown ― because Republican leaders, determined to rush a vote, would not allow time for the CBO to analyze the changes. In fact, it wasn't until late Thursday evening that leadership posted the text of the changes.
Although scientists are still learning about the novel coronavirus and its effects, they have known from the beginning that the groups most likely to suffer severe, life-threatening symptoms are the elderly and people with serious underlying medical conditions.
Despite Biden's strength at the grassroots level among Black voters, groups that represent Black activists and other minorities haven't lined up behind him. The Florida-based racial justice group Dream Defenders endorsed Sanders, as did Center for Popular Democracy Action, a network of progressive community organizers looking to mobilize Black and Latinx voters. The Center for Urban and Racial Equity gave Biden an F rating on its 2020 scorecard, saying the most of Biden's plans do not explicitly mention race or racial inequity.
The change raises the stakes on the 2018 midterms, because it means, among other things, that state officials, many of whom appear on this year's ballot, will have even more power to shape (and reshape) their health care markets.
Unsurprisingly, it immediately received flak from both Sanders' and Biden's campaigns, who criticized it for going too far, and not far enough.
Hospitals typically lay out multi-year operating plans that prioritize investments, such as new clinics, medical wings, technology or other projects that help draw in more patients and increase revenue. In addition to enhancing patient care, these projects are vital to the local economy as a driver of jobs ranging from construction and maintenance to restaurants and transportation.
These findings, based on several surveys, are merely the latest proof that, whatever its shortcomings, the Affordable Care Act has succeeded in its primary goal of reducing the number of Americans who lack health insurance. The share of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance was 11.5 percent as of February, down from 20.3 percent in October 2013, according to the report. Other polls that include children and people over 65 show an even lower uninsured rate.
Today, Americans who buy insurance on their own can get tax credits if their income is below four times the poverty line (about $100,000 a year for a family of four). Those credits effectively discount premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year. They would be gone if the Affordable Care Act comes off the books, leaving millions to buy coverage on their own without that assistance.
It's a ridiculous question, Farage said, in between drags from his cigarette. It's a ludicrous question. I don't know. ... What you've seen in the first few days is his full intention to carry out his campaign promises. How refreshing.
The U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently arrested a number of immigrants in the center's neighborhood, and Lacayo worries about further actions. What if the United States revokes his residency?
Barrow discovered a weakness in Jug-ears and didn't do a happy dance but offered to teach him how to read. We all know where that can lead, don't we? First there's teaching, then there's reading, then there's skimming, then that day we read no further (look it up).
Trump celebrated Independence Day by visiting a golf course, a Trump course, of course, for his 35th time since inauguration day, after saying as a candidate that he would not be playing golf because he would be working all the time.
Donald Trump made a key promise during his presidential campaign to revise the nation's tax code while lowering taxes. However, upon closer examination of his recently released tax proposal, certain groups will benefit, while others may suffer economic harm.
Some of the state officials who started this lawsuit are trying to have it both ways.
But Biden now supports tougher enforcement and public investments as part of a Buy American program that he says would generate 5 million new manufacturing jobs. And the United States' trade deficit with China ― accompanied by the flight of manufacturing jobs ― has continued to climb during Trump's presidency.
As HuffPost has noted, though, it's a whole lot harder for Trump to paint himself as the solution to crime and civil unrest-fueled-rioting when those problems have exploded on his watch. He ran in 2016 on a similar platform; now he is asking for a chance to deliver on a promise he couldn't keep.
The GOP's Empty Promises On Health Care
The law gives the Department of Health and Human Services broad discretion to grant hardship exemptions to people who say they can't afford the mandate. There are signs that the Trump administration intends to use that leeway to minimize the penalty's impact, in ways that go beyond what the Obama administration did.
To make matters more disgraceful, DeVos justified her harmful decision with a gross misstatement. Gainful Employment regulations, she said in a press release, have been repeatedly challenged by educational institutions and overturned by the courts. DeVos was right that the rules had been challenged over and over by schools ― many of them the predatory schools that risked losing their federal aid under the rules if they didn't shape up and stop deceiving, overcharging, and under-educating students. But her characterization of what the courts had done with the rule was false.
Several attendees standing nearby were delighted, one gleefully declaring that Farage had gone full beast mode
Let's start with one big difference: The American Rescue Plan is starting off a lot more popular than the 2009 stimulus. A CNN poll released Wednesday found 61% of Americans support the plan, including 58% of independents and 26% of Republicans. Only 37% of Americans were firmly opposed to the legislation. Other polls, including one from the Pew Research Center, have found even higher levels of support.
Preexisting conditions have to continue to be solved, Perdue said. We have to figure out a way that people don't lose their insurance when they lose their job, and then we have to get after the real causes of health care costs.
Cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. Day one, I will rip to shreds the Iran deal, he repeated at a North Carolina rally on March 7, 2016.
The Individual Mandate And Why It Matters
Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.
Some of the state officials who started this lawsuit are trying to have it both ways.
Nhai Nguyen, 68, has been in the United States since 1991. She's retired now, and her 74-year-old husband is blind. Food stamps only take them but so far, she said, so they come to the food pantry at the Spanish Catholic Center. She worries constantly, she said, even though she is a naturalized citizen.
Two of Obama's favorite sayings are hard things are hard and better is good. Both apply in this case, and today's Democrats would do well to keep them both in mind.
The other campaigns know what they are up against.
Regardless of what happens now, health care is likely to remain a subject of controversy.
The gravest threat to the ACA's promise that even people who've been sick can get health insurance is a lawsuit brought by Republican officials in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The attorneys general in these states, most with the approval of their GOP governors, are trying to get the entire Affordable Care Act thrown out on dubious grounds.
This week's low point, perhaps, was the president's childish tweet of an old Trump pro wrestling video, modified to show him slamming to the ground and repeatedly punching a guy whose head was a CNN logo.
I have met with people whose first position is that they support Joe Biden but when I asked them kindly, warmly, please share with me some policies of his that you support ...they don't know, said Shaun King, a civil rights activist and surrogate for Sanders' campaign.
To celebrate our nation, Republic Report planned to take an Independence Day break from Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings, but by Sunday morning, when Rock 'Em Sock 'Em POTUS tried to knock CNN's block off, we were so deep into another week of Trump team disgracefulness that we had to punch through.
Almost No Legal Expert Thinks The Case Has Merit
While some GOP convention speakers stirred fear over crime and rioting, others, such as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Trump himself, framed a win for Biden as tantamount to selling the country out to China.
7. Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President. Last week's ranking: 8
The term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what Trump is perpetrating. His claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
John James, a Michigan Republican running for the U.S. Senate, represents one of the GOP's best chances to take a seat away from the Democrats.
You call that whatever the heck you want to call it ― it's not Medicare for All, he said Tuesday in an interview on CNN.
Two years later and still bashing the agreement, Trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the Iranian nuclear program.
In response, James has adopted a strategy Republicans around the country have used. In a widely circulating television advertisement and in interviews with local journalists, James has cited a family member's medical problems ― specifically, his son's asthma ― as proof that he would always look out for people with preexisting conditions.
Behind a belief in the necessity of bipartisanship was a faith that it was possible ― a notion that didn't seem as preposterous then as it does now.
Since shortly after Trump took office, his administration and the GOP Congress have taken a variety of actions to weaken the Affordable Care Act and its health insurance exchanges in particular.
Why Trump would expect to get Democratic votes when he was gunning to gut their primary domestic policy achievement and refusing to talk to them about doing so is not clear. But he clearly felt that it was in their self-interest to have worked with him even though he never asked. Speaking to reporters, the president said he expected Democrats to now be supportive of reform because they'd have no one else to blame when or if Obamacare collapsed.
Advocates for choice argued that public pressure can still make a difference. There are elected officials at the state level, and activists want to see Congress take steps to protect reproductive rights. Many people also felt encouraged that every major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate supports abortion, and some are even offering proactive measures to strengthen those rights.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents facing reelection, introduced one such measure this year, allowing him to say he stands with Trump on Obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
Denver Health Medical Center, for example, opened a new $26.9 million clinic in the city's southwest in 2016 to provide care to an area lacking in health services and saw more patients within six months than it had expected over two years. The health system planned to build or remodel five more facilities based on the new clinic's success.
In cities that began cooperating with Secure Communities, food stamp enrollment among immigrants dropped by 19 percent within five years, the report found. But in sanctuary cities around the country, there was no drop-off in SNAP and ACA enrollment. (The study included data from the Pew Research Center, which, like Stateline, is funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.)

But upon closer inspection, the conservative positions then and now have a common theme. It's about whose lives deserve the protection of government programs. And whose don't.
In his speech on Wednesday, Sanders focused on debunking arguments put forward by Biden and other centrist politicians and think tanks who have warned against a plan that forces people to give up the private health insurance they have in favor of something unknown.
When the Committee analyzed Trump's plans, by contrast, it determined that they would add $5.3 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years.
Less than 24 hours before, Trump had issued an ultimatum to the House, demanding a vote on what both he and Republican leaders had identified as a top legislative priority ― and threatening to move on to other legislative items if they refused.
But Thursday, at the filing deadline for the case, the Justice Department submitted a brief that sided with the states.
Another person submitted to the committee for consideration told HuffPost that, while no one in the single-payer world wants to say this hearing is a farce, there's a significant concern it will be co-opted into a defense of the Affordable Care Act.
Premiums are rising more quickly this year, with insurers requesting an average increase of 25 percent, according to Charles Gaba of acasignups.net. That's an average, with a great deal of variation ― and there are, in fact, people whose plans are getting dramatically more expensive next year.
But even as GOP presidential candidates lambasted the deal, Republican foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill understood that an international agreement that put the Iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. They passed a law that allowed Obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to Republicans who believed they needed it.
Don't let Democrats do to America what they've done to New York. Rudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor
Trump celebrated Independence Day by visiting a golf course, a Trump course, of course, for his 35th time since inauguration day, after saying as a candidate that he would not be playing golf because he would be working all the time.
I imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way, Mitchell said.
For weeks, Democrats have been in an internal policy debate around the issue of health insurance. House Democrats' latest relief package included several health care provisions, expanding how much the federal government chips in on Medicaid payments, and subsidizing COBRA at 100%. In other words, it would have the federal government temporarily foot the bill for the health insurance plans employers were once covering.
He's close to Obama and he believes in the same traditional things Obama believed in and that's my number one priority, said Jermaine Edwards, 36, of Orangeburg.
The campaign of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she already rejects the contributions of pharmaceutical executives, but likewise did not specify whether she would bar health insurance executives from doing so as well.
There's no way to know whether they accurately reflect what administration officials believe or how they intend to act. And it's anybody's guess as to whether Trump has personally settled on a course of action ― or if he even cares enough about policy details to decide on one.
But it is not just differences over reproductive rights that are standing in the way of passage.
In an interview aboard his district-traversing RV Sioux City Sue, Scholten dismissed the idea that Sanders' left-wing policies might be a political liability in his district.
Already, both sides are preparing their arguments. Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster at Public Opinion Strategies, predicted the legislation would get less popular over time as the public learned more about its non-COVID-19 provisions.
In the end, however, the effort was for naught. Leaders couldn't come up with language that would draw enough votes from the two holdout GOP factions to overcome the unified opposition of Democrats.
Other Democrats noted the stimulus was passed before the rise of super PACs and other well-funded outside groups with the capacity to spend millions promoting a law. Both House and Senate Democrats have affiliated nonprofits that can promote the Rescue Act in key states and districts, and Build Back Together ― a nonprofit aiming to boost Biden's agenda ― is expected to come online soon.
A president whose primary health policy objective is scrapping his predecessor's law that brought the uninsured rate to a historic low can't plausibly claim to be fixing the health care system. Obamacare is bad is not a policy, and anyone who expected Trump to finally, at long last, explain to the public how he would replace that law ― if such a person still exists ― has been disappointed yet again.
Scott Huffmon, a pollster with Winthrop University in South Carolina, emphasizes the importance of trust among Black voters in South Carolina.
Just to take one example, experts have warned for years that underpaid, overworked staff and weak inspection regimens put nursing home residents at greater risk of infection. But since taking office, the Trump administration has been rolling back safety regulations. As recently as three weeks ago, even as COVID-19 was continuing to ravage nursing homes, administration officials were defending that effort.
Voters will have to decide what's more believable: That 10 Republican senators are standing up for Americans who have pre-existing conditions or that this is a sham being perpetrated by the party that has spent the past two years trying to do the opposite.
The organizations will almost certainly respond by downsizing and scaling back services, so that they end up providing less help, reaching fewer people, or both.
Sanders argued, as he has before, that the middle class tax increases needed to pay for Medicare for All would be more than outweighed by the savings people would earn from the elimination of private health insurance plans' premiums, deductibles and co-payments.
As South Carolina's Feb. 29 Democratic primary approaches ― the nomination race's fourth contest in a state where Black voters make up the majority of the party's base ― Biden's lead in polls has not wavered. It's the state that was hailed as having solidified Obama's path to the nomination in 2008, and this year's primary comes just days before Super Tuesday, when voters in many of the big states — including Texas and California — go to the ballot box.
The South Carolina event, organized by the state chapter of Our Revolution, the group built to carry on the mission of Sanders' 2016 campaign, was billed as a Medicare for all rally. It was Sanders' first trip back to South Carolina since the primary battle in '16.
Two key areas of Trump's tax plan are the repeals of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the estate tax. The AMT requires individuals with a high number of deductions to calculate the amount owed in taxes under the normal rate and the alternative and ultimately pay the higher amount. While the AMT was intended to rid huge deductions by wealthy taxpayers, according to the Tax Policy Center, approximately 5 million people are now affected. The elimination of the estate tax would allow inheritances of $5.5 million for individuals and couples with estates over $11 million to transfer tax free.
The Obama administration expended tremendous effort shaping and nurturing the new system during its infancy and addressing problems as they came up. Now the Trump administration is in charge of managing these marketplaces, and its intentions are not clear.
Not surprisingly, it was Trump himself who took this to a ridiculous level last week when he tweeted: Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.
Requiring navigators to sell junk plans is the same as requiring doctors to offer snake oil ― the whole notion is outrageous, said Lori Lodes, a former CMS official from the Obama administration and founder of the organization Get Covered America.
Ending the filibuster wasn't on the political agenda in the way it is now. And Democratic leaders rejected the idea of using the budget reconciliation process, where they wouldn't have to worry about the filibuster, in part because they thought its complex parliamentary rules would prohibit essential parts of the proposal, turning legislation into Swiss cheese.
McSally, who later lost a Senate race for one of Arizona's seats before being appointed to the other, now has a different outlook. It's not about government-run health care or about repealing Obamacare in its entirety, she said in a campaign video earlier this month. It's about bringing the cost down.
Health care has become a defining issue of next month's midterm elections, and Republicans across the country, including President Donald Trump, are promising voters that they care deeply about protecting people with pre-existing conditions.
The decisions Democrats make all across America in the next few days will determine what this party stand for, what we believe and what we will get done, said Biden, who was declared the winner of the South Carolina primary within a minute of the polls closing Saturday night. We have the option of winning big or losing big.
What did White House national security adviser General McMaster do? Simply, he told reporters, regarding Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, There's no specific agenda — it's really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about. General, you're supposed to be protecting Americans, not scaring the fuck out of us.
Trump's speech Thursday nicely illustrates the convention's lack of impact. Trump rattled off a long, meandering list of already well-known or politically irrelevant accomplishments and repeated well-worn attacks on Biden. The speech came without any of the gusto that defines his most off-the-rails rally performances but with all of the lies and distortions he typically delivers.
Those people are the ones the Affordable Care Act affected most directly. Today, they can get comprehensive coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and a majority of them are eligible for federal tax credits that generally keep coverage affordable.
Either way, it's a lot more like a death panel than anything Democrats and their supporters ever tried.
Health care has been a politically damaging issue for Republicans, who before the pandemic repeatedly attempted to repeal Obamacare, end Medicaid expansion and significantly cut Medicaid funding. The Trump administration has continued to support a GOP lawsuit to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and pushed an effort to add work requirements for Medicaid. Since the pandemic, the Trump administration promised to use some of the coronavirus stimulus funds to reimburse hospitals treating uninsured patients with COVID-19, but there has been no plan to address the growing millions of uninsured Americans more generally.
The court's 7-2 vote struck a blow against the birth control mandate, a hotly litigated regulation under the Affordable Care Act that requires most private health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without a copay.
It might not be fear, Vaughan said. It might be fewer people.
Don't let Democrats do to America what they've done to New York, Giuliani said, declaring that Republicans were the true anti-racists for their vigilance against the ordinary crime that kills so many Black residents of major cities. For President Trump and for us Republicans, all Black lives matter.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions mysteriously cancelled his speech set for today (Thursday) in Philadelphia to discuss his heavy-handed efforts to pressure so-called sanctuary cities to stop providing protections for undocumented immigrants.

And that's just one example in which the courts would have to sort out modifications to the Affordable Care Act that Congress has passed since its inception.
5. Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States. Last week's ranking: 6
The only thing he could do to piss me off is to stop being Trump, said Innis, arguing that, with an immense sense of brilliance and strategy Trump picked Mike Pence as his vice president precisely for those who wanted political vanilla. If [Trump] isn't that non-nonsense pit bull that he is, then I would be upset. Then I'd be like, 'Ummm. We don't want THAT.'
The change raises the stakes on the 2018 midterms, because it means, among other things, that state officials, many of whom appear on this year's ballot, will have even more power to shape (and reshape) their health care markets.
I'm stunned Jared and Ivanka didn't squirm so hard they went into full body dry heaves. https://t.co/KW3rUGTs82 — Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) September 1, 2018
Courtesy Barack Obama Presidential Library. Joe Biden, seen here with then-President Barack Obama celebrating House passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, now has a chance to reinforce and build on the health care law in a way that Obama never did.
Hospitals typically lay out multi-year operating plans that prioritize investments, such as new clinics, medical wings, technology or other projects that help draw in more patients and increase revenue. In addition to enhancing patient care, these projects are vital to the local economy as a driver of jobs ranging from construction and maintenance to restaurants and transportation.
Early reports have suggested that insurers were expecting better performance this year, thanks in part to the higher premiums. But insurers are already calculating next year's rates and are supposed to finalize them by the spring. If they are not sure the mandate will be fully enforced next year, they could decide on higher premiums or even more exits from state markets.
Why The Health Care Debate Isn't Going Away
Trump's sycophant, fired transition head, and fellow climate change denier Chris Christie moved himself into final Governor DGAF status by mismanaging his state budget, closing state beaches for the holiday weekend, using his exclusive access to lie across one of those state beaches, and then barely trying to cover it up (with a baseball hat).
Ahead of a political rally last Saturday, there were signs that the state remained unwelcoming terrain for Sanders. Two of the state's veteran Democratic officials carped in the press that he should get lost, arguing that the visit was unhelpful in a conservative state where the party's candidates usually compete by tacking to the center.
Reynolds' rationale on the meatpacking plants and the Wisconsin court's thinking on the stay-at-home order, like the logic behind the broader push from some conservatives to ease social distancing rules, is that the costs of lockdown are too severe. Sacrificing the well-being of some more vulnerable populations is necessary, this argument goes, in order to alleviate the hardships on the rest of the population.
That will be the distillation of our message to the American people in the coming weeks, that help is here for them and their families, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, the White House deputy chief of staff who served as Biden's campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staffers. And we're going to carry that message to every corner of our country through travel, local press, and direct engagement in communities with the President, the Vice President, the first lady, the Second Gentleman, Cabinet members, and top officials from throughout the administration.
Some experts have warned that even hinting about efforts to undermine the mandate could destabilize Obamacare's already-fragile insurance markets.
And once again it is a subset of conservatives and Republicans resisting these steps, by seeking to end extensions of unemployment benefits and fighting aid to state and local governments that would finance other public services.
Trump is right in noting that there was no bipartisan appetite for his health care proposal. And certainly, when you start without any support from the other side of the aisle, it is hard to pass much of anything.
The death panel concept first got attention in July 2009, when Elizabeth McCaughey, an analyst and former lieutenant governor of New York, told a conservative radio host she had discovered an explosive feature of the Democratic health care proposal Congress was considering.
COLUMBIA, S.C. — On the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Joe Biden went to church in Barack Obama country.
Many of these people remember, angrily, the promise from President Barack Obama that they could keep their old plans if they liked them. And in states like Iowa, which have some of the highest rates for unsubsidized customers, GOP state officials have been among the most aggressive in seeking ways to weaken or eliminate the Affordable Care Act's rules.
Democrats are hopeful the Trump administration's lawsuit, which a federal appeals court is expected to hear sometime in July, keeps health care front and center in the minds of voters. Depending on court rulings and timing, the Supreme Court could rule on the lawsuit in the summer of 2020, not long before voters head to the polls. Democrats also note top Republicans have said the party will make another attempt to repeal Obamacare, given the chance.
And that's just one example in which the courts would have to sort out modifications to the Affordable Care Act that Congress has passed since its inception.
Three political appointees at Justice, along with one other career lawyer, ended up signing onto the federal government's brief. In court, they will square off against lawyers from states more supportive of the law and who have agreed to defend it.
The guidance under Obama... meant that a state's plan couldn't result in fewer people enrolled in affordable, comprehensive coverage, Corlette explained. This new guidance is saying that so long as people in the state have 'access' to [comprehensive] coverage, it doesn't matter what they actually do... If un-insurance spikes or there's a big movement to [less comprehensive plans] a state won't get dinged for that.
When asked in an April interview with HuffPost whether he had grown more sensitive to the need to speak to the particular challenges facing black Americans ― who comprise just a sliver of Vermont's population ― Sanders admitted that he had.
Matthew Edward, 23, came to CPAC from Illinois. Trump was his third choice for president, after Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. But on Thursday, he roamed the halls in a MAGA hat, perfectly content with how the administration was operating.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the new proposal would cause 14 million people to lose health insurance next year and 24 million by 2026. The bill has divided House and Senate Republicans and sparked fierce criticism from Democrats and leading medical and hospital groups, including the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association.

Having announced last month that she would launch a lengthy process to rewrite the rules developed under President Obama to hold predatory for-profit colleges accountable for ripping off students and taxpayers, Secretary DeVos announced online at 4:20 pm Friday before the holiday weekend that she was delaying key parts of one of the rules, called gainful employment. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) charged, appropriately, that the move would give predatory for-profit schools more time to take advantage of students, bilk taxpayers, and hide information about perpetually poor-performing programs from the public.

Those findings, which the CBO published early last week, halted the political momentum the repeal legislation had gained when it sailed through two committee votes earlier this month. As Trump administration officials and House Republicans began preparing for consideration by the full House, they quickly realized the bill lacked enough support to pass.
Check out what Trump had to say about disaster and making America great on Fox News at the 2:00 mark in the video above.
How many enrollees have contacted Aetna over its decision to withdraw from the ACA exchanges? What materials and resources is Aetna making available to assist consumers in selecting new health insurance coverage?
John has always said that if we repeal the ACA, there must be a replacement in place that protects people with preexisting conditions, campaign spokesperson Abby Walls told HuffPost.
I did not vote for you. Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life. I proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you -- particularly the ACA, wrote Brent Nathan Brown of Mosinee, Wisconsin. I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn't vote for you. Brown also introduced Obama at the event.
This is word salad worthy of Sarah Palin. Even the comprehensible parts don't make sense. Allowing insurance sales across state lines, for example, won't enable people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance. If anything, it will have the opposite effect, since some states have historically forced insurers to sell to all comers ― and allowing cross-state purchasing would render those regulations moot. Republican schemes to block grant Medicaid typically involve reducing the program's funding, which would, according to impartial estimates, vastly reduce the number of people who could get insurance.
With Democrats out of power in Washington, there's been no chance his most ambitious ideas could become law. But there's also clear evidence his proposals have picked up steam among Democrats.
Even at a time when doctors offices are closed and elective procedures are not going on — though as time goes on those things are going to be open — even being able to pay for your prescriptions is where having insurance versus not having insurance is going to make a big difference, Miller said.
But a lack of action on health care could have its own political consequences. If the polls are right, voters will hold Republicans, not Democrats, responsible for problems with the Affordable Care Act ― and for problems with health care more generally.
Medicare for All is one proposal. Medicare for All is the best proposal. Is someone going to make that case? Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program
Of course, Trump probably had no idea, either.
A super PAC funded by one of the Democratic Party's largest donors is reserving $11 million worth of digital advertising space targeting young voters, hoping that simply pointing them to the basic policy differences between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump will increase their enthusiasm to vote in November.
'Oh, everything is great, I expected to eat my grandma miles ago, now excuse me I've got to go salt my cousin,' Colbert added.
The Affordable Care Act strengthened Medicaid by funding new home-based care options for the disabled and elderly. These initiatives would lose their authorization, leaving decisions about whether to continue the programs in the hands of cash-strapped state officials.
Reynolds' rationale on the meatpacking plants and the Wisconsin court's thinking on the stay-at-home order, like the logic behind the broader push from some conservatives to ease social distancing rules, is that the costs of lockdown are too severe.

2. Scott Pruitt, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. Last week's ranking: 3
Most immigrants do not use food stamps and other forms of public assistance. The vast majority of food stamp beneficiaries — 92 percent — are U.S.-born citizens. Four percent are naturalized citizens, 1 percent are refugees, and 3 percent are other noncitizens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The average benefit for one person is $126.76 a month.
And people who want or need comprehensive insurance ― say, because they have diabetes or are cancer survivors ― are likely to have a harder time getting such coverage, because of how the markets will change.
But when the Detroit Free Press editorial board pushed James for details on how he would do that, he said he's not a healthcare expert and that he'd rely on experts to work out a market-based solution. The Free Press ultimately endorsed Peters.
Rebecca Cook/Reuters Republican John James, who is running for the U.S. Senate from Michigan, once called the Affordable Care Act a monstrosity. He has not offered details on how he would replace it.
I imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way, Mitchell said.
Another former colleague told The Washington Post, which was first to report the resignation, that the news of McElvain's departure was a gut punch.
And the consequences of a decision going in the other direction, wiping out the Affordable Care Act, would be enormous.
WASHINGTON — It's that time of the week — food pantry day — and before the doors even open at the Spanish Catholic Center, the patrons begin queueing up, lugging roller carts and empty grocery bags, the line stretching out onto the hot sidewalk. Immigrants all, they hail from the Congo and Costa Rica, from Nicaragua and El Salvador, from Togo and Vietnam. Most are seniors.
States would have to quickly decide whether to continue covering some or all of these adults with their own funds, according to Judy Solomon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It's doubtful many would be able to do that.
The plaintiffs insist the entire statute has to go because that is what Congress intended. But it was Congress, in 2017, that decided to zero out the mandate while fully aware that the rest of the Affordable Care Act would stay in place.
He has not said publicly why he is leaving, and he has not responded to emails from media outlets, including HuffPost, which tried to contact him last week. But the circumstances and timing could indicate it is connected with the Affordable Care Act lawsuit.
8. Thomas Bossert, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Last week's ranking: ―
The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the rules, arguing that they would have to cover the cost of birth control for people who lost coverage.
Not so long ago, I got to interview an expert on the matter: President Obama himself.
Still, it's a response, which is more than James has offered. It is one more reason to treat his promises on health care, like those from so many other Republicans, with extreme skepticism.
Pigs were mentioned with enough regularity to make you hope one of them would be brought in to dinner with a gilded apple in its mouth. Or someone would use the word swine. I can't believe it's not bacon!
You know what solves it? Trump asked, referring to Obamacare. When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster — then you'll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.
Sen. Lamar Alexander's office declined to comment on what Congress should do on health care, saying they had nothing to add at this time. The Tennessee Republican is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee in the senate. Offices for Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mike Braun (Indiana) and Rob Portman (Ohio), who sit on either the HELP committee or the Senate Finance Committee, which collectively have purview over Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare, did not respond to requests for comment.
Almost unbelievably, Trump's action on surprise billing is even more fake than his preexisting conditions nonsense. We will end surprise billing, he said. No, they won't.
The reality is that Republicans have never produced alternatives to Obamacare that live up to their lofty rhetoric. They didn't in 2017 and they aren't now.
It's hard to find a respected legal expert today who finds merit in this latest lawsuit. The basis for the states' argument is that Congress originally intended for the pre-existing conditions protections to operate alongside the mandate; if the mandate is gone, the lawsuit reasons, then the pre-existing protections should go too.

Abortion could take the same route in the next election cycle.
Democratic candidates running for president are in the middle of a heated debate about health care, one that will only intensify under the glare of television cameras as they take the stage in Detroit, Michigan, for the second presidential debate this week.
States have always had some flexibility to request these sorts of waivers, of course. But when the Obama administration was in charge, it set clear limits on state action. To get waiver approval, states had to demonstrate that residents wouldn't end up with worse coverage as a result.
Obama's focus on Republican opposition and its effects may sound self-serving to some people ― whether it's conservatives who blame Obama for polarizing the country, or progressives who think Obama is trying to avoid blame for compromises he should never have made. Reasonable people can certainly question individual decisions that Obama, along with other Democratic leaders, made at various points in the Affordable Care Act's history.
In 1994, she claimed that Hillary Clinton's health care reform plan would bar people from purchasing care outside the new Clinton system, which would cruelly ration treatments to curb costs. It wasn't true. The magazine that published the article would later disavow it.
And it appears that some of the Justice Department's own career lawyers feel the same way. Right before the Trump administration filed its brief, siding with the conservative states, three career lawyers who were supposed to file it withdrew their names from the case, offering an early hint that something was amiss.
The [Democratic] Party is pushing a socialist nightmare. Their plans will result in rationing care, denying choice, putting Americans on waitlist, driving the best doctors out of medicine permanently and delaying cures, Trump said.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article called Pete Buttigieg the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He is still the mayor.

Like stimulus ― what does that even mean to people? Psaki said, reflecting on how Democrats sold the 2009 bill.
By design, the mandate is sizable: It's either $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of a household's income ― whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family.
Palin was and remains a beloved figure to many parents with special needs children. But her claim about the health care legislation was as off-base as McCaughey's.
The ultimate futility of courting Republicans — so memorable today — is one of many grievances more progressive Democrats still hold over Obama's handling of the health care law. And in the popular imagination, it is the main reason Obama made so many key compromises, like dropping a public option — the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would offer a more efficient, more patient-friendly alternative to private insurance.
Over and over again, GOP leaders argued that their proposal represented the party's best chance to kill Obamacare. But efforts to corral Republicans failed, in part because leaders were dealing with two separate groups with divergent interests.
Even that figure doesn't capture the full extent of the consequences from a Supreme Court decision against the health care law.
The Republican-proposed bill, set to come before the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday for a vote, would unwind the Medicaid expansion, cap federal payments to states and replaceObamacare's income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits. The bill would still need approval in the Senate if it clears the House this week.
Death Panels In The Age Of Obamacare
Executive orders like these are little more than campaign press releases printed on fancier stationery. Since Trump doesn't have the interest or patience to actually work with Congress to make laws, he tosses off toothless executive orders and farms out his Obamacare repeal efforts to a court system he's packed with his own judges.
John James, a Michigan Republican running for the U.S. Senate, represents one of the GOP's best chances to take a seat away from the Democrats.
Downton Abbey should come with a warning label now, because Julian Fellowes is clearly going for broke in its final season.
Both national conventions had their emotional, viral moments ― Brayden Harrington's speech about his stutter at the Democratic National Convention, widow Ann Dorn's tribute to her retired police officer husband at the GOP celebration ― but neither had any type of game-changing moment to alter the fundamental story of the race: It is a referendum on President Donald Trump, with many voters disapproving of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, health care and racial justice. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has a steady but not overwhelming lead in polls of the most crucial swing states.
This decision reflects CMS' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated exchanges to their most cost-effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process, Verma said.
This time, activists see a turning point with not just Alabama, but with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, solidifying a 5-4 conservative majority. The threat of the court overturning Roe v. Wade is suddenly real.
But at CPAC, these types of comments, even from those proudly toting Trump paraphernalia, were the minority. Most attendees said that while they were uncomfortable with Trump's warts, they were able to overlook look them because he was a vessel for their policies.
Public opinion data suggests why some Democrats remain hesitant about embracing an entirely government-run health care program. Polls have shown repeatedly that Medicare for All's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether. When asked in a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll to choose between Medicare for All and proposals that augment the Affordable Care Act, for example, 36% of Democrats chose Medicare for All and 57% preferred plans that build upon Obamacare.
The plaintiffs insist the entire statute has to go because that is what Congress intended. But it was Congress, in 2017, that decided to zero out the mandate while fully aware that the rest of the Affordable Care Act would stay in place.
But Congress and the administration failed to come to a deal after intense lobbying by hospital and physician groups, and the private equity companies that own medical practices that make tons of money from surprise bills.
More recently, some prominent Republicans have seemed less than concerned about the plight of another vulnerable group in this crisis: workers at meatpacking plants. They, too, would be suffering less with more testing, protective gear, attention to their working conditions and leeway to stay home if they are at higher risk.
Many more Americans would lose Medicaid coverage because all but a dozen states have expanded eligibility to include everybody living below or just above the poverty line, providing coverage that's federally funded. That federal funding comes from the Affordable Care Act, and it, too, would stop if the law is no longer in effect.
Under guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services that takes effect immediately but likely won't affect insurance markets for another year, state governments will have new leeway to request waivers from some of the federal health care law's core requirements.
Trump's new solution? An executive order that directs the Department of Health and Human Services to start coming up with some kind of plan next year if Congress doesn't pass a bill by Jan. 1, 2021. He will instruct me to investigate executive actions and regulatory actions that we can take that will ensure that patients are nonetheless protected against surprise medical bills, is how Azar described it.
But if the lack of Democratic support was to blame for this governing debacle, Trump has no one to blame but himself.
If only there was something, we can call it the AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, and it can have exactly those types of protections and coverages and....oh right @BarackObama did that already. Seems like you are an expert at copy/paste. First #NAFTA, no the #ACA. #TrumpIsALaughingStock — The Voice Of Reason (@portarican_RT) August 8, 2020
The Republican Party's assault on the Affordable Care Act continued Monday as the Trump administration found yet another way to undermine the law's insurance rules.
One of the most shocking things I found in this bill, and there were many, is on page 425, where the Congress would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years, people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner ... all to do what's in society's best interest or your family's best interest and cut your life short. These are such sacred issues of life and death. Government should have nothing to do with this.
House Republican leaders on Friday pulled their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, signaling defeat on what was supposed to be a major legislative accomplishment for President Donald Trump.
It could be that three years out we are no longer making money, we are losing money, said Himler.
In addition to the cuts in enrollment assistance and advertising for the sign-up periods, Trump has cut two important funding streams to health insurance companies, the second of which his administration halted just days ago. The previous decision to cut off billions in payments owed to insurers resulted in significant premium increases for this year, and the latest one could do the same.
Food stamp enrollment in the past quarter has fallen by about half from this time last year, Aguirre said, even with increased outreach and after the center streamlined its application process.
Either way, it's a lot more like a death panel than anything Democrats and their supporters ever tried.
Oral arguments were presented in May via teleconference ― one of the first times in history for the court ― due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was the third time that the birth control mandate reached the Supreme Court, but the first since Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ― appointed by President Donald Trump ― joined the bench.
Trump's plan also increases the federal budget deficit and the national debt. The plan Trump has proposed, which was set out as a one-page proposal without any financial justification to back it up, never stated anything at all about how the federal budget will be impacted nor how the national debt either increases or decreases. According to the analysts from the Tax Policy Center, federal revenue is estimated to decrease by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years. The Trump economic team should hope that there will be the 4 percent economic growth they projected that will make up for the federal revenue decrease. But if there is a recession or economic downturn, then Trump's proposal will suffer serious consequences.
That's not the case today. Today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don't use federal dollars of any kind. In other words, insurers can't use money they've received in the form of premium tax credits. Back when CSR money was coming in, they couldn't use that money either.
The implication of leaving millions uninsured is a matter of life and death. A 2019 report on Medicaid expansion found there could have been 15,600 fewer deaths if all 50 states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. There's a growing body of research that has shown expanded public insurance has improved health outcomes, increasing preventative care and saving patients with chronic illnesses, like kidney disease.
These steps include dramatic cuts in funding for enrollment outreach and promotion, as well as a change in federal regulations that will allow people to hold on to limited-benefit, short-term plans for nearly three years. That change, along with repeal of the individual mandate's financial penalty for people who don't have comprehensive coverage, makes these short-term plans a more viable alternative for people.

Campaign ads attacking President Donald Trump's administration for trying to sabotage Obamacare are already popping up in congressional races.
Whether Obama could have pushed conservative Democrats harder, or picked different places to give ground, remains a source of disagreement between him and some of his liberal allies even today. What's not in dispute is that Obama always realized the law would need more work. That's why he talked about it as a starter home, with the expectation that it would be possible to bolster and expand the program over time, through a series of legislative and administrative fixes.
When evidence developed that the video Trump tweeted may have come from a reddit user who had posted racist comments in the past, that reddit user, name of HansAssholeSolo, apologized, which prompted Paul Begala to tweet,If only our President had the conscience and class of HansAssholeSolo. (Disgraceful Trump team members including Donald Trump Jr. then riled up the Trumposphere with the phony claim that CNN had blackmailed Hans.)
Congressional Republicans spent a good chunk of last year trying to repeal all or most of the Affordable Care Act, for instance, which already dealt with the problems of people with pre-existing conditions being shut out of health coverage or charged exorbitant rates. Against all evidence, these lawmakers constantly denied what they were doing, so we've seen this before.
A Pelosi spokesman, Henry Connelly, also said in a statement that the Rules Committee had free rein to choose whichever witnesses they wanted to articulate the strongest case for Medicare For All.
The boisterous health care rally showed the unique position Sanders occupies within the already-crowded field of rumored 2020 presidential contenders: He's done it before and he has the organizational muscle to show for it, even in a state like South Carolina where he fared poorly in '16.
Executive orders like these are little more than campaign press releases printed on fancier stationery. Since Trump doesn't have the interest or patience to actually work with Congress to make laws, he tosses off toothless executive orders and farms out his Obamacare repeal efforts to a court system he's packed with his own judges.
Trump is once again trapped in the unique New York City culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, when he first tried his hand at right-wing demagoguery. In 1989, Trump took out a full-page ad in New York City newspapers calling for the state to revive the death penalty to punish the Central Park Five ― a group of Black and Latino teenagers accused of raping a woman in Manhattan. When the young men were exonerated by DNA evidence decades later, Trump declined to apologize for whipping up public sentiment against them.
Negotiations to include the proposal as part of the big spending bill moving through Congress have broken down, as Peter Sullivan of The Hill first reported Monday. The primary reason is a dispute over federal funding of abortions: Republican leaders are insisting the proposal include restrictions that most Democrats will not support.
Sanders speeches in South Carolina and Iowa reflected this diversified focus. He called the criminal justice system broken and racist, and mused about how hypocritical Republicans are who preach small government, except when it comes to women's abortion rights.
At an oyster fry in Orangeburg, South Carolina, that same night, Biden would invoke Obama's name 13 times in a speech that lasted just shy of 20 minutes.
The president is declaring that it is the policy of the United States to provide protections to ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions are protected regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and its protections for preexisting conditions invalidated, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a conference call with reporters prior to Trump's speech.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/Getty Images President Donald Trump delivered a nomination acceptance speech on Thursday designed to paint him as a moderate and Democrats as radicals. It was one of his many lies.
Trump has said more than once that politically speaking, the easiest choice for Republicans would be to sit back and let the system operate on its own. Doing so, Trump predicted, would lead to a total collapse.
Requiring navigators to sell junk plans is the same as requiring doctors to offer snake oil ― the whole notion is outrageous, said Lori Lodes, a former CMS official from the Obama administration and founder of the organization Get Covered America.
Normally, the U.S. Department of Justice defends federal laws from challenges like this. Not this time. Instead, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is asking a federal judge to leave most of the law in place, except for the parts about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. No, really.
That, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.
Democrats say they won't make the same mistake again. While its legislative path remains uncertain, the White House is aiming to pass legislation built around Biden's Build Back Better plan ― which could make some of the tax credits and health care subsidies included in Rescue Act permanent, and also include billions in infrastructure spending ― sometime this spring or summer.
The White House, meanwhile, began planning travel. Biden is set to visit Pennsylvania next week to sell the bill, while Vice President Harris will travel to Colorado. Over the next 10 days, the White House plans to highlight different key aspects of the bill, including halving child poverty and boosting rural health care.
If we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt ― that puts profits ahead of the needs of the American people, he said toward the end of a speech about Medicare for All to an audience of cheering supporters in Washington. And that is why today I am calling on every Democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies. Reject that money!
Sanders' transformation is evident in his policy agenda. The inclusion of abortion coverage in his single-payer health care bill won plaudits from women's groups. He commemorated the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination in Memphis, Tennessee; held an anti-poverty rally with civil rights leader Rev. William Barber, in Durham, North Carolina; and convened a live panel discussion on economic inequality that prominently featured people who specialize in the unique barriers facing Americans of color.
Late this week, Trump and GOP leaders agreed to modify the bill by eliminating a requirement that all insurance plans cover essential benefits, such as mental health and maternity care, and then offering special funds to cover the costs of precisely those services. Experts immediately warned that making these changes could dramatically alter health insurance markets, making it difficult to find comprehensive coverage as insurers would gravitate toward offering less generous policies.
When host George Stephanopoulos followed up, asking specifically whether Trump intended to stop enforcing that mandate, Conway responded, he may.
Trump, after all, famously promised during his presidential campaign that he wouldn't touch Medicare or Medicaid. Then he won the election. The GOP is hoping that pattern repeats itself this Election Day.
Trump has said more than once that politically speaking, the easiest choice for Republicans would be to sit back and let the system operate on its own. Doing so, Trump predicted, would lead to a total collapse.
Making it easier to see hospital prices and giving consumers more choices might or might not improve health care access at the margins, but it's not a substitute for the structure the Affordable Care Act has put into place.
Food stamp enrollment in the past quarter has fallen by about half from this time last year, Aguirre said, even with increased outreach and after the center streamlined its application process.
And wouldn't you know it? It's the same crowd that was screaming about the specter of death panels a decade ago.
Over the course of his day-and-a-half in Iowa, Sanders participated in no fewer than four campaign events for J.D. Scholten, who is waging a long-shot bid to unseat infamous white nationalist Rep. Steve King in Iowa's heavily rural 4th Congressional District.
I say to President (Donald) Trump that this country has struggled for too many years, for too many centuries in combating racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia, Sanders declared. We are not going backwards. We are going forwards ― as one people.
Republicans have offered a number of bills intended to show their commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions ― a move designed to blunt Democratic attacks over health care in 2020.
Jayapal continued that she had worked closely with McGovern, who is a Medicare for All advocate himself, and said she was grateful for his leadership.
But conservative Republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. They say the Affordable Care Act violates the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. The Alexander-Collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.
But some researchers at California Food Policy Advocates, a nonprofit based in Oakland, caution against drawing a conclusion between the implementation of the Secure Communities program and the drop-off in food stamp enrollment.
There is also the proposal to eliminate itemized tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable giving. Mnuchin stated that the reasoning behind this move was to eliminate tax loopholes while offsetting the reduction in the base tax rate for Americans in higher income brackets. The problem here is that there are certain taxpayers who are not in the higher tax brackets and may need those itemized deductions in order to lower their tax liability. In the end, they may actually see their federal income tax bill increase and not feel the proposed beneficial effect of Trump's plan.
This is always the problem for Republicans. Making insurance available to everybody typically requires some combination of government spending, taxes and regulations. And these are not things Republicans want to do.
Almost unbelievably, Trump's action on surprise billing is even more fake than his preexisting conditions nonsense. We will end surprise billing, he said. No, they won't.
The South Carolina event, organized by the state chapter of Our Revolution, the group built to carry on the mission of Sanders' 2016 campaign, was billed as a Medicare for all rally. It was Sanders' first trip back to South Carolina since the primary battle in '16.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Cruz.
In general, it was an attempt to shift the race from a referendum on Trump's performance ― a referendum Trump is very likely to fail ― toward a choice between himself and Biden. Trump mentioned Biden's name more than 40 times in his speech Thursday night. Biden never directly mentioned Trump during his speech the week before.
Over the next two weeks I'll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers, Trump crowed at a news conference Friday at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover preexisting conditions.
Rather than replace the ACA and traditional Medicare with something less reliable, as Biden suggests, Sanders' legislation would enroll everyone in an expanded version of Medicare that covers vision and dental care, and no longer costs Americans anything at the point of service.
Heller, for example, is facing a major challenge to his re-election in large part because of his flip-flopping on Affordable Care Act repeal and eventual support for the last version of the legislation to replace it. That bill was the brainchild of Cassidy and Graham and absolutely would have weakened pre-existing condition protections.
James, a 39-year-old West Point graduate who flew Apache helicopters in Iraq, is a rare bright spot in what's been a dismal campaign season for the Republican Party nationally. Trump's chances of winning reelection seem lower every day, and the GOP's 53-47 Senate majority is in jeopardy, with incumbents from even strongly conservative states, including Georgia and South Carolina, suddenly looking vulnerable.
The only thing he could do to piss me off is to stop being Trump, said Innis, arguing that, with an immense sense of brilliance and strategy Trump picked Mike Pence as his vice president precisely for those who wanted political vanilla. If [Trump] isn't that non-nonsense pit bull that he is, then I would be upset. Then I'd be like, 'Ummm. We don't want THAT.'
He's close to Obama and he believes in the same traditional things Obama believed in and that's my number one priority, said Jermaine Edwards, 36, of Orangeburg.
Johnson ultimately prevailed in 1965 against stiff industry resistance to create Medicare for seniors and people with disabilities, Sanders recalled.
I strongly doubt [Trump] understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement. Richard Nephew, former State Department official
At this point, with Biden holding a stable lead and fewer than 70 days until Election Day, Biden wins by not losing.
At 74, Eduardo Lacayo is a retired construction worker from Nicaragua with a permanent green card and two bad knees. He relies on food stamps, but they don't stretch very far, so he hits up the food pantry at the Spanish Catholic Center every week.
It's unclear who decided which experts would testify before the Rules Committee. Staffers on the Rules Committee say no one in leadership directly told them this person or that person couldn't testify, but sources involved with the planning of the hearing say three criteria were applied to potential witnesses: (1) Is this person a leader of a single-payer group? If so, that person could not testify ― meaning Gaffney was out. (2) Is this person an activist? If so, they couldn't testify. That meant people like Dr. Sanjeev Sriram, who has repeatedly advocated for Medicare for All, were ruled out. And (3) Has this person said anything negative about the Affordable Care Act?
But the Republican majority in the Senate isn't interested in pursuing additional emergency relief for those who suddenly find themselves uninsured.
Medicare for All is one proposal. Medicare for All is the best proposal. Is someone going to make that case? Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program
But it has been done before. Health insurance companies have been required to cover people with preexisting conditions ever since the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was enacted 10 years ago.
Health care has become a defining issue of next month's midterm elections, and Republicans across the country, including President Donald Trump, are promising voters that they care deeply about protecting people with pre-existing conditions.
But even with the fierce sniping about Medicare for All, which has become a litmus test in the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, the candidates have yet to explain how any version of the proposal would pass in a sharply divided Senate ― even if Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) finds himself the minority leader once again.
Sanders' September 2017 single-payer health care legislation received the support of about one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus; even former President Barack Obama has praised the underlying policy. And as Sanders is fond of noting on the stump, 70 percent of Americans say they support Medicare for all, according to a Reuters poll in August.
Under the judgment, between 70,500 and 126,400 women could lose access to no-cost birth control, according to government estimates.
But, by that point, the politics of health care in Michigan was shifting in the same way it was shifting nationwide. Voters started to appreciate what the Affordable Care Act, for all of its flaws, had achieved. And they got angry at Republicans for trying to take those things away.
Legal reasoning is always subjective, but even lawyers who enthusiastically supported other lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality have dismissed the case as nonsense.
Many Republicans still aren't willing to vote for any proposal that might appear to prop up Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, which they and many of their supporters would rather just repeal.
Sanders went on to suggest that those who did not reject that money should have to explain why the health care industry sees their candidacy as a good investment.
ASSOCIATED PRESS/Patrick Semansky Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential candidate, speaks about Medicare for All on Wednesday in Washington.
Obama also said future Democrats need to make different policy design decisions. Specifically, he said, they should expect no more cooperation for implementing their reforms than he got for the Affordable Care Act ― although, he warned, without such cooperation, making government programs work is bound to be a lot more difficult:
Steel noted that Biden's assignment of implementing the Recovery Act was an implicit admission that job creation wasn't Obama's top focus.

With so many more patients covered, hospital margins grew and days of cash-on-hand climbed. Such financial improvements enabled the hospital to invest in new projects, including the Pena Family Health Center in southwest Denver. The hospital planned to construct three more clinics, to expand two existing clinics, and to build a new parking garage to drive new revenues and expand its coverage.
There is nothing on the table to mitigate the vast harm that ruling would create, despite assertions from Trump like this: If we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions.
The uncertainty has seeped into the municipal bond market, where nonprofit hospitals access capital. The sector sold 36 percent less debt for new projects so far in 2017, compared to the same period last year, while the rest of the municipal market increased the amount of new money issued by 23 percent, Thomson Reuters data shows. While municipal analysts say it's too early to draw conclusions, the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare is a likely cause for the decline.
But since November's elections, much of those plans have been deferred, including a $24 million expansion of a second clinic, largely financed through bonds. The health system still plans to move forward with the construction of one clinic and the remodeling of another. But those plans could be bigger.
The Latest Blow, And Surely Not The Last One
The GOP votes in 2015, especially in the Senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-Obama, anti-Iran and pro-Israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the Middle East, said Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden's national security adviser.
That fear comes at a price, said co-author Marcella Alsan, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine. For immigrant families struggling to get by, the drop in food stamp use, she said, could have a long-term effect on their health and their mobility out of poverty.
Just 31 percent of Americans approve of the new Alabama anti-abortion law, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. A quarter of Americans who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases disapprove of the law, as do about a third of Republicans, self-described evangelical Christians and self-described conservatives.
I'd like us to put in place a better program than the one we have, the Obamacare program, but getting that in place for the country to take advantage of in the next few weeks is just not very likely, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said.
Our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare is the surest sign that we need someone who will go and work their tail off to remove this monstrosity, James says in the clip, which he recorded while he was seeking the GOP nomination to run against Michigan's other Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow. It was a key issue in his campaign; in an October 2018 debate, James said we took a system that was broken and made it worse.
The campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
(Pressed about the same tweet on Meet the Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (June 10 ranking: 7) tried to attack host Chuck Todd, saying he wanted to discuss health care and asking, your program, a program with the incredible history of 'Meet the Press,' and that's what you want to talk about? When Todd responded by asking why Trump didn't seem to be as devoted to this [health care] as you are, Price offered his own suck-up to his POTUS: He can do more than one thing at a time.)
Republican congressional leaders have essentially given up on repealing Obamacare ― at least in this Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear earlier this year that he has no intention of leading his conference into another fight over the law, despite Trump's vow to turn the GOP into the party of health care. The Kentucky Republican is instead focusing on retaining his majority next year by hammering Democrats over Medicare for All, a government-run health care proposal he says will put the country on a dangerous path to socialism.
Whether Trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. Trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like NATO, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about NATO. In August 2015, Trump told NBC News that he learned military policy from the shows ― television news and interview programs.
I was never really a repeal-and-replace guy. I wanted to fix things, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted to repeal Obamacare in 2017, told HuffPost. Like other Republicans, Perdue views Obamacare as fundamentally broken, calling it a disaster. But he, too, talked up the need to maintain some of its core elements.
Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), meanwhile, said he believes the better approach is relying on more incremental proposals like Medicare at 50, which would allow Americans 50 and older to buy into the Medicare program, to expand the health insurance market.
Here are three more takeaways from the Republican National Convention:
Acting Quickly On The Mandate Could Cause Serious Aftershocks
All of this means the plans come with low premiums. But Monday's announcement means that the less generous plans could become cheaper still ― and thus more attractive ― because states would have authority to redirect financial assistance. Today, the Affordable Care Act's tax credits are available only to people who buy comprehensive coverage.
To make her action even worse, DeVos in her official notification claimed that her delay in enforcing the rule for all schools across the country was in light of Contreras's new decision, even though that decision applied only to a narrow set of appeals pursued by a small group of cosmetology schools.
Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it, take on the NRA and manufacturers, not protect them, stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and not keep the promises, Biden said, taking aim at Sanders' signature plan to move every American to a single government-run health insurance plan and the senator's votes in the early 2000s in favor of protecting gun companies from lawsuits.
Their protests and efforts to make this into a huge deal is as likely to contribute to fear in the immigrant community as anything else, Vaughan said. Then, too, she said, the decline in food stamp enrollment could also be attributed to eligible family members leaving to be with loved ones who were deported.
To get covered, Americans will have to navigate the country's fragmented health care system ― there's the ACA, known as Obamacare, public options like Medicaid, and COBRA, the federal program that lets individuals continue their former employer's health care plan at personal cost. As HuffPost's Jeffrey Young explained, there are barriers to all these options.
Health insurance companies are struggling to make money on the exchanges, leading major players like UnitedHealth Group to openly contemplate abandoning them. Aetna and other firms, in contrast, say they're committed to making the marketplaces work even if they're not immediately profitable. And insurers losing money in the exchange market are eyeing premium increases for next year that could make coverage unaffordable for some portion of those already in the system.
This is actually an argument that Alexander and Collins have sometimes made to their colleagues ― that it's in the GOP's self-interest to find bipartisan agreement on policies to reduce health insurance premiums. It looks like that argument is not carrying the day.
As Sanders was walking out of the facility in shirtsleeves, a student called out to him. Bernie, are you tired yet?
But there was little in the speech that the Trump campaign had not tried before without success.
Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on Iran and other countries in his Fox News appearances. And newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a Kansas congressman in December 2015, told a Westminster Institute audience that the only real solution in Iran was the abolition of the current regime.
'Oh, everything is great, I expected to eat my grandma miles ago, now excuse me I've got to go salt my cousin,' Colbert added.
Without the stepped-up immigration enforcement of Secure Communities, Alsan and Yang estimate that ACA enrollment among Latino immigrants would be 22 percent higher.
Last month, consumer and patient advocates launched a lawsuit of their own, arguing that some of the Trump administration's rule changes violate the Affordable Care Act's coverage guarantees. It's not clear whether the changes the administration announced Monday will provoke similar lawsuits, or how vulnerable the rule change could be.
We can't even pay for Medicare for some. We need to solidify that. We need to fix the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Tuesday when asked about Medicare for All.
Voters' support for abortion rights is at a record high, said Cecile Richards, the former head of Planned Parenthood who recently co-founded Supermajority, a group devoted to women's political power. Meanwhile, we're seeing the most extreme attacks on those rights since Roe v. Wade more than 40 years ago. .... Women are voting in record numbers, donating in record numbers, sharing their stories, and organizing. Women are becoming the most powerful political force in America, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020.
In the end, exit polls found 89% of 2010 midterm voters said the economy was in bad shape, and 41% said their family's financial situation was worse than it had been two years ago, compared to just 14% who said their financial situation had improved. Republicans gained six seats in the Senate and took control of the House, picking up a whopping 63 seats.
This article also appears on Republic Report.
The [Democratic] Party is pushing a socialist nightmare. Their plans will result in rationing care, denying choice, putting Americans on waitlist, driving the best doctors out of medicine permanently and delaying cures, Trump said.
In an effort to regain his footing, Sanders has sought to emphasize to voters that while other candidates, including Warren and Harris, have adopted signature policies like Medicare for All, the integrity with which he would fight for them is unrivaled.
And what is the Republican solution? Cutting Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, of course!
This issue is essentially a health care issue, said Kim Baker, a co-chair with Indivisible Midlands (SC2), which is also fighting at the state level to stop the legislature from restricting abortion rights. Then you bring in the extra attacks on women's autonomy and reproductive rights, and I think it will be a very big issue going into the 2020 elections.
What editor thought it would be a good idea to include a photo of a white doctor helping a sullen black patient (obviously a beneficiary of Obamacare and probably some other wasteful Democrat subsidies or entitlement programs) in this article???
But it is not just differences over reproductive rights that are standing in the way of passage.
In theory, even the conservatives justices should make quick work of the case.
Levitt called the regulatory change a major end run around the health law.
To put an extra head spin on the whole incident, Trump's Department of Justice argued before the Supreme Court in June to shut down the ACA with its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. It even specifically singled out coverage for preexisting conditions as something that's got to go.
The capital gains tax would be reduced from 23.8 to 20 percent. This reduction comes from the elimination of the 3.8 percent tax that helps fund Obamacare applying to investment income over $250,000 for a married couple. This cut is to incentivize investors for increasing investments while minimizing the after-tax liability. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hopes to greatly encourage investments and, in the long and short-term, stimulate economic growth.

Sanders' rivals in the Democratic primary are already in compliance with key elements of his pledge. All 24 Democratic candidates have rejected corporate PAC money of all kinds; 14 of them, including the leaders in the polls, have also renounced contributions from federal lobbyists.
Last year, Trump triumphantly signed a huge tax cut bill. The GOP line when this legislation was going through Congress was that it would pay for itself. It did not. It predictably blew a giant hole in the budget and increased the deficit.
For instance, as the law steamed toward final passage on Wednesday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee ― which is partially under McConnell's control ― pressured Democratic Senate candidates on whether transgender women should be eligible to play sports, not on whether they supported the COVID-19 relief bill.
But that was in the 1960s. Today we are in 2019, Sanders concluded. In my view, now is the time, not for tinkering around the edges ... Now is the time to do what the American people want us to do, now is the time to pass a Medicare for All, single-payer program.
You can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass, Obama said. And that can't be how any democracy functions over time. If you ask me what has contributed to the cynicism ― of government, and to some degree what contributed to the cynicism around the health care initiative ― it's the fact that a small minority of people can put a halt to everything.
That fear comes at a price, said co-author Marcella Alsan, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine. For immigrant families struggling to get by, the drop in food stamp use, she said, could have a long-term effect on their health and their mobility out of poverty.
The Iran deal is a terrible deal. We paid $150 billion. We gave $1.8 billion in cash. That's actual cash, barrels of cash. It's insane. It's ridiculous. It should have never been made, Trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.
Now there's a new debate, about the effect of COVID-19 on public health and the economy ― and how to respond.
The campaign of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she already rejects the contributions of pharmaceutical executives, but likewise did not specify whether she would bar health insurance executives from doing so as well.
I think the important thing is that people have a choice in their selection of a plan, added Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
Abortion could take the same route in the next election cycle.
What we have found is not that people are so crazy about Joe Biden. It's that they really love President Obama, King said.
Amid those lies, however, GOP officials and candidates have occasionally lapsed and told the truth: The party, like it always has, wants to cut federal health care programs. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, still without having any idea how to replace it, and they're working hard to make the law worse in the meantime. They want to slash Medicaid. They want to shrink Medicare.
Death Panels In The Age Of Obamacare
There's great demand that we're concerned about not being able to meet in the future, said Burnette.
More moderate members, many of them from Democratic-leaning states and states that used Affordable Care Act money to expand Medicaid, worried that the bill would take away insurance coverage from too many people ― and that, if premiums really did come down, they would do so only by increasing out-of-pocket costs for people who held on to their coverage.
Joel McElvain, outgoing assistant director of the federal programs branch, has spent more than 20 years at the department, much of it working on the biggest cases of the day. A former colleague described McElvain to HuffPost as a really good guy — the type who in any rational or just world would be at DOJ his entire career.
Asked to clarify her position on Obamacare last week, McSally told HuffPost she believed the way Obamacare did it was not the way to do it. However, she quickly acknowledged the changed politics surrounding the law and its impact on the country's health care system, arguing it ought to be fixed rather than repealed outright.
Not that the Affordable Care Act's architects thought they were fixing all of the health care system's problems. After nearly a century of failed attempts at passing universal coverage, most recently during Bill Clinton's presidency, Democrats were determined to find a more politically viable path. By around 2006 or so, a consensus had taken shape around a plan that leaned heavily on private insurance and minimized disruption of existing arrangements, and a strategy that stressed negotiating with the health care industry rather than fighting it.
WASHINGTON ― Democrats are gearing up to turn abortion into a key issue for the 2020 elections, saying it could turn out to be an issue that mirrors the fight to preserve the Affordable Care Act in 2018.
It's always exciting when national figures localize our issues, he added.
McElvain was one of those career Justice lawyers who withdrew from the case. And now he has decided to leave the department entirely.
I think that the enrollment period should have been reopened, Collins said in the interview. One of the reasons that I pushed the paycheck protection program so hard is that if we can keep people on their regular payroll, many more people will continue to receive their health insurance.
The rally was the product of a longstanding invitation from the state's Our Revolution chapter, according to his staff, which did not comment on the absence of the various candidates.
And on top of everything else, Republicans were fighting an increasingly skeptical public. Multiple polls have suggested the GOP measure is deeply unpopular, while the law it aimed to replace, long the subject of controversy and the object of scorn among conservatives, is now becoming more popular.
Ben Marter, a spokesman for Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), noted that Trump had called the Post and the Times today to discuss health care reform defeats, but not us.
(Pressed about the same tweet on Meet the Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (June 10 ranking: 7) tried to attack host Chuck Todd, saying he wanted to discuss health care and asking, your program, a program with the incredible history of 'Meet the Press,' and that's what you want to talk about? When Todd responded by asking why Trump didn't seem to be as devoted to this [health care] as you are, Price offered his own suck-up to his POTUS: He can do more than one thing at a time.)

Sanders campaigned for Scholten after Scholten reached out to him, according to Sanders' staff, which did not comment on Finkenauer or Axne.
During his 40-minute remarks in South Carolina and in three speeches in Iowa later on Saturday and on Sunday in Iowa, Sanders did little to conceal that he is strongly considering another presidential run. He spent a good chunk of his time recounting how the policies he championed as a presidential candidate are now squarely in the Democratic mainstream.
Another ad similarly paints Biden's election as simply a part of the solution rather than a revolutionary act. Our generation deserves better, and Joe Biden can help us get there, the ad's narrator says. We know the fight for progress won't stop after Election Day, but there are enough of us to start making progress again.
As millions of Americans slip into unemployment and lose their health insurance during a public health crisis, Senate Republicans still see no need to act on health care.
When host George Stephanopoulos followed up, asking specifically whether Trump intended to stop enforcing that mandate, Conway responded, he may.

Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, said she was worried about the uncertainty created by the ruling.
They succeeded. The Affordable Care Act, for all of its inadequacies and flaws, helped tens of millions of those Americans get care. A big reason Republican efforts to repeal the law failed was that it would have rolled back this progress.
The rally was the product of a longstanding invitation from the state's Our Revolution chapter, according to his staff, which did not comment on the absence of the various candidates.
If the Supreme Court strikes down the law, those protections disappear. But such a ruling would do much more.
Of course, he may is not the same as he will. And Trump's executive order didn't change policy or otherwise commit the administration to a course of action. It was simply a statement of intent. The president and his deputies are under no obligation to follow through.
Over the course of his day-and-a-half in Iowa, Sanders participated in no fewer than four campaign events for J.D. Scholten, who is waging a long-shot bid to unseat infamous white nationalist Rep. Steve King in Iowa's heavily rural 4th Congressional District.
Moreover, the progress in growing the exchanges and in covering the uninsured may be stalling. Total enrollment on the exchanges barely grew compared to last year, and those who remain uninsured are considered the most difficult to locate and persuade. That's especially true for households that earn too much to qualify for health insurance subsidies.
HuffPost asked a number of the leading presidential campaigns whether they were prepared to reject contributions over $200 from executives in the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. The campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a fellow proponent of Medicare for All, said it would do so.
Many insurers suffered significant financial losses during the first few years of the program, because they attracted fewer healthier customers than they anticipated. This year, those carriers responded with larger-than-usual premium increases and, in some places, by withdrawing offerings altogether.
Taxes were a key item in Donald Trump's presidential agenda. He and his advisors feel that revision of the nation's tax code will spur economic growth and, besides changing healthcare policy, be a hallmark of his presidency. However, his proposed tax policy will benefit businesses and the wealthy, while hurting the middle class, the poor, and ballooning the federal budget deficit and the national debt.
The timing seemed fortuitous because it was right before the 10-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act's signing, a milestone he planned to mark by attending a conference and celebration at American University nearby. Then the pandemic hit, forcing it to be canceled, which felt somehow appropriate given that the law continues to inspire mixed feelings. Approval of the program is higher than in the past, according to polls, but it's still lower than cherished programs like Medicare and Social Security.

You can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass. And that can't be how any democracy functions over time.

We didn't adequately explain what we had done, Biden said during a conversation with House Democrats last week, reflecting on the passage of the 2009 law. Barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a 'victory lap.' I kept saying, 'Tell people what we did.' He said, 'We don't have time. I'm not going to take a victory lap.' And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.
Speculation in November and early December, captured in national headlines, questioned the strength of Biden's frontrunner status in South Carolina, but the most recent survey showed him with a comfortable lead. The Fox News poll conducted in early January showed him 21 percentage points ahead of runners-up billionaire Tom Steyer, who has been investing heavily in the South Carolina primary. Close behind Steyer were Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
A top White House adviser said Sunday that the Trump administration may use its executive authority to weaken or effectively eliminate Obamacare's individual mandate.
If the Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, then join us, the former vice president said to roaring applause.
One of the most striking things about the final night of the Republican National Convention was the degree to which speakers singled out New York City as an embodiment of the failures of urban Democratic rule.
Graham said it would be a nice gesture for Ivanka & Jared to attend, but cleared it w/ Cindy McCain first, Rogers tweeted, referring to McCain's widow.
But McCaughey's claim fit the broader narrative about health care reform that the right was constructing ― namely, that the proposed legislation would limit care for the medically vulnerable. Soon Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate, made her own version of the argument.
But the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions Republican leaders have attached to any Affordable Care Act stabilization proposal. And by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.
Next week the Rules Committee will be holding an historic hearing on #MedicareForAll, & Dr. Nahvi is one of our expert witnesses.

Worse still, his South Carolina defeat epitomized the difficulty he had attracting support from black voters, a core constituency for the Democratic Party.
Declines in SNAP and ACA enrollment were largest in mixed status households where some people are in the country legally and some are not, the study found. For example, one family member may be a citizen, another an asylee or a permanent resident, and still another undocumented.
Whether the upsides of the Alexander-Collins package justify its downsides has been the subject of increasingly intense debate among Democrats and progressive analysts in the last few weeks. Families USA, a liberal organization and prominent advocate for coverage expansions, actually came out in opposition to the bill.
It's word of mouth, whatever their friends tell them, they take it as, 'It's going to happen to me,' Delcid said. And a lot of them are saying, 'Don't apply for benefits, you'll get deported.' We try to explain to them, 'That's not how it works.' But they just don't want to renew their benefits any more. They want them to expire.
In response, James has adopted a strategy Republicans around the country have used. In a widely circulating television advertisement and in interviews with local journalists, James has cited a family member's medical problems ― specifically, his son's asthma ― as proof that he would always look out for people with preexisting conditions.
You sound like the most optimistic guy in the Donner Party, said Colbert, referencing the pioneers who reportedly resorted to cannibalism after they were stranded in the Sierra Nevada in the winter of 1846/47.
I think it's been an interesting idea to generate conversation about how we best provide health care to people, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said on Tuesday when asked if she could support a version of Medicare for All. I'm interested in doing everything we can as quickly as possible to give as many people access to health care as we can, and I don't think that will do it ... I think there are other ways to cover people faster.
Many of these people remember, angrily, the promise from President Barack Obama that they could keep their old plans if they liked them. And in states like Iowa, which have some of the highest rates for unsubsidized customers, GOP state officials have been among the most aggressive in seeking ways to weaken or eliminate the Affordable Care Act's rules.
In 1994, she claimed that Hillary Clinton's health care reform plan would bar people from purchasing care outside the new Clinton system, which would cruelly ration treatments to curb costs. It wasn't true. The magazine that published the article would later disavow it.
What criteria did Aetna use in determining the states from which to withdraw in 2016?
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said first lady Melania Trump attended the service. She did not.
It was a difficult undertaking, he said. What they succeeded and what they did has improved the lives and saved the lives of countless, countless people.
It was enough to pique the interest of Pelzer, the voter unswayed by the Biden-Obama connection.
The Alabama law, in particular, was a wake-up call for many people. It goes further even than what some Republicans and abortion opponents support, because it doesn't have the rape and incest exceptions.
As part of the promotional campaign for Obama's visit to Milwaukee, the White House shared a letter a former opponent sent the president about his experience with the Affordable Care Act.
Wednesday's decision sent the case back to a lower court. Further attempts to block the Trump rules may soon follow.
And in an interview with WZZM-TV, the ABC affiliate in Grand Rapids, James said, I understand firsthand how important it is to protect our family members and people with preexisting conditions. … I will not support any plan that pulls the rug out from under people.
Many more Americans would lose Medicaid coverage because all but a dozen states have expanded eligibility to include everybody living below or just above the poverty line, providing coverage that's federally funded. That federal funding comes from the Affordable Care Act, and it, too, would stop if the law is no longer in effect.
Both national conventions had their emotional, viral moments ― Brayden Harrington's speech about his stutter at the Democratic National Convention, widow Ann Dorn's tribute to her retired police officer husband at the GOP celebration ― but neither had any type of game-changing moment to alter the fundamental story of the race: It is a referendum on President Donald Trump, with many voters disapproving of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, health care and racial justice. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has a steady but not overwhelming lead in polls of the most crucial swing states.
But this latest regulatory change is a reminder that the GOP has never given up on its goal of wiping Obamacare off the books, and that people with serious medical problems are likely to suffer as a result.
Like stimulus ― what does that even mean to people? Psaki said, reflecting on how Democrats sold the 2009 bill.
But a minority of consumers must pay full premiums, because their household incomes are more than four times the poverty line. (That's about $100,000 for a family of four.) And in some parts of the country, like Iowa and Tennessee, premiums have skyrocketed ― partly because of design flaws in the 2010 health care law, and partly because of Republican efforts to undermine its implementation.
The public still holds largely partisan views on the health reform law, and opinions have remained relatively unchanged since the Republican efforts to repeal it. But according to recent Democratic polling, the electorate still prefers Congressional Democrats' approach to the issue over congressional Republicans' approach by a double-digit margin.
Pelosi herself has repeatedly refused to endorse a Medicare for All approach to health care, insisting instead that the best way forward is to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act. And even though the single-payer advocates we spoke to this week emphasized the importance of this hearing, there's wariness that the meeting could end up supporting Pelosi's position.
Correction: A previous version of this article said the House Rules Committee had not yet released the names of all the witnesses for the hearing, but it has.
Now its control of the Senate in doubt, and the Affordable Care Act is a top issue again, thanks in part to a new lawsuit challenging its constitutionality that the Supreme Court is expected to hear in November ― quite possibly, with Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett in the seat that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg once occupied.
And in June, he introduced legislation eliminating the use of cash bail, which a press release from his office noted disproportionately affects black, Latinx and Native American people.
Trump wants to get rid of that Obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of Americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health care, she said on ABC's This Week.
Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it, take on the NRA and manufacturers, not protect them, stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and not keep the promises, Biden said, taking aim at Sanders' signature plan to move every American to a single government-run health insurance plan and the senator's votes in the early 2000s in favor of protecting gun companies from lawsuits.
Corlette noted that the Obama administration insisted that state waivers not hurt certain vulnerable populations, including those with severe medical needs. This is saying that so long as things work out in the aggregate, then it's OK if certain subpopulations are harmed, she said.
Without the mandate or some other policy device to keep healthy people buying coverage, most experts say insurers would have to charge everybody else even more ― and, partly as a consequence, fewer people would end up having insurance.
Why GOP Leaders Couldn't Get The Votes
But a severe economic downturn was inevitable because people scared of the virus aren't going to engage in commercial activity like they did before. The actual choice policymakers face is whether or not to have the government provide for the population during this crisis ― by guaranteeing that people have money, food, housing and health insurance.
Primus also did himself no favors in a March 25 meeting with staff from a number of congressional committees that have health care jurisdiction. He reportedly said the Medicare for All hearing was a check the box and move on type of thing.
We came really close today, but we came up short, Ryan said at a press conference. This is a disappointing day for us.
An April 2017 bill to make $15 the federal minimum wage, which once had paltry support from his colleagues, now enjoys majority support within the Senate's Democratic ranks. And most recently, Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) successfully pressured Amazon into adopting a $15 minimum wage.
During his first year in office, Trump's top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But in the past two months, Trump has fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leaving Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.
At issue in Trump v. Pennsylvania, consolidated with Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, were new rules established by the Trump administration that vastly expanded the types of organizations that could opt out of the mandate based on religious beliefs or moral objections.
If campaign season starts up in 2020 and there is no bricks in the [Mexico] wall, I would have to say, at that point, 'O.K., what's going on? Edward eventually conceded.
If you're caught in an insurance trap, where COBRA is too expensive, you live in a state that didn't expand Medicaid, and aren't eligible for subsidized private insurance through Obamacare, what happens when you need to go to the ER, Miller asked rhetorically: You lose your labor market income and you can potentially face some financial hits if you need necessary medical care — you go to the ER — that can have an impact on your credit score.
The law's likely overhaul puts many hospitals in a uniquely daunting position of being unable to predict how many of their patients will be insured and what type of coverage they will have in the future. As a result, many are more wary than in years past to invest in expensive capital projects, issue debt, or expand into new regions, said healthcare experts and hospital executives.
A super PAC funded by one of the Democratic Party's largest donors is reserving $11 million worth of digital advertising space targeting young voters, hoping that simply pointing them to the basic policy differences between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump will increase their enthusiasm to vote in November.
The Affordable Care Act has its shortcomings and tradeoffs. Nobody, not even its staunchest defenders, think it's the ideal response to the problems of America's health care system.
If we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the American people, we have got to confront a Washington culture that is corrupt ― that puts profits ahead of the needs of the American people, he said toward the end of a speech about Medicare for All to an audience of cheering supporters in Washington. And that is why today I am calling on every Democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies. Reject that money!
The Iran deal is just one instance where Trump's not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.
For the first time in history, a congressional committee will be hearing from experts on why every American should have access to quality, affordable healthcare, sponsor of the Medicare for All legislation Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement. This hearing will continue the momentum for this deeply important issue ― an issue that people have literally been dying over while waiting for Congress to resolve ― and will surely be a catalyst for more action to come.
Biden didn't name Sanders in his victory speech. But it was clear he was talking about the senator, who has surpassed Biden in national polls. Sanders is also poised to win big on Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates deciding the Democratic nomination will be up for grabs.
The mandate is meant to encourage healthy people to buy insurance. It makes it possible for insurers to sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and not worry that people will wait until getting sick to enroll. The mandate also makes sure that people without coverage assume some financial responsibility for the charity care they would receive if they needed it.
Our conversation took place in early March 2020, well before anyone knew Joe Biden would win the nomination and become president this year, or that Democrats would also have full control of Congress, or that the overwhelming political priority would be dealing with COVID-19. And strictly speaking, the interview with Obama wasn't about how Democrats should govern. The subject was the Affordable Care Act, for a new book about the law's history that is coming out on Tuesday.
And people who want or need comprehensive insurance ― say, because they have diabetes or are cancer survivors ― are likely to have a harder time getting such coverage, because of how the markets will change.
I think what we got wrong was underestimating ... the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled. Former President Barack Obama
Republic Report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of President Donald J. Trump. Trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.
Again this week, we have almost no idea what Bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. Whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot.
Republicans have been very busy lying about health care: lying about their policy agenda, lying about Democrats calling them liars and lying about who said who was really lying about all this.
But if you remember the promise, you may also remember how empty it was.
Biden ended his speech with one more poignant attack on Sanders' lifelong position as an Independent in Congress, and as a democratic socialist who has been critical of the Democratic Party.
Thanks to President Biden and Democrats, help is on the way, a narrator declares in the ad.
While it seems that every candidate — including President Trump — is vowing these days to protect people with preexisting conditions, you can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true, Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote recently.
And then on Sunday, Conway got a little more specific.
Trump wants to get rid of that Obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of Americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health care, she said on ABC's This Week.
The goal of the advertising is to remind liberal-leaning young people that one of the two old men vying for the presidency agrees with them on the issues a lot more than the other does. One of NextGen's first ads is design to rebut the idea that there is little difference between Biden and Trump, comparing and contrasting Biden's pledge to expand health care coverage with Trump's support for repealing Obamacare; and Biden's support for clean energy with Trump's backing of unchecked pollution, among other issues.
The Iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based Republican Party, which no longer exists, Tyler said. Trump's supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way. It's basically: 'Whatever Trump says goes, and that's fine with us.'
This is by far one of the worst pieces of legislation I've seen in the Senate, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday. The American people need to learn more about what's in it.
Shortly after Cotton's speech on Thursday, the Biden campaign sent out an email blast to reporters with the subject line: Donald Trump Is the Weakest President in U.S. History When It Comes to China – and Chinese Officials Are Pulling for His Re-election. The attack memo highlights, among other things, Trump's initial reluctance to criticize China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak, his calls for the Chinese government to investigate the Bidens to benefit him politically and Trump's inaccurate claim that he banned travel to the U.S. from China in order to contain COVID-19.
In his speech at the church, Biden told a story he would repeat throughout the holiday weekend: that not too long ago a Black man picked him up at the train station in Wilmington, Delaware, and took him to the steps of the Capitol in Washington to be inaugurated as the vice president of the United States. That man, of course, was Barack Obama.
Still, after HuffPost asked those questions about a potential lack of Medicare for All voices on the panel, the Rules Committee tweeted the video of Nahvi making the case for single-payer health care.
I think that the enrollment period should have been reopened, Collins said in the interview. One of the reasons that I pushed the paycheck protection program so hard is that if we can keep people on their regular payroll, many more people will continue to receive their health insurance.
John has always said that if we repeal the ACA, there must be a replacement in place that protects people with preexisting conditions, campaign spokesperson Abby Walls told HuffPost.
We have a legacy system that is one-sixth of the economy, Obama said. The idea that you could, in some way, dismantle that entire system ― or even transition it entirely ― to a single payer system looked politically impractical and probably really disruptive. ... The best chance to actually get people healthier was going to be to design a system that acknowledged 85% of the American people have health insurance and that plugged the gap for those 15% who don't.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates there are 5.7 million people who are not eligible for financial subsidies under Obamacare, and who would have to pay for the entirety of their private insurance plan. COBRA too is cost-prohibitive for many families. The average monthly cost for individual coverage in an employer-sponsored plan is $490, amounting to nearly $6,000 a year — a steep cost for someone without an income.
I'm more worried than I have been since it was originally [put in place], said Gail Kaplan-Wassell, a Maryland resident who came to the Supreme Court Tuesday to join a protest in favor of reproductive rights. Kaplan-Wassell said that as a college student in Massachusetts in the 1970s, she had also come to the National Mall to advocate for abortion rights.
Obama traveled to Milwaukee because the city bested other locations in a challenge to sign up the most people in the enrollment period that recently ended. Close to 13 million enrolled in private coverage via the Obamacare health insurance exchanges this year.
Cities that didn't cooperate with Secure Communities didn't see the same declines.
Instead of blaming President Obama and the Democrats or thinking that misplaced risks and inaccurate enrollment predictions are the problem, maybe some of those CEOs earning $10-$15 million dollars per year should stop whining about not making enough profits and start finding ways to help fellow human beings survive and thrive... maybe even human beings who aren't white.
That includes requirements affecting which benefits insurance plans cover, as well as requirements on who gets financial assistance and how much, and how the people choosing insurance can use that assistance.
To make matters more disgraceful, DeVos justified her harmful decision with a gross misstatement. Gainful Employment regulations, she said in a press release, have been repeatedly challenged by educational institutions and overturned by the courts. DeVos was right that the rules had been challenged over and over by schools ― many of them the predatory schools that risked losing their federal aid under the rules if they didn't shape up and stop deceiving, overcharging, and under-educating students. But her characterization of what the courts had done with the rule was false.
Ip writes, So how can the ACA be fixed? Democrats' solution is, essentially, more subsidies. Mr. Obama has called for a public option, a federal health plan to supplement private insurers. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, goes even further: She wants anyone over 55 to be able to opt into Medicare. Both would nudge the U.S. closer to a 'single payer' model like Canada's that liberal activists have long sought. Yet this would require a lot more money and further erode market forces in health care. (FYI, just as family values is Republican code for anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage, Canada is Republican code for socialism.)
The ultimate futility of courting Republicans — so memorable today — is one of many grievances more progressive Democrats still hold over Obama's handling of the health care law. And in the popular imagination, it is the main reason Obama made so many key compromises, like dropping a public option — the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would offer a more efficient, more patient-friendly alternative to private insurance.
That's why both health care plans put forward by Biden and Harris leave some form of a private insurance system largely in place. Sanders, meanwhile, has no qualms about eliminating the private insurance system altogether. He argues that not doing so would leave too many Americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers while driving up costs for everybody.
And it appears that some of the Justice Department's own career lawyers feel the same way. Right before the Trump administration filed its brief, siding with the conservative states, three career lawyers who were supposed to file it withdrew their names from the case, offering an early hint that something was amiss.
Despite the invite, the Twitterverse was quick to note the irony of Ivanka and Jared's presence, especially in the face of speakers' not-so-subtle digs at the president.
One thing that Sanders clearly does not see as an obstacle is his age. Though that issue would likely surface, its importance could be diminished if the 75-year-old Biden enters the race. And by Election Day in 2020, Trump will be 74.
That last requirement, implemented by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's top health care staffer, Wendell Primus, according to sources, is particularly an issue for some single-payer advocates, because they believe the hearing could turn into an exercise in which witnesses seem to endorse all sorts of different approaches to health care ― the ACA, a Medicare buy-in situation, and perhaps, maybe, Medicare for All.
His return-to-greatness vision came as he and the Fox panel blasted Obamacare as a freebie for those who don't want to work. Obamacare isn't free, and recipients pay premiums.
The end of Christie's term in office can't come quick enough for the people of New Jersey, who currently give the governor a 15 percent approval rating. Christie could quickly replace hapless Reince Priebus (June 15 ranking: 10) as White House chief of staff, assuming Priebus is tired of the humiliation at Trump's hands, and Christie is tanned, rested, and ready for more humiliation at Trump's hands.
It's almost impossible to wrap your brain around how this would actually work, Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University, told HuffPost. It's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not.
It is indeed true that Biden voted to approve permanent normalized trade relations with China in 2000. Experts estimate that from 1999 to 2011, the U.S. lost between 2 million and 2.4 million manufacturing jobs due to increased competition with China. As a candidate, Sanders also slammed Biden for his vote to open up U.S.-China trade.
I just think there's a higher, higher level of awareness of how multiple things in this bill can impact their lives, said John Anzalone, who polled for Biden's presidential campaign. They're going to remember how this sped up distribution of the vaccine and expedited getting kids back in school.
To be sure, such attitudes aren't persuasive for everyone.
The policy of the United States is an empty phrase. It's not a law. It's not even an actual policy. Also, the current real policy of the United States on this issue is encoded in a law called the Affordable Care Act that Trump is trying to get rid of.
Brendan McDermid/Reuters Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), right, criticized Joe Biden for signing off on trade deals that cost the U.S. manufacturing jobs. Trump is attacking Biden's trade record as well.
Yes, insurance companies wouldn't be allowed to refuse to offer coverage to someone who, for example, has a history of cancer or is pregnant. But they could sell someone a policy that doesn't cover cancer treatments or the birth of a child.
All of this means the plans come with low premiums. But Monday's announcement means that the less generous plans could become cheaper still ― and thus more attractive ― because states would have authority to redirect financial assistance. Today, the Affordable Care Act's tax credits are available only to people who buy comprehensive coverage.
Shutting down the law would mean shutting down the center and its programs, with unknown consequences for the health care providers participating in them.
But the weakest argument, the one that has prompted so many of the law's critics to dismiss it, is about a concept called severability. Under a well-established doctrine, judges ruling part of a law unconstitutional are supposed to do minimal damage to the rest of the law if they can.
In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security started a partnership, the Secure Communities program, that cross-checked the fingerprints of people arrested at the local level with the agency's database of deportable individuals. The program ran until 2014, and was reinstated last year. It resulted in the deportation of more than 363,000 immigrants charged with crimes.

In a call to arms designed to further affirm his populist credentials and distinguish himself in a crowded primary field, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) committed on Wednesday to reject contributions of $200 or more from executives at the country's pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, as well as the political action committees and lobbyists who represent them.
One thing is certain, he said: SNAP is the nation's first line of defense against hunger.
Al Diaz/Miami Herald via Getty Images Donald Trump named a woman to his economic advisory team who has repeatedly lied about public policy proposals.
Having announced last month that she would launch a lengthy process to rewrite the rules developed under President Obama to hold predatory for-profit colleges accountable for ripping off students and taxpayers, Secretary DeVos announced online at 4:20 pm Friday before the holiday weekend that she was delaying key parts of one of the rules, called gainful employment. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) charged, appropriately, that the move would give predatory for-profit schools more time to take advantage of students, bilk taxpayers, and hide information about perpetually poor-performing programs from the public.
Harris has repeatedly backtracked on whether she supports the most controversial elements of Sanders' plan: forcing Americans off of their private insurance and into the expanded Medicare program; and raising middle class taxes to finance the new program.
It's a complicated set of changes, but it means that some residents of states seeking the waivers could end up with easier access to cheaper, skimpier health plans, providing an alternative to those who cannot afford to pay for comprehensive coverage that the Affordable Care Act has made available.
Levitt called the regulatory change a major end run around the health law.
WASHINGTON ― In 2017, now-Arizona Sen. Martha McSally really, really wanted to repeal Obamacare. McSally, then a congresswoman, reportedly stood up in the middle of a GOP conference meeting and urged her colleagues to vote for a bill to gut the signature Democratic domestic policy achievement of the past decade, telling them to get this fucking thing done.
Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act is actually functioning without a mandate penalty. That's one more reason to preserve the law, as a separate friend-of-the-court brief from several dozen policy experts argues.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during the National Urban League Conference, Friday, July 26, 2019, in Indianapolis.
But in Iowa last month, conservative Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds resisted calls to shut down plants with severe coronavirus outbreaks. Patience Roggensack, the conservative chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, questioned the state's shutdown order because the big spike in illness was among meatpacking workers (often immigrants), and not and the regular folks.
The same can be said about when to not attend a party. I don't know if it was gall or insouciance but Jared and Ivanka's presence was wrong and troubling.#McCainFuneral — Martine St-Victor (@MartineMontreal) September 1, 2018
Another Orangeburg resident, Mary Hampton, 58, said that she can trust Biden for standing strong with Obama.
McGovern also noted in his statement that he worked with Jayapal and staff from the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to help plan the hearing. I am a cosponsor of this bill and I'm proud to convene the first-ever hearing on Medicare for All as Congress works toward universal coverage, McGovern said.
It's also not a substitute for the hundreds of billions of dollars that the Affordable Care Act spends every year on private insurance subsidies and expanded Medicaid ― which, in turn, has improved financial security, access to care and health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders.
It is indeed true that Biden voted to approve permanent normalized trade relations with China in 2000. Experts estimate that from 1999 to 2011, the U.S. lost between 2 million and 2.4 million manufacturing jobs due to increased competition with China. As a candidate, Sanders also slammed Biden for his vote to open up U.S.-China trade.
While Republicans claim they want the law to protect both people with pre-existing conditions and people who rely on government programs for health coverage, those ideas are ideologically at odds with fundamental tenets of American conservatism. Lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller federal government are incompatible with a safety net worth its name.
The defendant in the case is the U.S. government, because the Affordable Care Act is a federal law. Customarily, the Justice Department would file a brief arguing why the states are wrong, since it is part of the executive branch and defending federal statutes in court is part of the executive's constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
The National Bureau of Economic Research study found that in the decade before Donald Trump took office, there might have been a correlation between deportation fears and the drop-off in the number of Latino immigrants enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as food stamps, and the Affordable Care Act insurance program, also known as Obamacare.
Surprised? Don't be. Gingrich's plan to let traditional Medicare wither on the vine, as he put in 1996, is more than 20 years old. Ryan may be retiring from Congress after the upcoming election, but his 2012 plan (and the various versions of it created since then) to slash Medicare and replace it with a voucher system remains popular among fellow GOP politicians, even though they tend to hide this during election years. Or even straight-up lie about it.
Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, said she was worried about the uncertainty created by the ruling.

I'll be curious to see how the lawyers try to square Trump signing this executive order while simultaneously arguing before the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act's protections for pre-existing conditions be annihilated. — Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) August 8, 2020
ASSOCIATED PRESS Joe Biden's strategy for winning the Democratic presidential nomination hinges in part on a convincing win in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. Here, he campaigns at an oyster roast event on Sunday in Orangeburg, S.C.
Over the next two weeks I'll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers, Trump crowed at a news conference Friday at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover preexisting conditions.
CPAC has never been ideal turf for Trump. Though the gathering helped legitimize him among conservatives when he first appeared in 2011, he skipped the conference in 2016, out of fear that the crowd would walk out of his speech in protest. His address on Friday sparked no such act of defiance. It was, instead, a fairly well received, if not meandering, attack on the press, and a review of campaign promises.
An answer Barrett gave at her confirmation hearing, when the issue of the Affordable Care Act came up repeatedly, suggests that she too has a traditional view on severability.
Gaffney was actually one of the witnesses that single-payer advocates put forward to testify. But the Rules Committee nixed his appearance, along with those of more than a dozen other suggested witnesses.
There is nothing on the table to mitigate the vast harm that ruling would create, despite assertions from Trump like this: If we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions.
At the same time, the administration is loosening regulations on certain types of health insurance policies to allow insurers to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions. That's part of Trump's ongoing campaign to sabotage the Affordable Care Act's health insurance markets.
Immigrants must have lived legally in the United States for five years to be eligible to receive SNAP benefits. A few other immigrant groups — refugees, asylees and the elderly — also are eligible to receive food stamps. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible, although many of them work and pay taxes. Immigrants living in the United States are twice as likely as U.S. citizens to be poor, despite working at the same rate.
NextGen America, which is funded by former presidential candidate and billionaire investor Tom Steyer, will officially endorse Biden on Wednesday and has reserved the digital ad buy to reach voters younger than 35. The group's decision to back Biden isn't surprising; it had already announced plans to spend more than $40 million targeting Trump and key Republican-held Senate seats this year.
It's gotta be replaced, Tillis said of Obamacare last week, before brushing off the coming onslaught of health care ads against him in 2020. The North Carolina Republican warned Democrats and their allies planning on taking him on that they would do so at their own peril because the fact of the matter is the Affordable Care Act is not popular.
Donald Trump made a key promise during his presidential campaign to revise the nation's tax code while lowering taxes. However, upon closer examination of his recently released tax proposal, certain groups will benefit, while others may suffer economic harm.
We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats, Trump explained. With no Democrats on board, we couldn't quite get there.
This was six weeks ago. Is @realDonaldTrump going to instruct the Solicitor General to withdraw this brief and file a new one arguing for upholding the pre-existing protections? Or is he just telling another outright lie? https://t.co/Xp5u2VcWx9 — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) August 8, 2020
Inside the sliding-glass doors of the hotel, others were similarly passionate. Kira Innis, 30, of Los Angeles, who claimed to have wanted Trump to run for president since she was 13, said the only thing that would force her to question her support would be if Trump sanded down his infamously rough edges.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld rules issued by the Trump administration that allow employers with religious or moral objections to deny women access to free birth control coverage.
Trav Robertson, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, criticized party colleagues who blasted Sanders for his visit and said he welcomed the visit.
The proposal, she said, would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner.
The Alabama law, in particular, was a wake-up call for many people. It goes further even than what some Republicans and abortion opponents support, because it doesn't have the rape and incest exceptions.
As part of the promotional campaign for Obama's visit to Milwaukee, the White House shared a letter a former opponent sent the president about his experience with the Affordable Care Act.
The proposal, she said, would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner.
At Bethlehem Baptist Church, and later at the oyster fry in Orangeburg, Biden's remarks only touched on one policy issue: criminal justice reform. Notably, his platform is an attempt to backtrack his legacy on the issue. He said he would end mandatory minimum sentencing, and expunge criminal records stemming from marijuana convictions.
One Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity that Trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the Iran deal or policy issues generally. He doesn't know, the adviser said. And he doesn't care.
The high cost of insurance, even with the Affordable Care Act in place, has been a major source of discontent with the law, especially among people in relatively good health who were able to purchase insurance previously ― and who had to pay more after the law took effect, because insurers for the first time were covering bills from people with severe medical needs.
The American Health Care Act would have cut Medicaid's budget by $834 billion, causing 14 million people to lose coverage. The Cassidy-Graham bill also sought to slash Medicaid. Those bills didn't become law, but not for want of Republicans trying. The Senate measure failed by a single vote (given that Vice President Mike Pence would've cast a tie-breaking vote in the event of a 50-50 tally).
Obamacare has also ended insurance company practices that caused misery for the minority of Americans buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers ― practices like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or selling skimpy plans that left out benefits like mental health and rehabilitative services.
Put more simply, conservatives worried that repeal didn't go far enough, while moderates worried that it went too far. Every effort Republican leaders made to appease one group alienated the other.
HuffPost asked a number of the leading presidential campaigns whether they were prepared to reject contributions over $200 from executives in the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. The campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a fellow proponent of Medicare for All, said it would do so.
But James has also run into a familiar political problem for Republicans. Back in 2017, he called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, describing the law as a monstrosity. Now he is under attack for trying to take away the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions.
There are four people testifying for Democrats: Sara Collins from the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund; Dr. Doris Browne, the former president of the National Medical Association; Dr. Farzon Nahvi, an emergency physician and professor in New York City; and Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
At times, Sanders' current tour revealed some of the limits of his reach. The crowd at the South Carolina rally was somewhat diverse, but it was visibly whiter than the population of Columbia, which is 41 percent black.
In fact, some of his supposed accomplishments further give the lie to his claim that he supports protections for preexisting conditions. The Trump administration has expanded access to several kinds of health insurance that aren't available to people with preexisting conditions, like short-term health plans.
That, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.
But when the Detroit Free Press editorial board pushed James for details on how he would do that, he said he's not a healthcare expert and that he'd rely on experts to work out a market-based solution. The Free Press ultimately endorsed Peters.
Meanwhile, Democrats have begun to wonder, with good reason, whether the specific reforms under discussion could hurt more insurance buyers than they would help.
Voters will have to decide what's more believable: That 10 Republican senators are standing up for Americans who have pre-existing conditions or that this is a sham being perpetrated by the party that has spent the past two years trying to do the opposite.
The proposal from Alexander and Collins seeks to mitigate those kinds of increases, primarily through two new spending initiatives. One would allocate $30.5 billion over three years for reinsurance and invisible high-risk pools, each of which would reimburse insurers for the beneficiaries with the biggest medical bills ― thereby allowing insurers to reduce premiums.
In 2017, Congress reduced the penalty to zero, as part of the Republican tax cut bill that Trump signed. Twenty Republican state officials then filed a new lawsuit, arguing that if the penalty was zero, the mandate ― whose language remains part of the statute ― can no longer be a tax.
Women are becoming the most powerful political force in America, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020. Cecile Richards, Supermajority co-founder
During his visit earlier this week, Macron tried to appeal to Trump's fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and Iran's role in funding regional conflicts. Merkel is to repeat that message Friday, according to Western European diplomats.
NextGen's announcement comes one day after the Biden campaign unveiled a new youth outreach effort, dubbed League 46. That effort, led by Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders, includes an expansion of an existing Students for Biden group, along with the launch of groups of young professionals for Biden and young elected officials for Biden.
Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) contested the question of criteria for witnesses. He told HuffPost in a statement that the committee had free [rein] to make all decisions about this hearing.
In his speech on Wednesday, Sanders focused on debunking arguments put forward by Biden and other centrist politicians and think tanks who have warned against a plan that forces people to give up the private health insurance they have in favor of something unknown.
Trump's proposal has many in Congress wondering if this plan is doable, since many of their constituency could actually end up paying more taxes. However, according to the Tax Policy Center, almost half of the benefits of Trump's plan would gravitate to the top 1 percent or those earning more than $700,000 annually. But the bigger question is, given Trump's political and possibly legal problems, will such a plan actually occur?
The Trump administration's decision and, now, McElvain's departure have some experts worried about the future of the Justice Department, which historically has tried to insulate these sort of legal functions from partisanship and political meddling from above.
OLIVIER DOULIERY/Getty Images Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has a long record of moderate positions on crime, including his current opposition to police funding cuts, that Trump wants Americans to forget.
Many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. Restoring CSR funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. The federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.
An eerie Fox News video of Donald Trump talking about an economic crash and riots as a route back to when America was great has resurfaced as the longest government shutdown in U.S. history continues to fray services.
Officials in both parties have said this is a major problem they want to address. Democrats have proposed a variety of options, all of which entail some combination of bolstering the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance, using government to control prices and creating new public plans that can offer alternative coverage.
The phrase death panels became part of America's political vocabulary in 2009, when Republicans were trying to stop the legislation that eventually became the Affordable Care Act.
Or maybe those Canadians aren't so dumb after all and have figured out how to provide better healthcare opportunities to a wider range of people and not just the anointed elite?
Unsurprisingly, it immediately received flak from both Sanders' and Biden's campaigns, who criticized it for going too far, and not far enough.
Obamacare has also ended insurance company practices that caused misery for the minority of Americans buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers ― practices like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or selling skimpy plans that left out benefits like mental health and rehabilitative services.
Scholten, a former minor league baseball pitcher and devout Catholic, is a natural ideological fit for the Brooklyn-born Sanders. Casting himself as heir to the forgotten tradition of farmer populists in Iowa, Scholten is running in support of Medicare for all and taking on the monopoly seed and livestock conglomerates he believes are squeezing small farmers.
The most potent symbol of how they pivoted away from jobs was that they put then-Vice President Joe Biden in charge of it, he said.
These short-term plans can be very cheap because they don't end up paying much in the way of medical bills. They reliably draw in healthy people, leaving them exposed to large medical bills if they get sick even, as they force insurers to jack up prices for more comprehensive coverage.
Early reports have suggested that insurers were expecting better performance this year, thanks in part to the higher premiums. But insurers are already calculating next year's rates and are supposed to finalize them by the spring. If they are not sure the mandate will be fully enforced next year, they could decide on higher premiums or even more exits from state markets.
Trump is part of a lawsuit the Supreme Court is scheduled to take up in November (after Election Day, of course) that could eliminate the whole law. This, in fact, is Trump's vision for health care reform, not whatever bogus claims he makes to get him out of a political jam he put himself in by joining a legal case originated by a bunch of Republican state officeholders.
You call that whatever the heck you want to call it ― it's not Medicare for All, he said Tuesday in an interview on CNN.
The other big initiative in the Alexander-Collins proposal would resume cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which are a separate set of federal payments to insurers that President Donald Trump stopped in October.
In Nebraska, an ad for Rep. Don Bacon ― who famously declared himself a hell yes on repeal legislation in 2017 ― talks about a sister who died of cancer and proclaims that he is committed to affordable health care and protecting preexisting conditions.
But the Republican majority in the Senate isn't interested in pursuing additional emergency relief for those who suddenly find themselves uninsured.
A proposal designed to stabilize Obamacare and reduce health insurance premiums for some Americans seems unlikely to become law anytime soon.
At times, Sanders' current tour revealed some of the limits of his reach. The crowd at the South Carolina rally was somewhat diverse, but it was visibly whiter than the population of Columbia, which is 41 percent black.
Another conservative pundit, Ben Shapiro, was even more direct: If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19, Shapiro said, adding later, If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, that's tragic and it's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80, so that is not the same thing.
Preexisting conditions have to continue to be solved, Perdue said. We have to figure out a way that people don't lose their insurance when they lose their job, and then we have to get after the real causes of health care costs.
To make her action even worse, DeVos in her official notification claimed that her delay in enforcing the rule for all schools across the country was in light of Contreras's new decision, even though that decision applied only to a narrow set of appeals pursued by a small group of cosmetology schools.
The merits of the case are notoriously weak. Even conservative and libertarian lawyers who supported past challenges to Obamacare have filed friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to reject this one. For that reason, many legal observers think the chances of this lawsuit succeeding are relatively small.
Last year, Trump triumphantly signed a huge tax cut bill. The GOP line when this legislation was going through Congress was that it would pay for itself. It did not. It predictably blew a giant hole in the budget and increased the deficit.
Correction: A previous version of this article said the House Rules Committee had not yet released the names of all the witnesses for the hearing, but it has.
The Affordable Care Act protects people with preexisting conditions, mostly by prohibiting insurers from denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. It also requires that all plans cover 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday released her version of Medicare for All, a plan to create a new, government-run insurance plan designed to cover all Americans and pay for nearly all their medical expenses. The proposal would likely eliminate existing employer-sponsored plans, over the course of a decadelong transition, but allow private insurers to offer an alternative form of coverage, much as they do today for seniors on Medicare.
Primus also did himself no favors in a March 25 meeting with staff from a number of congressional committees that have health care jurisdiction. He reportedly said the Medicare for All hearing was a check the box and move on type of thing.
Aside from Sanders' pledge, however, the speech served as an implicit rebuttal to Biden and other Democrats who have adopted conservative talking points in their efforts to discredit Sanders' plan.
As Sanders was walking out of the facility in shirtsleeves, a student called out to him. Bernie, are you tired yet?

That's not a plan. It's a plan to come up with a plan that won't work because the White House can't just order hospitals not to bill people. Again, that's why lawmaking exists.
The GOP's Empty Promises On Health Care
There were two baskets prepared by Mrs. Patmore. Two! And they were big.
That's significant, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based out of Washington.
These attacks were especially galling to reform proponents because it was the opposite of what they were trying to do.
Under the Alexander-Collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or CSR funds could pay for abortion services. If that were to become law, then it's almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.
Under the lran deal legislation passed by Congress, Trump must certify every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of U.S. sanctions. Trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. Last October, he refused to certify that Iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, May 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has rejected donations from top pharmaceutical company executives and corporate board chairs since 2017, though his campaign did not immediately say whether he would do the same for health insurance companies.
Death Panels In The Age Of Coronavirus
Overcoming this reality has proven difficult. Hampton offers a perfect example. She works in the health insurance industry, and health care is her biggest priority. Her policy preferences more resemble Sanders and Warren's vision of a government-run health insurance system than Biden's proposal to expand a public option within a private system.
Somebody, it seems, forgot to give candidate Donald Trump the memo.
As vice president, Biden was reportedly reluctant to pursue Obamacare. As a senator, he played a key role in writing and passing policies, such as harsh penalties for drug possession, that led to today's criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes minorities. And he backed the Iraq War, while Obama's opposition to the invasion was a key issue that propelled him ahead of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.
The Affordable Care Act strengthened Medicaid by funding new home-based care options for the disabled and elderly. These initiatives would lose their authorization, leaving decisions about whether to continue the programs in the hands of cash-strapped state officials.
The outcome of the fight won't be determined solely by messaging: American families will determine if the $1,400 checks and expanded child tax credit included in the plan will help them or not; the schools Biden is promising will soon open will either begin allowing students to return or keep their doors shut; the inflation Republicans predict will either arrive or it won't.
Another Orangeburg resident, Mary Hampton, 58, said that she can trust Biden for standing strong with Obama.
Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.
That's not the case today. Today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don't use federal dollars of any kind. In other words, insurers can't use money they've received in the form of premium tax credits. Back when CSR money was coming in, they couldn't use that money either.
Lawmakers from both parties had collaborated in the late 1990s to create a new program for insuring children. The senators who led that effort were Orrin Hatch, the conservative Republican from Utah, and Ted Kennedy, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. At one point in 2008, a former Kennedy aide told me, Hatch dispatched his advisers to see if the two could work together on a universal coverage bill.
In the moments after it was announced that his health care bill was dead and pulled from consideration, President Donald Trump had pinpointed the culprit. Democrats, he explained, were to blame for the failure because they refused to provide him with any of their votes.
As for the current health care law, on which some 20 million people depend for insurance, its odds of survival seem better than at any time since Trump's election, when its repeal seemed nearly inevitable.
That's not how immigration enforcement works, she said.
Trump's address was also peppered with lies, misstatements and distortions about both his record and Biden's positions, many of which were repeated at other points during the convention. Going over every last lie would require a Herculean effort, but two of them were critical, and Trump is likely to repeat them again and again over the final weeks of the race.
We don't know what prompted DeVos to craft this gross misstatement and to implement this wholesale abandonment of protections for students and taxpayers against waste, fraud, and abuse by predatory for-profit colleges. We can only remind you that Robert Eitel, Senior Counselor to DeVos, was, when he joined the Department, an executive at Bridgepoint Education, a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior, and before that was at Career Education Corp., a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior; Eitel reportedly committed when he arrived to recuse himself from matters related to those schools and from the Department's review of the gainful employment rule, but apparently not to issues related to for-profit colleges generally. We also can tell you that Devos herself invested money in for-profit education, that Republicans in Congress have long done the bidding of the for-profit college industry, which has donated big money to the GOP, and that DeVos's boss Donald Trump owned his own for-profit real estate university, whose predatory practices were similar to practices of for-profit colleges that stand to benefit from DeVos's trashing of the Obama rules.
A primary goal was to help people likely to struggle with medical bills because of their physical condition or finances ― which is why, for example, Democrats wanted to prohibit insurers from denying policies to people with pre-existing conditions and to improve coverage of prescription drugs for seniors.
Regardless of what happens now, health care is likely to remain a subject of controversy.
During the course of putting together the repeal-and-replace process for Obamacare, Trump never once reached out to a member of the Democratic leadership to discuss policy matters or vote counts. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office confirmed as much. So too did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office.
The first is his claim that the entire Republican Party would always, and very strongly, protect patients with preexisting conditions. This simply isn't true. The GOP has dedicated dozens of congressional votes over the years to repealing Obamacare, including its protections blocking insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting health conditions. Trump's Justice Department supports a lawsuit aiming to strike down the entire law that is soon to go before the Supreme Court. Various Republicans have tried to introduce legislation that could replace Obamacare's protections, but health care experts have consistently said those bills would fall short of the protections the Affordable Care Act offers.
But even with the fierce sniping about Medicare for All, which has become a litmus test in the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, the candidates have yet to explain how any version of the proposal would pass in a sharply divided Senate ― even if Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) finds himself the minority leader once again.
Of those four witnesses, perhaps only Nahvi is actually an advocate for Medicare for All, the single-payer health care system that would transition everyone to Medicare. And even then, sources tell HuffPost that Nahvi's testimony is supposed to be limited to how patient experience would change. That means that when the Rules Committee convenes this hearing on Tuesday, there may not be any witness testifying who will make the case for Medicare for All over other health care plans.
What I did not see, for example, was Republican governors refusing [federal] Medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people, Obama said. We've never seen in American history a situation in which state governments reject benefits for their people purely on ideological grounds.
The good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million Americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, Cornyn said in a PBS Austin interview. As you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. So that's an option for people.
The direct aid, along with additional funding to reopen schools and speed up vaccine distribution, is meant to quickly help Americans regardless of their employment status, while the stimulus's extensive funding for state governments and spending on infrastructure projects was explicitly intended to create jobs.
This article has been updated with Amash's comments.
The bill would have made some other major changes, as well ― such as ending the individual mandate, the unpopular financial penalty for people who do not get health insurance, and rolling back new taxes on the wealthy and health care companies that the government uses to finance the law's coverage expansion.
Rebecca Cook/Reuters Republican John James, who is running for the U.S. Senate from Michigan, once called the Affordable Care Act a monstrosity. He has not offered details on how he would replace it.
But the weakest argument, the one that has prompted so many of the law's critics to dismiss it, is about a concept called severability. Under a well-established doctrine, judges ruling part of a law unconstitutional are supposed to do minimal damage to the rest of the law if they can.
What I did not see, for example, was Republican governors refusing [federal] Medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people.
These findings, based on several surveys, are merely the latest proof that, whatever its shortcomings, the Affordable Care Act has succeeded in its primary goal of reducing the number of Americans who lack health insurance. The share of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance was 11.5 percent as of February, down from 20.3 percent in October 2013, according to the report. Other polls that include children and people over 65 show an even lower uninsured rate.
Somebody, it seems, forgot to give candidate Donald Trump the memo.
The merits of the case are notoriously weak. Even conservative and libertarian lawyers who supported past challenges to Obamacare have filed friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to reject this one. For that reason, many legal observers think the chances of this lawsuit succeeding are relatively small.
The term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what Trump is perpetrating. His claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
Sanctuary policies make a difference, he said. They reduce the level of fear.
Just to take one example, experts have warned for years that underpaid, overworked staff and weak inspection regimens put nursing home residents at greater risk of infection. But since taking office, the Trump administration has been rolling back safety regulations. As recently as three weeks ago, even as COVID-19 was continuing to ravage nursing homes, administration officials were defending that effort.
What someone promises to do doesn't mean a whole lot, Huffmon said. Now primary voters tend to be more educated on the issues, and more passionate, but a lot of voters do retrospective voting. In the past they judged Obama as good, and that's who they trusted and Biden is linked to him.
That vow, not to support a plan that pulls the rug out from under people, may sound familiar. It's the same promise Republicans kept making in 2017 after Donald Trump became president and they were trying to write repeal legislation.
In an interview aboard his district-traversing RV Sioux City Sue, Scholten dismissed the idea that Sanders' left-wing policies might be a political liability in his district.
Sure, premiums wouldn't be allowed to vary based on health status or pre-existing conditions. But prices could dramatically vary based on age, gender, occupation and other factors, including hobbies, in ways that are functionally the same as basing them on medical histories. Insurance companies have a lot of experience figuring out that stuff.
And once again it is a subset of conservatives and Republicans resisting these steps, by seeking to end extensions of unemployment benefits and fighting aid to state and local governments that would finance other public services.
More conservative members, led by the House Freedom Caucus, were angry that the bill left some of the Affordable Care Act's insurance regulations in place. Those regulations, they suggested, would keep premiums from falling further ― although the precise relationship between each of these regulations and actual premiums is murky.
Sanders argued, as he has before, that the middle class tax increases needed to pay for Medicare for All would be more than outweighed by the savings people would earn from the elimination of private health insurance plans' premiums, deductibles and co-payments.
I say to President (Donald) Trump that this country has struggled for too many years, for too many centuries in combating racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia, Sanders declared. We are not going backwards. We are going forwards ― as one people.
Those changes are one reason the number of Americans without health insurance is so much lower than it was before the Affordable Care Act became law.
I strongly doubt he understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement, said Richard Nephew, a top State Department official in charge of Iran sanctions during the period the agreement was being negotiated.
Trump had actually started talking about Obamacare in his opening statement ― when he said that premiums were going up with numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 71 percent. Then, after Clinton had given her assessment of the law, he continued with the theme:
But the effects of invalidation of the ACA would be devastating to our entire health care system, said Timothy Jost, a law professor emeritus at Washington and Lee.
The Iran deal is a terrible deal. We paid $150 billion. We gave $1.8 billion in cash. That's actual cash, barrels of cash. It's insane. It's ridiculous. It should have never been made, Trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.
The truth is that, like in so many other areas, Trump doesn't want to do the work. After all, as Trump once said, health care is complicated! Who needs the headache when there are people of color to insult and golf to play?
Most immigrants do not use food stamps and other forms of public assistance. The vast majority of food stamp beneficiaries — 92 percent — are U.S.-born citizens. Four percent are naturalized citizens, 1 percent are refugees, and 3 percent are other noncitizens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The average benefit for one person is $126.76 a month.
Republicans have been very busy lying about health care: lying about their policy agenda, lying about Democrats calling them liars and lying about who said who was really lying about all this.

But the new statements from Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to President Donald Trump, come with all the usual caveats.
One of those structural problems, he said, is that the conservative media universe operates in an entirely different universe, less tethered to reality. Another, he said, is the makeup U.S. Senate, where the small-state bias gives lawmakers representing a small portion of the population the ability to block legislation ― and to escape accountability for doing so.

But that was in the 1960s. Today we are in 2019, Sanders concluded. In my view, now is the time, not for tinkering around the edges ... Now is the time to do what the American people want us to do, now is the time to pass a Medicare for All, single-payer program.
But there is no way to be sure, especially because her answer left some observers thinking she might agree with the plaintiffs on the rest of the argument.
Some would still get insurance, and if they are young and healthy, they might even be able to get it more cheaply than they do now. But they would likely have less-comprehensive coverage with big gaps in benefits.
The law's likely overhaul puts many hospitals in a uniquely daunting position of being unable to predict how many of their patients will be insured and what type of coverage they will have in the future. As a result, many are more wary than in years past to invest in expensive capital projects, issue debt, or expand into new regions, said healthcare experts and hospital executives.
Congressional Republicans spent a good chunk of last year trying to repeal all or most of the Affordable Care Act, for instance, which already dealt with the problems of people with pre-existing conditions being shut out of health coverage or charged exorbitant rates. Against all evidence, these lawmakers constantly denied what they were doing, so we've seen this before.
And let's not forget what Congress did last year, even though that's what GOP candidates want everyone to do.
The dreaded trial didn't happen! Another anti-climax. Hurray! Bring 'em on. Nothing like dashed expectations in a gorgeous setting to get the heart racing.
Eliminating the filibuster would mitigate, although not eliminate, the small-state bias ― and Obama said that may be necessary. When I pressed to see if he'd endorse the idea more clearly, he said, That's a longer argument and discussion to have. (Several months later, at the funeral of Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Obama offered a stronger endorsement for ending the 60-vote requirement, though he was specifically speaking about voting rights legislation.)
My son has a preexisting condition ... I will always fight to protect your health care, James told WXYZ-TV, the ABC affiliate in Detroit.
Lord Grantham finally collapsed after endless build-up, but sadly didn't die. Everyone on that show looks so very good in black.
Trump also took aim at Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's health care plan ― or a caricature of it, anyway.
Rumors fuel the fear, said Maricela Delcid, a navigator at the nonprofit who helps eligible immigrants enroll in social services. Most of the immigrant parents she works with are undocumented, and therefore don't qualify for benefits such as food stamps. But they don't understand that they can apply on behalf of their U.S.-born children, Delcid said.
That includes requirements affecting which benefits insurance plans cover, as well as requirements on who gets financial assistance and how much, and how the people choosing insurance can use that assistance.
This also does not take into account all the kinds of assistance navigators provide all year, such as helping with complex cases and issues and filing appeals. Florida will definitely be hit hard by this.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during the National Urban League Conference, Friday, July 26, 2019, in Indianapolis.
But at CPAC, these types of comments, even from those proudly toting Trump paraphernalia, were the minority. Most attendees said that while they were uncomfortable with Trump's warts, they were able to overlook look them because he was a vessel for their policies.
Officials in both parties have said this is a major problem they want to address. Democrats have proposed a variety of options, all of which entail some combination of bolstering the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance, using government to control prices and creating new public plans that can offer alternative coverage.
The bill would have ended Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and cut funding for the rest of the Medicaid program going forward. It would have scaled back regulations on what insurance covers. It also would have redistributed financial assistance, so that people with lower incomes and higher insurance costs would get less than they do today ― even as more affluent people would qualify for substantial new subsidies.
Bossert is in charge of defending Americans against violence ― not lavishing praise on Trump when he broadcasts a violent revenge fantasy against our country's free press. Disgraceful.
But it was all based on nothing. McCaughey's influence enrages actual policy experts who read legislation and accurately dissect the implications of new programs. As the typically measured Ezra Klein put it in The Washington Post in 2009: Betsy McCaughey is really just a horrible, evil, awful, lying person who wants to make the world worse for people because that's her ticket to increased TV time. There's no other way to put it.
During his first year in office, Trump's top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But in the past two months, Trump has fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leaving Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.
And a political threat continues to loom over Obamacare, The Republican Congress is again vowing to develop a plan to replace the law, although they've made little noticeable progress since Obama signed the ACA six years ago this month.
The Trump administration's campaign to undermine the Affordable Care Act notched another achievement Tuesday.
Democrats have noticed what the Trump administration is doing and are hoping voters do, too. Nationally, Democratic candidates have made rising health care costs a central plank in their platform during this year's midterm elections, and Tuesday's announcement provides them more fodder for their case that the GOP is mishandling the health care system.
Since shortly after Trump took office, his administration and the GOP Congress have taken a variety of actions to weaken the Affordable Care Act and its health insurance exchanges in particular.
I was never under an illusion that we would get majority Republican support, Obama said. But it was my belief that a law signed by Mitt Romney, and that could be traced back to ideas that had appeared in the Heritage Foundation literature, would give some political cover to those Republicans who were so inclined to vote for it.
Even as some Democratic operatives privately concede Republican voters are likely to unite against the bill in the not-so-distant future, they have both messaging and policy reasons to be confident the bill will remain broadly popular.
James tried to deflect the anger by insisting that, notwithstanding his support of repeal, he was committed to preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions. He lost anyway.
She raised her hand when asked whether she would abolish private insurance during the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami in late June, but subsequently disavowed the remark, claiming she had misheard the question.
No! Sanders replied. I'm just waking up.
Without the stepped-up immigration enforcement of Secure Communities, Alsan and Yang estimate that ACA enrollment among Latino immigrants would be 22 percent higher.
Now let's talk about what Trump and his party are doing.
I think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised when they see the child tax credit and the fact that they will be getting essentially bonus checks to support their family based on how many children they have, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost. So I think really aggressively messaging the specific tangible aspects of this bill that everyday people can see and feel is what's most important.
That effort did not succeed, but as part of their 2017 tax cut, Republicans managed to zero out the law's individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance by hitting them with a financial penalty if they don't. The Trump administration has also taken a series of executive actions, such as slashing the Affordable Care Act's advertising budget, that have depressed enrollment or otherwise undermined it.
The problem with this argument is that Congress last year made a clear decision to keep the protections but toss the mandate. The lawsuit essentially argues that this more recent action doesn't matter.
The concept was notional until April 2006, when a state-level reform fitting those criteria became law in Massachusetts, with the signature of a Republican governor (Mitt Romney) and support of some conservative intellectuals (at the Heritage Foundation). It was proof of concept for the Democrats ― including Obama, who, while putting together his campaign health plan, was already thinking about what might get GOP votes.
A top White House adviser said Sunday that the Trump administration may use its executive authority to weaken or effectively eliminate Obamacare's individual mandate.
After eight years of Barack Obama and tax-and-spend economics, a Republican who doesn't do a very good job would have to do a really bad job to anger the movement, said Cody Leach, of Maryland. We have to be a faithful party because we are faithful servants. We have to lead him [Trump] to the light.
What is the price of a human life, Mister Ip? If your son or daughter needed a million dollars worth of brain surgery this week to survive, I am sure you could pass the hat around to your fellow white co-workers at the Wall Street Journal and raise your $12,000 deductible or maximum out-of-pocket costs, but could the average minority in America do the same?
The rule DeVos blocked, therefore, has certainly not been repeatedly ... overturned by the courts. That was a lie, and a phony excuse for blocking the rule.
What I did not see, for example, was Republican governors refusing [federal] Medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people.
I feel like a rabbit in a cage, said Marta, 62, who moved to the United States from El Salvador 16 years ago, and didn't want her surname used because she is living here illegally. Added Maria Monestel, an 81-year-old babysitter from Costa Rica, Everyone is scared. They think they don't have any rights.
Among those who fought hardest against the Republicans' repeal efforts were organizations representing people with disabilities, people with serious diseases and the elderly.
And the Obamacare issue raged on--this time with Neville Chamberlain making a guest appearance, an acting black hole who probably sucked the blood right out of Lord Grantham's ulcer.
Some struggle to pay premiums, while others decide not to get insurance altogether. Those problems are likely to get even worse next year, because the 2017 Republican tax bill eliminated the penalty for people who don't get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get insurance, causing premiums to rise.
Acting Quickly On The Mandate Could Cause Serious Aftershocks
Trump's proposal has many in Congress wondering if this plan is doable, since many of their constituency could actually end up paying more taxes. However, according to the Tax Policy Center, almost half of the benefits of Trump's plan would gravitate to the top 1 percent or those earning more than $700,000 annually. But the bigger question is, given Trump's political and possibly legal problems, will such a plan actually occur?
And it was telling that neither the state's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, state Rep. James Smith, nor any of the party's House contenders shared the stage with Sanders.

Before the Affordable Care Act, it already was illegal for health insurance companies to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them more based on their medical histories if they got coverage through a group plan, like from an employer. And insurers and employers are limited in how much they could refuse to pay for treatments related to a pre-existing condition for group policyholders. The Affordable Care Act extended similar protections to people who buy their health insurance directly or via the exchanges the law created.
The mandate has been credited with significantly reducing birth control costs across the country. Before the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, contraceptives made up about 30% of women's total out-of-pocket health care costs, according to the National Women's Law Center. In 2013, the mandate saved women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills.
In Colorado, an ad for Sen. Cory Gardner, who also supported repeal legislation, showcases his mother, a cancer survivor. Then he promises to protect people with preexisting conditions no matter what happens to Obamacare.
Republicans' ideas are unpopular. Their president is historically unpopular. Their failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and their deliberate mismanagement and weakening of the law's benefits are unpopular. They are under sustained assault from Democrats highlighting (and mostly accurately describing) the GOP health policy agenda, especially on the question of people with pre-existing conditions. And most Americans are inclined to side with Democrats on this issue.
Under guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services that takes effect immediately but likely won't affect insurance markets for another year, state governments will have new leeway to request waivers from some of the federal health care law's core requirements.

You want a social safety net that gives you things when you lose your job — that's why we have unemployment insurance. It would be nice if your health side also looked more like that across the U.S. Sarah Miller, health economist at University of Michigan
Generally we'd like to avoid including generals Mattis and McMaster in our rankings because, although Trump's over-reliance on active duty or recently retired military personnel for national security jobs is concerning, at least these men are qualified for their positions and are a major improvement over Trump's favorite good guy, the corrupt, vengeful hothead Michael Flynn.
Now my Republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the American people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! he mused, drawing laughs from the crowd.
Premiums are rising more quickly this year, with insurers requesting an average increase of 25 percent, according to Charles Gaba of acasignups.net. That's an average, with a great deal of variation ― and there are, in fact, people whose plans are getting dramatically more expensive next year.
WASHINGTON ― It's supposed to be the first congressional hearing ever on Medicare for All ― a huge win for single-payer advocates and progressives in Congress. But next week, when the House Rules Committee holds that landmark hearing on the expansive health care legislation, Medicare for All advocates may actually be getting screwed.

Taxes were a key item in Donald Trump's presidential agenda. He and his advisors feel that revision of the nation's tax code will spur economic growth and, besides changing healthcare policy, be a hallmark of his presidency. However, his proposed tax policy will benefit businesses and the wealthy, while hurting the middle class, the poor, and ballooning the federal budget deficit and the national debt.

Inside the sliding-glass doors of the hotel, others were similarly passionate. Kira Innis, 30, of Los Angeles, who claimed to have wanted Trump to run for president since she was 13, said the only thing that would force her to question her support would be if Trump sanded down his infamously rough edges.
Talking about his starter home, Obama told me, It's been vandalized. And people at times tried to undermine its foundations. But it's held up. He's right, and now the Biden administration may even have a chance to do some of the repair work Obama never could, starting with extra funding for subsidies that is already in the Democratic COVID-19 relief bill.
When DeVos declined to commit to proceeding with the gainful employment rule at her confirmation hearing in January, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), said, Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like that.
Sure, premiums wouldn't be allowed to vary based on health status or pre-existing conditions. But prices could dramatically vary based on age, gender, occupation and other factors, including hobbies, in ways that are functionally the same as basing them on medical histories. Insurance companies have a lot of experience figuring out that stuff.
In comparison to the 2009 law, which contained a relatively paltry $25 boost to weekly unemployment checks, the COVID-19 relief bill offers a $300-a-week boost, along with $1,400 checks for most Americans and an expanded child tax credit that should regularly funnel money to poor and working class families soon.

Health care policy is all about tradeoffs, so for all these changes, there would be countereffects, including a reduction in taxes on the wealthy that the Affordable Care Act raised to finance its coverage expansions.
Scholten, a former minor league baseball pitcher and devout Catholic, is a natural ideological fit for the Brooklyn-born Sanders. Casting himself as heir to the forgotten tradition of farmer populists in Iowa, Scholten is running in support of Medicare for all and taking on the monopoly seed and livestock conglomerates he believes are squeezing small farmers.
Political opportunism helps to explain the apparent shift. In 2009, Republicans and conservatives were trying to block legislation from then-President Barack Obama. Now they are trying to promote and defend President Donald Trump, who has been agitating to end social distancing to open businesses and revive the economy.
Amid those lies, however, GOP officials and candidates have occasionally lapsed and told the truth: The party, like it always has, wants to cut federal health care programs. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, still without having any idea how to replace it, and they're working hard to make the law worse in the meantime. They want to slash Medicaid. They want to shrink Medicare.
That will be the distillation of our message to the American people in the coming weeks, that help is here for them and their families, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, the White House deputy chief of staff who served as Biden's campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staffers. And we're going to carry that message to every corner of our country through travel, local press, and direct engagement in communities with the President, the Vice President, the first lady, the Second Gentleman, Cabinet members, and top officials from throughout the administration.
Let's start with one big difference: The American Rescue Plan is starting off a lot more popular than the 2009 stimulus. A CNN poll released Wednesday found 61% of Americans support the plan, including 58% of independents and 26% of Republicans. Only 37% of Americans were firmly opposed to the legislation. Other polls, including one from the Pew Research Center, have found even higher levels of support.
And as much as Republicans point to Tillis' bill as evidence of their desire to protect people with preexisting conditions, it has little chance of passing in a divided Senate. Moreover, experts say it would allow insurers to exclude coverage of some preexisting conditions anyway, calling its provisions a mirage.
But for Republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the Iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.
There's a fear of exposing family members, said Crystal Yang, assistant professor of law at Harvard Law School, one of the report's authors.
A key problem with the plan is that the federal deduction for state and local income taxes would be eliminated, thereby hurting taxpayers in New York, California, or Massachusetts who pay high amounts. The residents of those and other such states would be severely hurt since their taxes are much higher than places like Florida and Texas, and would actually see a severely substantial tax increase. According to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, taxpayers using this deduction save more than $100 billion, which is actually greater than the mortgage interest deduction.
No, he said quickly, because it passed, and 20 million people got health insurance, and it's still there. Then he paused, opened his eyes a bit wider, and started up again: But I think what it does reveal is some major structural problems in our current political system that make it much harder to do big things than it used to be.
When evidence developed that the video Trump tweeted may have come from a reddit user who had posted racist comments in the past, that reddit user, name of HansAssholeSolo, apologized, which prompted Paul Begala to tweet,If only our President had the conscience and class of HansAssholeSolo.

Some experts have warned that even hinting about efforts to undermine the mandate could destabilize Obamacare's already-fragile insurance markets.
Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. Only gets worse. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more and more money. We have almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It's very bad. Very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. One of the biggest line items very shortly.

Why did Aetna agree to a deal that included a $1 billion break-up fee? When the company agreed to this condition, did Aetna conduct an internal assessment of the risk of a DOJ challenge? When Aetna agreed to pay this fee, was Aetna aware that it would endanger participation in the ACA exchanges?
To be sure, it's hard to make a clear comparison between Medicaid expansion and growing numbers of uninsured, especially because health care providers have only recently begun loosening restrictions around preventative care checkups and other services that were deemed nonessential during the early weeks of the pandemic.
Brendan McDermid/Reuters Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), right, criticized Joe Biden for signing off on trade deals that cost the U.S. manufacturing jobs. Trump is attacking Biden's trade record as well.
In addition to the cuts in enrollment assistance and advertising for the sign-up periods, Trump has cut two important funding streams to health insurance companies, the second of which his administration halted just days ago. The previous decision to cut off billions in payments owed to insurers resulted in significant premium increases for this year, and the latest one could do the same.
As attention turns to the 2020 Democratic presidential race, the 77-year-old Sanders benefits from his surprisingly strong showing in 2016 against Clinton, who began that race as the prohibitive favorite. But some party strategists believe a big reason for his success was voter antipathy toward her.
Republican officials from 20 states are asking a federal judge in Texas to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, which would include its provisions guaranteeing access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.

A highly respected career lawyer at the Justice Department has decided to resign just days after the Trump administration backed a controversial lawsuit that would wreck part of the Affordable Care Act.
The law has allowed something like 20 million people to get insurance, bringing the number of uninsured to a record low. Predictions that the law would cause national health care costs to skyrocket have proved spectacularly wrong, as have predictions that the law would cause the deficit to explode or kill the job market.
We know that there are millions more who are eligible for coverage but haven't gotten it yet, Obama said.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Joe Biden's strategy for winning the Democratic presidential nomination hinges in part on a convincing win in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. Here, he campaigns at an oyster roast event on Sunday in Orangeburg, S.C.
In the end, however, the effort was for naught. Leaders couldn't come up with language that would draw enough votes from the two holdout GOP factions to overcome the unified opposition of Democrats.
WASHINGTON ― Democrats are gearing up to turn abortion into a key issue for the 2020 elections, saying it could turn out to be an issue that mirrors the fight to preserve the Affordable Care Act in 2018.
Two weeks of the major party political conventions delivered 16 hours of prime-time programming, more than 120 individual speakers, dozens of pre-produced glossy videos and zero fundamental change in the race.
But, she's 99% committed to Biden.
In addition, CBO said, the proportion of Americans without health insurance would rise even more dramatically ― by 18 million, which is roughly the number of people who have gotten coverage through the law, according to the most reliable estimates.
McSally, who later lost a Senate race for one of Arizona's seats before being appointed to the other, now has a different outlook. It's not about government-run health care or about repealing Obamacare in its entirety, she said in a campaign video earlier this month. It's about bringing the cost down.
Some would still get insurance, and if they are young and healthy, they might even be able to get it more cheaply than they do now. But they would likely have less-comprehensive coverage with big gaps in benefits.
You get the program started, you figure out what the kinks are, what works, what doesn't. You amend, build, improve, refine ― that kind of iterative process, where you've set a goal and gotten the foundations laid, and then Congress in a cooperative fashion works to keep making it better. That process, which is very beneficial because you're getting real data and feedback about what's working and what's not ― that's less available to you now. The process that built Social Security, built Medicaid, Medicare, that only works if you got both parties working in good faith.
Democrats say they won't make the same mistake again. While its legislative path remains uncertain, the White House is aiming to pass legislation built around Biden's Build Back Better plan ― which could make some of the tax credits and health care subsidies included in Rescue Act permanent, and also include billions in infrastructure spending ― sometime this spring or summer.
Other Republicans who are facing a competitive reelection fight are similarly choosing their words carefully when discussing Obamacare.
When HuffPost reached Baker by phone, he made it clear that he thinks a Medicare buy-in approach makes more sense financially and pragmatically from a health care perspective. He also said it was reasonable that single-payer supporters may want a more forceful advocate of Medicare for All.
Courtesy Barack Obama Presidential Library. Joe Biden, seen here with then-President Barack Obama celebrating House passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, now has a chance to reinforce and build on the health care law in a way that Obama never did.
The debut of this phony bill Friday is the latest installment in Republicans' long-running campaign to make the health care system worse for anyone who has ever been sick while loudly proclaiming they are doing the opposite.
Cities that didn't cooperate with Secure Communities didn't see the same declines.
We have a legacy system that is one-sixth of the economy, Obama said. The idea that you could, in some way, dismantle that entire system ― or even transition it entirely ― to a single payer system looked politically impractical and probably really disruptive. ... The best chance to actually get people healthier was going to be to design a system that acknowledged 85% of the American people have health insurance and that plugged the gap for those 15% who don't.
When HuffPost reached Baker by phone, he made it clear that he thinks a Medicare buy-in approach makes more sense financially and pragmatically from a health care perspective. He also said it was reasonable that single-payer supporters may want a more forceful advocate of Medicare for All.
But that chance never came, because Republicans focused on repeal and, at times, trying to sabotage the program outright. Think about Medicare, Obama said. That was a big political fight, but once it got passed, everybody moved on and tried to make it work. Bush's drug benefit program, right? It was a contentious issue. But once it got passed, even those Democrats who had opposed it tried to make it work.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken numerous steps to worsen the health insurance market for people with pre-existing conditions.
The uncertainty has seeped into the municipal bond market, where nonprofit hospitals access capital. The sector sold 36 percent less debt for new projects so far in 2017, compared to the same period last year, while the rest of the municipal market increased the amount of new money issued by 23 percent, Thomson Reuters data shows. While municipal analysts say it's too early to draw conclusions, the uncertainty surrounding Obamacare is a likely cause for the decline.
In response to questions about there not being a true Medicare for All advocate on the panel, the Rules Committee pointed to Baker and sent a NowThis video of Nahvi endorsing single-payer health care. (Nahvi also wrote an op-ed in The Guardian that speaks positively about single-payer.)
As a result, some middle- and upper-income Americans are likely to see pretty big premium spikes this fall, above and beyond the usual increases, right before the midterm elections. And they may be looking for somebody to blame.
The Washington Post via Getty Images Seema Verma, the Trump administration official who oversees federal health programs, says Monday's rule change will give states more flexibility. The question is how much flexibility, whether it's consistent with the law and ultimately how it would affect consumers.
In a separate, prerecorded interview that ran Sunday on NBC's Today show, Conway reiterated a promise she and other Republican officials have made repeatedly: That nobody with insurance through Obamacare right now would lose it in the transition to a new system.
The original impetus for guaranteeing CSR payments was to avoid disruption, since insurers had been counting upon those payments and Trump was loudly threatening to stop them (as he eventually did). Last fall, Alexander, who is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, worked closely with his Democratic counterpart, ranking minority member Patty Murray of Washington state, on a bill that would have funded CSRs. It was a rare show of genuine bipartisanship.
That's an important shift because sometime this month the agency is expected to publish a regulation that would permit consumers to carry these plans for a full year. That means the plans will be competing for business more directly with the comprehensive insurance listed on the exchanges.
I knew the Republicans would do everything in their power to try and repeal Obamacare, Biden said in an email to supporters Monday. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it.
The awareness of structural problems in American politics, starting with the Senate, already feels stronger than it did a year ago, when Obama said all of these things to me. And the approach Democrats are taking to their COVID-19 relief bill suggests they are learning to adapt. Party leaders decided early on to use budget reconciliation, so they can pass something with 50 votes in the Senate; Republican support would be nice, they said, but they're not going to hold up legislation for it.
But that chance never came, because Republicans focused on repeal and, at times, trying to sabotage the program outright. Think about Medicare, Obama said. That was a big political fight, but once it got passed, everybody moved on and tried to make it work. Bush's drug benefit program, right? It was a contentious issue.

This is pretty terrible, Jodi Ray, who is the project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families, told HuffPost. We will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources.

Such decreases may happen whenever the government cracks down on immigrants, a new study shows.
Although McElvain has not publicly offered a reason for his resignation, the Post article said that his departure highlights internal frustration with the Trump administration's decision to support a lawsuit from officials in 20 conservative states. That lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in Texas, could wipe out key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Insistence upon these abortion restrictions undoubtedly reflects genuine policy preferences from conservatives. It also reflects a political calculation ― namely, that Republicans can't afford to alienate supporters who are strongly opposed to abortion, Obamacare, or both.
Well, it turns out that protection might disappear, along with the rest of the ACA, because Trump and the Republican Party want it to.
But reconciliation isn't a cure-all for the Senate's structural problems, especially given the strict, quirky rules about what provisions can even pass through that process. And at least for the moment, ending or even reforming the filibuster seems to be off the table.
But the transformation of the Republicans into a more ideologically and temperamentally extreme party really has changed American politics in profound ways, and Democrats really do need to adapt to that transformation if they want to succeed. That means paying attention to what went wrong with the Affordable Care Act ― although, to be clear, it also means recognizing what went right. And Obama has some ideas about that too.
I'm not going to vote for him because he and Barack are friends, said Phyllis Pelzer, 53, of Orangeburg. A lot of Black people see Biden as a good guy because he was Obama's guy, but I don't care nothing about that. All of em' got some Black friends somewhere. You can't win because you have a Black friend.
A short film of racially diverse residents of New York City's public housing system denounced the incompetence of Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio. One speaker even denounced Democrats for putting illegal immigrants before Black Americans.
Statements like these are just rhetoric. But they are consistent with a long-standing approach to policy ― promoted by conservatives, implemented by Republicans ― in which protecting the elderly and the frail has been a secondary priority, at best.
There's a fear of exposing family members, said Crystal Yang, assistant professor of law at Harvard Law School, one of the report's authors.
For weeks, Democrats have been in an internal policy debate around the issue of health insurance. House Democrats' latest relief package included several health care provisions, expanding how much the federal government chips in on Medicaid payments, and subsidizing COBRA at 100%. In other words, it would have the federal government temporarily foot the bill for the health insurance plans employers were once covering.
The message NextGen is deploying, however, is surprisingly simple. The best way to get young voters eager to pull the lever for a 77-year-old they overwhelmingly rejected in favor of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the presidential primaries is to point out his agreement with them on a host of issues. The ads don't make grandiose arguments about how Biden will unite the country but instead argue he's the best bet for progress on issues younger adults care about.
Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and a featured speaker at the South Carolina rally, told HuffPost that since the '16 primary, Sanders has built relationships [in South Carolina] and he understands the terrain.
It's very challenging to plan for your future in an environment like this, said Beth Feldpush, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at America's Essential Hospitals, a group that represents safety-net hospitals nationally.
Biden didn't name Sanders in his victory speech. But it was clear he was talking about the senator, who has surpassed Biden in national polls. Sanders is also poised to win big on Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote and one-third of the delegates deciding the Democratic nomination will be up for grabs.
Now let's talk about what Trump and his party are doing.
Even without the rare moments of honesty, however, we would know this is what Republicans want because of the simple fact that they've been trying to slash health care programs for decades.
And that, according to Biden, comes down to a race between him and Sanders.
Ever since it passed in 2010, Republicans promised to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. When Donald Trump won the White House and Republicans won control of both chambers of Congress in 2016, they finally had their chance. Voters, however, started to realize what would be lost if the law were repealed, and Obamacare suddenly became significantly more popular. Activists mobilized to protest vulnerable GOP lawmakers who had supported repeal, and health care was a top issue energizing Democratic voters.
Ahead of a political rally last Saturday, there were signs that the state remained unwelcoming terrain for Sanders. Two of the state's veteran Democratic officials carped in the press that he should get lost, arguing that the visit was unhelpful in a conservative state where the party's candidates usually compete by tacking to the center.
This week's low point, perhaps, was the president's childish tweet of an old Trump pro wrestling video, modified to show him slamming to the ground and repeatedly punching a guy whose head was a CNN logo.
For the first time in history, a congressional committee will be hearing from experts on why every American should have access to quality, affordable healthcare, sponsor of the Medicare for All legislation Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement. This hearing will continue the momentum for this deeply important issue ― an issue that people have literally been dying over while waiting for Congress to resolve ― and will surely be a catalyst for more action to come.
To accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. In theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from Alexander-Collins.
That's not all. The White House budget request this year called for $250 billion in Medicaid cuts over a decade. The House Republican budget proposal called for reviving the American Health Care Act's Medicaid cuts. And the Trump administration is encouraging states to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees, a policy designed to reduce enrollment in the program. That plan is already working as intended in Arkansas.
There's a wait-and-see feeling, said Kevin Holloran, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings. Hospitals are saying, we'll revisit this in six months or more.
Obviously, Obama said, that did not prove to be the case.
But McCaughey's claim fit the broader narrative about health care reform that the right was constructing ― namely, that the proposed legislation would limit care for the medically vulnerable. Soon Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate, made her own version of the argument.
That promise would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep if the Trump administration weakens or eliminates the mandate on its own, before a new health care system is in place.
Democrats had just passed a law spending unprecedented amounts of government money to help Americans going through an equally unprecedented crisis. Republicans almostly unanimously opposed the legislation, but opinion surveys showed a strong majority of the public had favorable views of the plan.
The problems for the Brooklyn-born Vermonter didn't end with the 2016 election. His April 2017 decision to campaign for Democrat Heath Mello, an abortion-rights opponent who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, raised eyebrows on the left.
This is playing out in Arizona, where Kingman Regional Medical Center is taking cost-cutting measures by renegotiating medical supply and service contracts. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System, which includes six hospitals, is largely holding off hiring non-clinical staff, a trend also evident in national data.
Less than 24 hours before, Trump had issued an ultimatum to the House, demanding a vote on what both he and Republican leaders had identified as a top legislative priority ― and threatening to move on to other legislative items if they refused.
Joel is a civil servant through and through ― principled, dedicated to his country and nonpartisan, Nicholas Bagley, who served at Justice from 2007 to 2010 and is now at the University of Michigan, told HuffPost. If people like him are jumping ship, it's a troubling sign of institutional rot at the Justice Department.
But it has been done before. Health insurance companies have been required to cover people with preexisting conditions ever since the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was enacted 10 years ago.
But for now, Republicans aren't interested in another health care fight.
But even as GOP presidential candidates lambasted the deal, Republican foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill understood that an international agreement that put the Iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. They passed a law that allowed Obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to Republicans who believed they needed it.
10. Chris Christie, Trump friend and Governor of New Jersey. Last week's ranking: ―
This is always the problem for Republicans. Making insurance available to everybody typically requires some combination of government spending, taxes and regulations. And these are not things Republicans want to do.
Sanctuary policies make a difference, he said. They reduce the level of fear.
Already, both sides are preparing their arguments. Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster at Public Opinion Strategies, predicted the legislation would get less popular over time as the public learned more about its non-COVID-19 provisions.
The brief was entirely consistent with President Donald Trump's long-standing hostility to the law, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress spent much of last year trying to repeal it.
Still, Biden's ability to cite the first Black president as his close personal friend poses perhaps the biggest challenge to the other candidates in South Carolina. To make inroads in the state, Biden's competitors have to effectively pull the former vice president away from Obama. On paper, it's not difficult to make that point by noting Biden's long record in government — one that was far more conservative than Obama's on issues like criminal justice reform, health care and national security.
There's a wait-and-see feeling, said Kevin Holloran, a senior director at S&P Global Ratings. Hospitals are saying, we'll revisit this in six months or more.
Given that shift in the Trump administration's policy-making lineup and Iran's threat to resume its nuclear program should the United States re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in their White House visits this week has been to persuade Trump to remain in the agreement.
The policy of the United States is an empty phrase. It's not a law. It's not even an actual policy. Also, the current real policy of the United States on this issue is encoded in a law called the Affordable Care Act that Trump is trying to get rid of.
Trump has made abortion and, more broadly, women's health care and women's rights, to be an issue in 2020, Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen told HuffPost. He was the one who, during the State of the Union, lied, deliberately spreading misinformation about abortion care and women's health care. He's the one who has made this a campaign issue. And we say: Bring it on.
Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act is actually functioning without a mandate penalty. That's one more reason to preserve the law, as a separate friend-of-the-court brief from several dozen policy experts argues.
Between the loss of tax credits and the end of Medicaid funding, 21 million people would lose insurance, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Urban Institute.
The Trump administration guidance means that it can interpret the law's rules more loosely, in ways that will effectively let people move into less comprehensive coverage ― even though that means more exposure to medical bills.
But if the lack of Democratic support was to blame for this governing debacle, Trump has no one to blame but himself.
The American Health Care Act, the Republican proposal to replace the ACA, would have amounted to arguably the single biggest rollback of a social welfare program in American history.
The bills Republicans produced that year would have weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions while leaving many millions without insurance, as independent analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office, confirmed.
Many Republicans still aren't willing to vote for any proposal that might appear to prop up Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, which they and many of their supporters would rather just repeal.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the cut late Tuesday. The cut will affect navigators, the nonprofit organizations that the federal government pays to help with enrollment in the states that use HealthCare.gov as their online marketplace for people trying to get coverage through the Affordable Care Act.
But none of that would compare to knocking out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as this new lawsuit could do.
One hint to how the Supreme Court might vote on this case comes from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who in recent rulings indicated he supports the traditional notion of severability. That might suggest he's inclined to leave the rest of the Affordable Care Act in place, even if he buys the argument that the mandate has now become unconstitutional.
The first is his claim that the entire Republican Party would always, and very strongly, protect patients with preexisting conditions. This simply isn't true. The GOP has dedicated dozens of congressional votes over the years to repealing Obamacare, including its protections blocking insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting health conditions. Trump's Justice Department supports a lawsuit aiming to strike down the entire law that is soon to go before the Supreme Court. Various Republicans have tried to introduce legislation that could replace Obamacare's protections, but health care experts have consistently said those bills would fall short of the protections the Affordable Care Act offers.
The other campaigns know what they are up against.
Sanders congratulated Biden from a rally in Virginia Beach on Saturday night, telling his supporters that you can't win them all. His campaign said it was confident in its ability to meet the threshold to win some delegates in South Carolina, but already had set its sights on Super Tuesday. Sanders spent the last week campaigning in California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Continuing, he mockingly imagined the conversation of a fictional couple excited to pay their monthly insurance premium: Oh my god, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day! Oh, wow!
Trump barely engaged in the 2017 legislative fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a GOP plan that would have kicked tens of millions of Americans off their health care. After that failed, he gave up even trying to legislate on health care, and instead, his administration turned its focus to sabotaging the ACA's health insurance marketplaces, imposing onerous new requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries, promoting the sale of junk health insurance policies that, unlike ACA plans, do exclude people with preexisting conditions, and getting the courts to kill the ACA for him.
When we get rid of those lines, you have competition and we'll be able to keep pre-existing and help people that can't get, don't have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way. Believe it or not and strongly this way. We're going to block grant. Into the states. Block grant into medicaid. So we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
As a result, some middle- and upper-income Americans are likely to see pretty big premium spikes this fall, above and beyond the usual increases, right before the midterm elections. And they may be looking for somebody to blame.
During his 40-minute remarks in South Carolina and in three speeches in Iowa later on Saturday and on Sunday in Iowa, Sanders did little to conceal that he is strongly considering another presidential run. He spent a good chunk of his time recounting how the policies he championed as a presidential candidate are now squarely in the Democratic mainstream.
Greg Ip wrote a fascinating, extremely well-researched and only marginally biased article in the Wall Street Journal entitled The Unstable Economics in Obama's Health Law. As a healthcare provider as well as an Affordable Care Act participant, I was sent this article because I have been researching possible solutions to the LOSE-LOSE-LOSE debacle that Obamacare has become.
It's very disturbing and it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular ― Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, McConnell told Bloomberg TV. Hopefully at some point here we'll get serious about this, he said. McConnell went on to lament that it was a shame Obama and Congress weren't able to figure out how to ruin these programs together and bizarrely asserted that total GOP control of the federal government somehow made this more difficult.
The news was so major that it was touted in an official White House tweet.
But once Trump made his decision and the CSR money stopped flowing, insurers in most states reacted quickly, jacking up premiums exclusively on customers who were eligible for tax credits. By design, those tax credits rise in tandem with premiums, which means those consumers didn't end up paying more out of their own pockets. They simply got bigger tax credits, which meant greater spending by the federal government.
Death Panels In The Age Of Coronavirus
Today Trump has arrived in European to represent our nation in crucial discussions with leaders of key nations. He's already insisted in a press conference in Poland that nobody really knows who hacked the U.S. election, even though the entire intelligence community told him it was Russia. With North Korea developing a missile that could deliver nuclear warheads to U.S. territory, and so many other dangers and challenges in the world, is this the man with which we are to defend America?
The benefits of restoring the CSRs, as they've come to be known, are more ambiguous than the benefits of funding reinsurance.
It's unclear how precisely that would work out because a law was enacted in 2018 to close the doughnut hole ahead of schedule. That legislation was a modification of the Affordable Care Act, and judges would have to sort out what that modification means if the ACA comes off the books.
At the flagship protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., hundreds of men and women showed up for abortion rights. Democratic presidential candidates including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg all came as well.
But Thursday, at the filing deadline for the case, the Justice Department submitted a brief that sided with the states.
How Trump Plotted To Kill Obamacare
Both parties recognize the stakes, which helps explain why the James-Peters race is on track to be the most expensive in the state's history. Much of that has gone toward television advertisements that focus on health care ― including one from Peters that features a 2017 video of James bemoaning the GOP's failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Even that figure doesn't capture the full extent of the consequences from a Supreme Court decision against the health care law.
Trump's demand was an audacious act of political brinkmanship, designed to rattle and win over dissident Republican lawmakers who, for various reasons, were objecting to the bill.
So far, he has been given a fair amount of leeway.
The Affordable Care Act originally had a reinsurance program that expired after three years. The Alexander-Collins proposal would start it up again, for another three years, reducing premiums by 10 percent on average in 2019 and by 20 percent on average in the two years after that, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future, Ryan admitted Friday. I don't know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land.
Everybody is talking about how Democrats need to avoid the traps that ensnared them during former President Barack Obama's first term, when they repeatedly got bogged down in bipartisan negotiations, made all sorts of substantive concessions on policy, and still got virtually no GOP support for their initiatives.
Following publication of this article, it came to HuffPost's attention that Harris had in fact received contributions over $200 from 14 people who appeared to be pharmaceutical executives. The Harris campaign told HuffPost it had already returned two of those donations and was in the process of returning 10 more. The campaign said it wasn't sure whether the other two are from pharmaceutical executives and is seeking clarification.
And former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ― long hailed by conservative Gothamites for his heavy-handed approach to reducing crime in the 1990s ― described de Blasio as a taste of the kind of lawlessness-for-its-own-sake that Democrats supposedly want to visit on America.
What Republicans have to do is turn it into midnight basketball, he said, referring to a program Republicans attacked as frivolous in 1990s crime legislation. You have to say you support the bits of this that go to COVID relief, but detail the pork that's in there. (In 2010, Republicans attacked a stimulus-funded study that tested how monkeys reacted to cocaine.)
Trump claimed it's never been done before.
Many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. Restoring CSR funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. The federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.
Now my Republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the American people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! he mused, drawing laughs from the crowd.
For weeks, Biden has been making the case that his candidacy would be the most strategic for Democrats, particularly that he can help Democrats win down the ballot in competitive House and Senate races. He has also argued that Sanders' democratic socialism is too big a risk for the party.
Just as Donald Trump displays the shadow side of xenophobic white America, The Wall Street Journal's choice of this particular photo with this article unconsciously displays what many Republicans think but seldom say (even David Duke doesn't publicly say it anymore): We can't trust black people. They are lazy and when given the opportunity they will bilk the system. (They make marvelous singers, dancers, and athletes, but aside from their entertainment value, they are really quite a burden on society.) That is what The Wall Street Journal tacitly told its readers when it decided to publish that particular photo with that particular article.
The Democrats today have one advantage, though. They can learn from the past. And when I asked Obama to reflect on what he and the Affordable Care Act's architects got wrong, he cited a failure to grasp the depth and duration of GOP opposition. I think what we got wrong was underestimating the degree to which political polarization had ― the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled, the former president said, adding later, I think any progressive president, on any issue for the next several years, is going to have to confront the problem that the GOP has shifted into a perpetual campaign mode.
People were led to expect an immediate and overwhelming impact of that legislation, and that as the recovery dragged on with year after year of very slow employment growth, the popularity of the bill just plummeted, said Michael Steel, a Republican operative who worked as a spokesperson for then-House Minority Leader John Boehner at the time.
And in June, he introduced legislation eliminating the use of cash bail, which a press release from his office noted disproportionately affects black, Latinx and Native American people.
A key problem with the plan is that the federal deduction for state and local income taxes would be eliminated, thereby hurting taxpayers in New York, California, or Massachusetts who pay high amounts. The residents of those and other such states would be severely hurt since their taxes are much higher than places like Florida and Texas, and would actually see a severely substantial tax increase. According to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, taxpayers using this deduction save more than $100 billion, which is actually greater than the mortgage interest deduction.

When did Aetna first inform investors that its participation in the public exchanges would be contingent upon federal government approval of its proposed acquisition of Humana? What other risks did the company disclose to investors?
This is the lowest rate that we have seen since we started keeping these records, Obama said. We're not going backwards. We're not going to go back to a time where people could be denied because of pre-existing conditions. That's not who we are. That's who we were.
The mandate is meant to encourage healthy people to buy insurance. It makes it possible for insurers to sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and not worry that people will wait until getting sick to enroll. The mandate also makes sure that people without coverage assume some financial responsibility for the charity care they would receive if they needed it.
The super PAC has also hired 150 organizers spread across 11 battleground states and is also aiming to register tens of thousands of young voters in 2020. They also created a simple fact sheet they plan to digitally pass out to voters at online organizing events, aiming to answer questions about Biden's and Trump's records.
The less generous plans that Verma and the Trump administration are touting, and that Monday's rule change will favor, frequently leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs if they get seriously sick or injured, precisely because they leave out benefits that people need when they have serious medical problems. Often, the buyers of these plans aren't even aware of the limits until it's too late, because deciphering the fine print of these plans is so difficult.
Trump Is Stuck In 1980s New York City
But the conversation covered a lot more than health care policy, because it's impossible to talk about the 2010 law without talking about the ways politics have been changing in the past decade, and how those changes affected what Democrats were and weren't able to do. In many ways, the saga of the Affordable Care Act is a case study in the challenges that progressives must overcome if they want to pass ambitious legislation ― challenges facing Democrats now just as surely as they did during Obama's tenure.
(Reuters) - Uncertainty surrounding the Republican plan to replace Obamacare is forcing someU.S. hospitals to delay expansion plans, cut costs, or take on added risk to borrow money for capital investment projects, dealing an economic blow to these facilities and the towns they call home.
There are difficult trade-offs and ambiguous medical evidence to weigh. But on one side of the argument is a group of people who act as if ― and occasionally even say ― that returning to normality requires tolerating mass deaths among some of society's most vulnerable groups.
Jonathan Ernst/Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron tried to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to remain in the Iran nuclear agreement during his White House visit this week.
Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.
We came really close today, but we came up short, Ryan said at a press conference. This is a disappointing day for us.
I wasn't pining to be on the panel, Baker said.
But here too it is easy to forget another reality of 2009 politics, one still very relevant today: The big pressure to compromise came from conservative Democrats who had leverage to kill legislation if they wanted. In the Senate, this was a function of the same small-state bias that gave Republicans outsized power, and as a practical matter, it meant that Democratic leaders were constantly trying to satisfy senators from places like Arkansas and Nebraska where voters were especially suspicious of big new federal programs and prone to believing conservative propaganda about what proposed legislation would do.
Some would end up not getting coverage at all, which is why, according to the CBO, the number of people without insurance would actually rise if the Alexander-Collins proposal became law, although the increase would be small.
This will be shocking news to Biden, who won the Democratic primary by opposing the kinds of health care reforms, like Medicare for All, that his progressive opponents favored and that also wouldn't do what Trump says they would. Instead, Biden is running on a potentially consequential but also kind of boring plan to make Obamacare coverage cheaper.
Circumstances could always change. But for now, it looks like those reservations have left the proposal without the support it needs to get through Congress ― as part of this new spending bill and, perhaps, as part of any other legislation this year.
President Donald Trump's Justice Department decided not to defend the law in court, which is not the normal way the department handles cases challenging federal laws. The administration, however, doesn't want to throw out the whole law ― just the parts that protect people with pre-existing conditions. Some Democratic state officials have stepped to take the federal government's place and fight the lawsuit.
I just think there's a higher, higher level of awareness of how multiple things in this bill can impact their lives, said John Anzalone, who polled for Biden's presidential campaign. They're going to remember how this sped up distribution of the vaccine and expedited getting kids back in school.
Coverage for preexisting conditions is already the law of the land, he said. Now, not only is he lying to you about giving you something you already have, he's actively trying to take it away, Cuomo added.
How many enrollees have contacted Aetna over its decision to withdraw from the ACA exchanges? What materials and resources is Aetna making available to assist consumers in selecting new health insurance coverage?
Clients may drop out for a host of reasons, such as frustrations with submitting paperwork, said Jared Call, the group's managing policy advocate. And as the economy improves, there's a decline in food stamp enrollment as well.
This also does not take into account all the kinds of assistance navigators provide all year, such as helping with complex cases and issues and filing appeals. Florida will definitely be hit hard by this.
There's a perception that poor people want handouts, and immigrants are lumped into that category, said Eric Rodriguez, vice president of research, advocacy and legislation for UnidosUS, formerly National Council on La Raza, an advocacy group based in Washington. He said that's not the case.
Some states will keep working to expand coverage to the uninsured and keep it affordable and adequate, [and] in other states we'll see a race to deregulate, with the result that comprehensive coverage will be more expensive for those who need it most, Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University, said.
In cities that began cooperating with Secure Communities, food stamp enrollment among immigrants dropped by 19 percent within five years, the report found. But in sanctuary cities around the country, there was no drop-off in SNAP and ACA enrollment. (The study included data from the Pew Research Center, which, like Stateline, is funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.)
Without the mandate or some other policy device to keep healthy people buying coverage, most experts say insurers would have to charge everybody else even more ― and, partly as a consequence, fewer people would end up having insurance.
But there is no way to be sure, especially because her answer left some observers thinking she might agree with the plaintiffs on the rest of the argument.
But, she's 99% committed to Biden.
More than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, meaning millions will be left without health insurance. In mid May, left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute estimated 16.2 million people have lost health insurance once provided by their employer — how roughly half of Americans get their health insurance. That number could be as high as 26.8 million if those who lost their jobs don't sign up for other coverage, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.
It's time for the navigator program to evolve, Seema Verma, the CMS administrator, said in a press release that cited the success of commercial brokers in enrolling individuals and stressed the importance of spending federal funds more judiciously.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said first lady Melania Trump attended the service. She did not.
But the gambit failed, and it failed spectacularly.
There's a lot of things at play right now that are not left or right ― they're Iowa issues, he said. It's our tariffs, it's these farmlands all around us.
But some experts supported the decision and, just two years later, the Supreme Court would invalidate DOMA as unconstitutional.
Trump's call-in on a 2014 Fox & Friends episode, which was posted Thursday by Raw Story, appears to reveal his willingness to tolerate almost any disaster to get what he wants.
Trump said he agreed to pulling the bill once Ryan made it clear the legislation lacked the votes to pass.
The Paycheck Protection Program gives employers loans primarily to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic. Collins is part of a bipartisan push advocating an extension of these loans.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday released her version of Medicare for All, a plan to create a new, government-run insurance plan designed to cover all Americans and pay for nearly all their medical expenses. The proposal would likely eliminate existing employer-sponsored plans, over the course of a decadelong transition, but allow private insurers to offer an alternative form of coverage, much as they do today for seniors on Medicare.
The phrase death panels became part of America's political vocabulary in 2009, when Republicans were trying to stop the legislation that eventually became the Affordable Care Act.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Visitors to the Department of Labor March 18 are turned away at the door by personnel due to closures over coronavirus concerns in New York. A record-high number of people applied for unemployment benefits as layoffs engulfed the United States.
Democrats believe the GOP's aggressive push for these sorts of laws may backfire, just as their yearslong campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act did in the 2018 elections.
Not all hospitals are on hold. Some healthcare groups in areas with growing populations, such as Atlanta and Houston, are pushing ahead with capital expansion projects. Others, such as Maryland's Prince George's County, are still planning to move forward with construction plans, thanks in part to a partnership with the University of Maryland Medical System.
A proposal designed to stabilize Obamacare and reduce health insurance premiums for some Americans seems unlikely to become law anytime soon.
This new guidance allows states to set up parallel insurance markets that may be able to attract healthy people with plans that have lower premiums but fewer consumer protections, leaving ACA plans with a sicker pool and higher premiums, Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost on Monday.
I saw the same thing about 15 years ago, and then all of a sudden he walked into the office, McCallum said in his sermon. This young man by the name of Barack Obama said, 'Yes we can.' I'm here to say we will.
Those of us who are 70-plus, we'll take care of ourselves, but don't sacrifice the country, he said, adding that he was not living in fear of COVID-19. What I'm living in fear of is what's happening to this country.
Surprised? Don't be. Gingrich's plan to let traditional Medicare wither on the vine, as he put in 1996, is more than 20 years old. Ryan may be retiring from Congress after the upcoming election, but his 2012 plan (and the various versions of it created since then) to slash Medicare and replace it with a voucher system remains popular among fellow GOP politicians, even though they tend to hide this during election years. Or even straight-up lie about it.
As the Trump administration has stepped up deportations and workplace raids around the country, there's been a drop at the Spanish Catholic Center in all immigrants applying for food stamps, said case manager Rodrigo Aguirre. Many fill in the gaps by picking up bags of donated groceries from the center's food pantry.
What is the price of a human life, Mister Ip? If your son or daughter needed a million dollars worth of brain surgery this week to survive, I am sure you could pass the hat around to your fellow white co-workers at the Wall Street Journal and raise your $12,000 deductible or maximum out-of-pocket costs, but could the average minority in America do the same?
The good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million Americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, Cornyn said in a PBS Austin interview. As you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. So that's an option for people.
9. James Mattis, Secretary of Defense, and H.R. McMaster, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Last week's ranking: ―
Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in December: I'll be proud to shut down the government for border security. He subsequently refused to sign a federal spending bill unless he was allocated $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. On Thursday, a joint statement from unions representing pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers said the risk to air safety of the partial government shutdown was incalculable and unprecedented.
President Donald Trump's promised breakthrough in health care coverage looks like it could be insurance protection for preexisting conditions. One sticking point: It's already guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act — which his administration is fighting to kill in the Supreme Court.
President Donald Trump really, really wants to fool voters into thinking he has a plan to make the health care system great again. But he really, really doesn't.
I am half-Black and President Obama was half-Black and I know when I see a Black person and a white person who can genuinely get along with one another, she said.
Among those who fought hardest against the Republicans' repeal efforts were organizations representing people with disabilities, people with serious diseases and the elderly.
This issue is essentially a health care issue, said Kim Baker, a co-chair with Indivisible Midlands (SC2), which is also fighting at the state level to stop the legislature from restricting abortion rights. Then you bring in the extra attacks on women's autonomy and reproductive rights, and I think it will be a very big issue going into the 2020 elections.
Next year, navigators from across the country will have to apply and compete for a total of $10 million in funds. That's down from $37 million for the 2018 plan year and from $63 million for 2017. The Trump administration has made similarly sharp reductions in funds earmarked for advertising and promoting health insurance enrollment.
Surprise bills are one of the worst aspects of the U.S. health care system, and that's really saying something considering how awful it is in so many other ways. Over the past couple of years, Congress has tried and failed to devise a solution to this problem that would protect patients from unexpected bills from out-of-network providers the patients often don't even know treated them.
The Iran deal is just one instance where Trump's not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.
Voters' support for abortion rights is at a record high, said Cecile Richards, the former head of Planned Parenthood who recently co-founded Supermajority, a group devoted to women's political power. Meanwhile, we're seeing the most extreme attacks on those rights since Roe v. Wade more than 40 years ago. .... Women are voting in record numbers, donating in record numbers, sharing their stories, and organizing. Women are becoming the most powerful political force in America, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020.
And the Obamacare issue raged on--this time with Neville Chamberlain making a guest appearance, an acting black hole who probably sucked the blood right out of Lord Grantham's ulcer.
Later Trump suggested that Clinton's solution, providing more financial assistance to people with higher expenses, was a bad idea because the country already has almost $20 trillion in debt. But Clinton has called for raising taxes on wealthy Americans in order to pay for her new initiatives, including the proposed health care assistance, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ― an independent organization that is obsessive about reducing the deficit ― has concluded she's identified enough specific revenue to pay for nearly her entire agenda.
Here's what she said about Obamacare in 2009:
Some polling shows younger Black voters have been more receptive to the policy message from candidates. A Washington Post/Ipsos poll in early January showed Biden polling at 48% with Black voters and Sanders second with 20% support, driven primarily by supporters under the age of 35. But even that poses its own electoral hurdle; in 2008, a year known for its focus on young voters, voters under the age of 29 made up just 14% of the electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary.
We're eyes wide open to the fact that when it's signed, we can't just cease our communication efforts, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who helped lead communications efforts around the stimulus bill, told HuffPost in an interview. I think it'll be different than what we did with the [2009 stimulus].
A Pelosi spokesman, Henry Connelly, also said in a statement that the Rules Committee had free rein to choose whichever witnesses they wanted to articulate the strongest case for Medicare For All.
Maybe Winston Churchill can be a future guest and the Dowager Countess will be the one who pushes him to return England to the Gold Standard, which will plunge England into chaos. Talk about tradition!
That said, Sarah Miller, a health economist with University of Michigan, pointed out there are still real financial and health impacts.
In his rollout of a health care plan on Monday that would create a public option for people to buy into Medicare, Biden described Medicare for All as both an attack on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and traditional Medicare.
Researchers looked at Latino enrollment in food stamps between 2006 and 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. They found that after the federal government began stepping up deportation efforts, Latino immigrant enrollment in SNAP and the ACA dropped. (The ACA wasn't passed until 2010, and went into effect in 2014.)
There are difficult trade-offs and ambiguous medical evidence to weigh. But on one side of the argument is a group of people who act as if ― and occasionally even say ― that returning to normality requires tolerating mass deaths among some of society's most vulnerable groups.
They are allowing insurers to sell more so-called short-term policies, which insurers can refuse to sell to people with pre-existing conditions. They want to permit states to set aside the ACA's insurance regulations and set up new markets for policies that people with pre-existing conditions can't buy. At the state level, Iowa and Tennessee already have parallel insurance markets that allow insurers to turn away people with pre-existing conditions, and Idaho wants to join them.
The law gives the Department of Health and Human Services broad discretion to grant hardship exemptions to people who say they can't afford the mandate. There are signs that the Trump administration intends to use that leeway to minimize the penalty's impact, in ways that go beyond what the Obama administration did.
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Sanders and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) walked with Rev. William Barber of North Carolina, a civil rights leader, during a Capitol Hill protest in 2017 of the GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. Barber ended up being arrested.
Under the lran deal legislation passed by Congress, Trump must certify every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of U.S. sanctions. Trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. Last October, he refused to certify that Iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, May 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.
Hard Things Are Hard; Better Is Good
And not all Americans will qualify for Medicaid, the public health program for low-income Americans.
Former Vice President Joe Biden declared his overwhelming victory in the South Carolina primary with a forceful message for Democrats: that the party would lose big if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the Democratic nomination.
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), one of the officials who brought the lawsuit, is running for Senate — which the state's Sen. Joe Manchin (D) never tires of bringing up. Likewise, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) also is more than happy to talk about how her opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley (R), also one of the leaders in that case.
Whether she's weighed the ups and downs of the law appropriately, whether her sometimes vague proposals would improve access to health care at a reasonable price ― these are subjective questions, about which reasonable people can disagree. But the facts she cited on Sunday night were correct, and she's outlined her policy plans clearly, if not always with much detail.
Republicans have tried highlighting some specific projects ― they attacked a bridge in upstate New York and funding for a subway system in California as pet projects for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before both items were stripped from the bill for parliamentary reasons ― but have generally made broader critiques, often arguing that only 9% of the bill's spending goes toward COVID-19 relief. (That charge is overstated at best, since $1,400 checks make up more than one-fifth of the bill's total spending.)
Denver Health is not alone. Across the country, hospitals are shifting to a more conservative stance as they await sweeping changes to the nation's healthcare law that for the first time in U.S. history would reverse a government healthcare entitlement program. The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, provided coverage to 20 million Americans and brought higher revenues to many hospitals.
The mandate was always among the law's most controversial features and was the basis for the first legal challenge, which suggested Congress lacked authority to impose such a requirement. The court rejected that lawsuit, with Chief Justice John Roberts leading a 5-4 majority, on the theory that the financial penalty was simply a tax and Congress has the power to impose taxes.
In 2017, Congress reduced the penalty to zero, as part of the Republican tax cut bill that Trump signed. Twenty Republican state officials then filed a new lawsuit, arguing that if the penalty was zero, the mandate ― whose language remains part of the statute ― can no longer be a tax.
Scott Huffmon, a pollster with Winthrop University in South Carolina, emphasizes the importance of trust among Black voters in South Carolina.
Trump Sees China As Joe Biden's Weak Point
A spokesman with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, declined to comment.
If the action against Obamacare by Trump's DOJ succeeds, some 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance amid the COVID-19 crisis.
No one will be safe in Biden's America, Trump said in the closest thing the 70-minute speech had to a summary.
The president is declaring that it is the policy of the United States to provide protections to ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions are protected regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and its protections for preexisting conditions invalidated, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a conference call with reporters prior to Trump's speech.
Overall, however, the mood was notably more subdued than past gatherings. After eight years out of power in the White House, attendees seemed thrilled to have finally reached the mountaintop. But, as even the organizers conceded, they still didn't know what to make of the sherpa.
Sanders' rivals in the Democratic primary are already in compliance with key elements of his pledge. All 24 Democratic candidates have rejected corporate PAC money of all kinds; 14 of them, including the leaders in the polls, have also renounced contributions from federal lobbyists.

The super PAC has also hired 150 organizers spread across 11 battleground states and is also aiming to register tens of thousands of young voters in 2020. They also created a simple fact sheet they plan to digitally pass out to voters at online organizing events, aiming to answer questions about Biden's and Trump's records.
Monday's announcement represents the latest in a series of GOP efforts to accomplish through regulation what Republicans could not accomplish through legislation when they tried, and just barely failed, to pass legislation that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act outright.
On Tuesday, CMS justified its decision based on the navigator programs' results ― in particular, the fact that, according to official statistics, less than 1 percent of people signing up for plans on HealthCare.gov had enrolled through a navigator.
But the most telling part of Trump's answer was when he described his alternative. After making the case for allowing cross-state purchase of insurance ― which would potentially lower premiums, but only by allowing insurers to escape existing regulations on benefits and sales practices ― Trump said the following:
Health care remains the No. 1 issue for voters, according to public opinion polling, and Republicans remain on the defensive following a Democratic midterm romp.
Finally, Trump said at a White House Unleashing American Energy event that he planned to cancel Obama-era limits on U.S. financing for overseas coal projects and that he would accelerate efforts to effectively turn American communities into energy colonies mined for fossil fuels to export overseas. We have nearly 100 years' worth of natural gas and more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal, Trump said. We will be dominant. We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe. Trump is selling the idea of clean coal at a time when even litigious coal baron and Trump booster Bob Murray admits that the process of trying to make clean coal through the process of carbon capture and sequestration does not work.
The generous explanation for these positions is that Republicans and their supporters have a principled opposition to government, for reasons that are philosophical, practical or both. The not-so-generous explanation is the suffering of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and meatpacking plant workers, simply doesn't matter that much.
The news was first reported by Robert Costa of The Washington Post, who spoke to the president directly, following a meeting between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).
The Trump administration's decision and, now, McElvain's departure have some experts worried about the future of the Justice Department, which historically has tried to insulate these sort of legal functions from partisanship and political meddling from above.
The awareness of structural problems in American politics, starting with the Senate, already feels stronger than it did a year ago, when Obama said all of these things to me. And the approach Democrats are taking to their COVID-19 relief bill suggests they are learning to adapt. Party leaders decided early on to use budget reconciliation, so they can pass something with 50 votes in the Senate; Republican support would be nice, they said, but they're not going to hold up legislation for it.
I think the important thing is that people have a choice in their selection of a plan, added Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the opinion, said that the Trump administration had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
The problem with this argument is that Congress last year made a clear decision to keep the protections but toss the mandate. The lawsuit essentially argues that this more recent action doesn't matter.
What remains intact are deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, the two most popular among American taxpayers. Touching these deductions would most likely hurt the housing market and home values, and non-profit organizations relying on donations to survive.
Clinton gave a nuanced response. The Democratic nominee sketched out what she believes are the Affordable Care Act's strengths and weaknesses, vowing to address the latter with a series of modest changes that she'd outlined previously in her speeches and writings.
The debut of this phony bill Friday is the latest installment in Republicans' long-running campaign to make the health care system worse for anyone who has ever been sick while loudly proclaiming they are doing the opposite.
President Donald Trump really, really wants to fool voters into thinking he has a plan to make the health care system great again. But he really, really doesn't.
As the Trump administration has stepped up deportations and workplace raids around the country, there's been a drop at the Spanish Catholic Center in all immigrants applying for food stamps, said case manager Rodrigo Aguirre. Many fill in the gaps by picking up bags of donated groceries from the center's food pantry.
The proof is in the rhetoric of Republicans, who claim to support these goals as much as Democrats do, while promising supposedly better alternatives they've never been able to pass as legislation.
But the transformation of the Republicans into a more ideologically and temperamentally extreme party really has changed American politics in profound ways, and Democrats really do need to adapt to that transformation if they want to succeed. That means paying attention to what went wrong with the Affordable Care Act ― although, to be clear, it also means recognizing what went right. And Obama has some ideas about that too.
With the new medical center, Prince George's County hopes to end its long-time reliance on $30 million annually from public subsidies to help cover operations. But that goal assumed Obamacare would remain intact, said Thomas Himler, Prince George's deputy chief administrative officer.
Washington Republicans, meanwhile, predict a replay. They argue the legislation's popularity will drop as voters are exposed to less popular aspects of the law, and suggest it won't serve as the economic rocket ship Democrats are expecting.
Given that shift in the Trump administration's policy-making lineup and Iran's threat to resume its nuclear program should the United States re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in their White House visits this week has been to persuade Trump to remain in the agreement.
The savings from this new cut account for less than half a percent of what the federal government is expected to spend to subsidized private coverage and Medicaid next year.
The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare, he explained. This is not our bill. This is their bill.
One of the most shocking things I found in this bill, and there were many, is on page 425, where the Congress would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years, people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner ... all to do what's in society's best interest or your family's best interest and cut your life short. These are such sacred issues of life and death. Government should have nothing to do with this.
In addition, the focus on New York City was bizarre. Notwithstanding an uptick in crime, including shootings and murders in recent months, New York City does not even break the top 25 most crime-ridden big cities. And though the city is in the grips of an uptick in crime that is cause for local concern, the Big Apple is on track to have far fewer violent crimes this year than it did under Giuliani.
There's great demand that we're concerned about not being able to meet in the future, said Burnette.
The mandate has been credited with significantly reducing birth control costs across the country. Before the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, contraceptives made up about 30% of women's total out-of-pocket health care costs, according to the National Women's Law Center. In 2013, the mandate saved women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills.
It's almost impossible to wrap your brain around how this would actually work, Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University, told HuffPost. It's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not.
I'm hoping this next episode they'll discover a roof leak, moles in the beautiful lawns, poachers, and maybe even a stolen snuff box which will bring the show full circle!
She also said on Tuesday that she would not raise middle class taxes to pay for the program.
Behind a belief in the necessity of bipartisanship was a faith that it was possible ― a notion that didn't seem as preposterous then as it does now.
Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in December: I'll be proud to shut down the government for border security. He subsequently refused to sign a federal spending bill unless he was allocated $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. On Thursday, a joint statement from unions representing pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers said the risk to air safety of the partial government shutdown was incalculable and unprecedented.
Two of Obama's favorite sayings are hard things are hard and better is good. Both apply in this case, and today's Democrats would do well to keep them both in mind.
Don Polite, 28, of Columbia, said he was supporting Warren after seeing her policy team emphasize Black women. Early in the campaign, several Black activist communities praised Warren's plans for addressing racial inequality head-on.
I have met with people whose first position is that they support Joe Biden but when I asked them kindly, warmly, please share with me some policies of his that you support ...they don't know, said Shaun King, a civil rights activist and surrogate for Sanders' campaign.
Making sure people who have pre-existing health conditions don't get screwed by health insurance companies is very popular. So popular that a bunch of Republican senators who are freaked out about the party's electoral prospects have introduced legislation to guarantee that no Americans may be denied coverage because of their medical history.
At the same time, the White House largely moved on to other things after passing the stimulus legislation. The conversation in Congress turned to the health care reform effort that would eventually become Obamacare. And while economists broadly came to realize that even the then-unprecedented $787 billion stimulus law wasn't enough to jump-start the economy, unified Republican opposition and defections from conservative Democrats prevented the White House from passing a second piece of legislation aimed at creating jobs.
As millions of Americans slip into unemployment and lose their health insurance during a public health crisis, Senate Republicans still see no need to act on health care.
But here too it is easy to forget another reality of 2009 politics, one still very relevant today: The big pressure to compromise came from conservative Democrats who had leverage to kill legislation if they wanted. In the Senate, this was a function of the same small-state bias that gave Republicans outsized power, and as a practical matter, it meant that Democratic leaders were constantly trying to satisfy senators from places like Arkansas and Nebraska where voters were especially suspicious of big new federal programs and prone to believing conservative propaganda about what proposed legislation would do.
I imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in South Carolina in a very different way. Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party
The divisions between the candidates will likely be on display on Tuesday and Wednesday in Detroit for the second presidential debate. Sanders and his fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) take the stage the first night, while Harris and Biden will get a chance to square off against each other on the second night.
Bossert is in charge of defending Americans against violence ― not lavishing praise on Trump when he broadcasts a violent revenge fantasy against our country's free press. Disgraceful.
But since November's election, when Republicans swept the White House and Congress, Denver Health has deferred $73.7 million-worth of construction projects that had been planned to serve more low-income residents, many of whom were newly insured under Obamacare.
Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, shot back on Wednesday, suggesting it was unrealistic. Without unicorns, magic wands ... health care is not free, he said on MSNBC.
Those fees, he argued, are nothing less than taxes on the middle class.
A New York Times/Siena poll out Monday showed him trailing Peters by just 1 percentage point, 42% to 43%. It's only the latest poll to suggest the race is close, even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has maintained a relatively comfortable lead in Michigan.
They succeeded. The Affordable Care Act, for all of its inadequacies and flaws, helped tens of millions of those Americans get care. A big reason Republican efforts to repeal the law failed was that it would have rolled back this progress.
Welcome to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. In a warm-up for an anticipated second run by Sanders, he's been promoting the party's prospects in the Nov. 6 elections during a nine-state campaign swing that began in Bloomington, Indiana, on Oct. 19 and wraps up in Oakland, California, this Saturday. He'll be joined on that last stop by Rep. Barbara Lee of California, a fellow progressive stalwart running for chair of the House Democratic Caucus.
To celebrate our nation, Republic Report planned to take an Independence Day break from Trump Team Disgracefulness Power Rankings, but by Sunday morning, when Rock 'Em Sock 'Em POTUS tried to knock CNN's block off, we were so deep into another week of Trump team disgracefulness that we had to punch through.
The American Health Care Act, the Republican proposal to replace the ACA, would have amounted to arguably the single biggest rollback of a social welfare program in American history.
And then there would be effects that have nothing to do with health insurance. The law is the reason that restaurant chains must post calorie counts on their menus, for example. It modified the Indian Health Service and changed the approval process for so-called biosimilar drugs.
The ads will start running on June 1 in the presidential battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina. NextGen has purchased advertising space on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Pandora and Steam.
During the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency, Trump had promised not just to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but to replace it with great health care and insurance for everybody. But when the Congressional Budget Office analyzed an early version of the GOP proposal, it predicted the number of people without insurance would increase by 24 million over the next decade, going up by 14 million in 2018 alone.
In fact, although Verma said a major goal of Monday's guidance was to give states more flexibility, the guidance states explicitly that state waiver applications should foster health coverage through competitive private coverage... over public programs.
A spokesman with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, declined to comment.
But once Trump made his decision and the CSR money stopped flowing, insurers in most states reacted quickly, jacking up premiums exclusively on customers who were eligible for tax credits. By design, those tax credits rise in tandem with premiums, which means those consumers didn't end up paying more out of their own pockets. They simply got bigger tax credits, which meant greater spending by the federal government.
The most potent symbol of how they pivoted away from jobs was that they put then-Vice President Joe Biden in charge of it, he said.
Obama also said future Democrats need to make different policy design decisions. Specifically, he said, they should expect no more cooperation for implementing their reforms than he got for the Affordable Care Act ― although, he warned, without such cooperation, making government programs work is bound to be a lot more difficult:
I knew the Republicans would do everything in their power to try and repeal Obamacare, Biden said in an email to supporters Monday. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it.
While the Rules Committee and Pelosi's staff contest leadership's role in choosing witnesses, sources close to the process insist Primus was intimately involved.
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), one of the officials who brought the lawsuit, is running for Senate — which the state's Sen. Joe Manchin (D) never tires of bringing up. Likewise, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) also is more than happy to talk about how her opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley (R), also one of the leaders in that case.
Under the judgment, between 70,500 and 126,400 women could lose access to no-cost birth control, according to government estimates.
And GOP presidential candidates like Donald Trump continue to call for Obamacare's repeal and replacement with other policies that wouldn't provide coverage to those who gained insurance because of the ACA, and could even result in larger numbers of uninsured than before Obama's reforms took effect.
This trend gives Obama something to boast about when it comes to his signature domestic achievement, but the Affordable Care Act still faces considerable challenges in the next few years that could jeopardize these gains in coverage. Obama has floated policies to fix some, but not all, of the problems with the law.
If you're caught in an insurance trap, where COBRA is too expensive, you live in a state that didn't expand Medicaid, and aren't eligible for subsidized private insurance through Obamacare, what happens when you need to go to the ER, Miller asked rhetorically: You lose your labor market income and you can potentially face some financial hits if you need necessary medical care — you go to the ER — that can have an impact on your credit score.
Sitting in the front, Biden was a newcomer here at Bethlehem Baptist Church. But Rev. Anthony McCallum, an early endorser of Obama's in 2007, had already called him family. On Sunday he told his congregation that he sees in Biden what he saw in Obama, to roaring cheers.
WASHINGTON ― As Republicans in 2016 hammered then-President Barack Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran, their party's foreign policy leaders and even many of the GOP candidates themselves understood that the deal, while not ideal, was worth keeping.
The situation is a LOSS for healthcare workers, a LOSS for most consumers, and a LOSS (allegedly) for Aetna, Blue Shield and most other insurance companies who are threatening to leave the exchanges because they are no longer earning enough money. Hey, nobody is intentionally trying to sabotage Obamacare and make the first black president look bad - right?
Right there in the text, it says health insurance companies would not be allowed to deny an individual coverage or charge extra because of health status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, [or] any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services].
In fact, the agreement has forced Iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. The $1.7 billion the United States gave to Iran was money it held in U.S. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by U.S. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.

Just hours after his inauguration on Friday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the HHS to waive, defer, grant exemptions from taxes and penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act.
8. Thomas Bossert, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Last week's ranking: ―
A president whose primary health policy objective is scrapping his predecessor's law that brought the uninsured rate to a historic low can't plausibly claim to be fixing the health care system. Obamacare is bad is not a policy, and anyone who expected Trump to finally, at long last, explain to the public how he would replace that law ― if such a person still exists ― has been disappointed yet again.
Republicans have tried highlighting some specific projects ― they attacked a bridge in upstate New York and funding for a subway system in California as pet projects for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before both items were stripped from the bill for parliamentary reasons ― but have generally made broader critiques, often arguing that only 9% of the bill's spending goes toward COVID-19 relief. (That charge is overstated at best, since $1,400 checks make up more than one-fifth of the bill's total spending.)
Harris has repeatedly backtracked on whether she supports the most controversial elements of Sanders' plan: forcing Americans off of their private insurance and into the expanded Medicare program; and raising middle class taxes to finance the new program.
His return-to-greatness vision came as he and the Fox panel blasted Obamacare as a freebie for those who don't want to work. Obamacare isn't free, and recipients pay premiums.
McElvain was one of those career Justice lawyers who withdrew from the case. And now he has decided to leave the department entirely.
Of course, Trump probably had no idea, either.
Let's get this out of the way first: Democrats don't have to do anything to protect people with pre-existing conditions because they already did. That law is called the Affordable Care Act, it includes an ironclad guarantee that no one can be turned down for health insurance regardless of their medical histories, and then-President Barack Obama signed it on March 23, 2010.
Whether the upsides of the Alexander-Collins package justify its downsides has been the subject of increasingly intense debate among Democrats and progressive analysts in the last few weeks. Families USA, a liberal organization and prominent advocate for coverage expansions, actually came out in opposition to the bill.
The deal was achieved by Obama. The Republican primary voting base hated Obama. Anything Obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.
The situation is a LOSS for healthcare workers, a LOSS for most consumers, and a LOSS (allegedly) for Aetna, Blue Shield and most other insurance companies who are threatening to leave the exchanges because they are no longer earning enough money. Hey, nobody is intentionally trying to sabotage Obamacare and make the first black president look bad - right?
That vow, not to support a plan that pulls the rug out from under people, may sound familiar. It's the same promise Republicans kept making in 2017 after Donald Trump became president and they were trying to write repeal legislation.
The idea was to make sure healthy people enrolled before they got sick, so they would have protection against bills, so that they wouldn't require charity care that would raise costs throughout the system, and so that insurers could keep premiums low and stable.
In response to questions about there not being a true Medicare for All advocate on the panel, the Rules Committee pointed to Baker and sent a NowThis video of Nahvi endorsing single-payer health care. (Nahvi also wrote an op-ed in The Guardian that speaks positively about single-payer.)
In his rollout of a health care plan on Monday that would create a public option for people to buy into Medicare, Biden described Medicare for All as both an attack on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and traditional Medicare.
The energy we saw around this day of action was even bigger than what we saw in the early days of Kavanaugh because what we said then is becoming real to people, which is: They're going for broke, said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. And that doesn't mean just overturning Roe. It means criminalizing abortion, challenging rape, trying to control women. Women all over the country see that as a very real threat now.
He concluded his remarks on an optimistic note, citing Americans' long history of overcoming prejudice and hatred.
They are allowing insurers to sell more so-called short-term policies, which insurers can refuse to sell to people with pre-existing conditions. They want to permit states to set aside the ACA's insurance regulations and set up new markets for policies that people with pre-existing conditions can't buy. At the state level, Iowa and Tennessee already have parallel insurance markets that allow insurers to turn away people with pre-existing conditions, and Idaho wants to join them.
So in that context, it makes sense that these senators would want to have a bill they can cite as evidence that they don't think people with pre-existing conditions should be excluded from the health care system. The legislation doesn't actually do that, but it's enough for a campaign ad.
We're eyes wide open to the fact that when it's signed, we can't just cease our communication efforts, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who helped lead communications efforts around the stimulus bill, told HuffPost in an interview. I think it'll be different than what we did with the [2009 stimulus].
Biden's campaign ― which has been holding out hope that a big win in South Carolina would give the former vice president the momentum he needs to win in states across the country ― has said from the beginning that it's important to restore the soul of the nation against Donald Trump's administration. On Saturday, Biden rephrased: His campaign also wants this election to be about the soul of the Democratic Party.
They probably would have looked at it and thought: What's best for the country? he said. I don't know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.
