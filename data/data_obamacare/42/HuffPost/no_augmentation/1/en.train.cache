lynch is more conservative than wu. he has defended trump, voted against obamacare and described himself as pro-life, though he says he supports roe v. wade. lynch has the strong backing of labor unions (he was the president of the iron workers union), which is crucial in massachusetts.
conveniently for him and other republicans, no high court ruling on this will come until after november's election.
yuri gripas / reuters house democratic whip steny hoyer (md.), left, speaks next to house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) at a news conference after republicans pulled their obamacare replacement bill.
huffpost's jen bendery noted on twitter that the two senators who could decide kavanaugh's fate ― sens. susan collins (r-maine) and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) ― have both voted to confirm all of president donald trump's other anti-abortion judges.
what is the usual name for the sauce/condiment that is, in its traditional french (and most common) version, effectively a garlic mayonnaise? its name is a provençal portmanteau for its two main ingredients. (note: diaeresis is not required.) (aioli)
officials in different parts of the country have already taken or are considering such action, as a recent survey published by the commonwealth fund demonstrated. massachusetts, new york and new jersey have more or less prohibited short-term plans altogether. maryland, vermont and hawaii have limited them severely.
the rule change was among a number of ways the trump administration has tried to weaken the health care law after failing to repeal it in congress in 2017, including repealing its individual mandate and imposing work requirements on medicaid recipients.
for his part, walker — a preacher's son who is known to wear camouflage hunting gear and ride harley-davidson motorcycles — isn't a thrill-ride of a candidate either. (the capital times, the major newspaper in madison, recently dubbed the governor's race a battle of bland vs. bland. in the story, evers said in the early '80s, he and his wife belonged to the lions club together and did all that kind of crazy stuff.)
kavanaugh just said he stands by his answer.
first, the poll makes clear why health care has featured so prominently in the primary campaign: 83% of democratic voters view the issue as very important, more than any other issue, including climate change (76%) and immigration (69%).
mike lux, a progressive consultant who has endorsed warren, suggested that she should welcome a competition with buttigieg.
the justice department for 45 years has taken the position that the timing of the criminal process should be after the president leaves office, he said, adding: now, that doesn't include accumulation of evidence.
congress rendered the affordable care act completely unconstitutional in 2017 by eliminating an unpopular tax penalty for not having insurance, the administration and gop states told the court.
while idaho has not reopened its health insurance exchange, your health idaho, the state is urging uninsured consumers to buy one of the state's so-called enhanced short-term plans.
the trump administration on wednesday finalized yet another set of new health insurance rules as part of its ongoing effort to roll back the affordable care act's consumer protections and restore the kind of market conditions that existed before the law took effect.
the charge was absurd. the statutory language creating ipab explicitly forbids it from imposing changes that would amount to rationing of care. it also forbids ipab from reducing medicare benefits. in other words, ipab can't reduce medicare spending by requiring seniors to pay higher copays or scaling back the services that the program covers. instead, ipab must focus on cuts that affect the providers and suppliers of medical care ― like having medicare pay less for cataract surgery, ct scans or outpatient cancer drugs.
chaffetz's decision to run against mccarthy was a bit surprising to the majority leader. chaffetz was the keynote speaker for his re-election kickoff less than five months earlier, and he considered chaffetz a friend. but once chaffetz was in the race, he was relentless, even suggesting that mccarthy was incompetent. he told republicans they needed a speaker who could speak.
the new bill is also winning praise from representatives of the disability rights community, who worked closely with sanders on crafting the provisions for home- and community-based services ― which, today, are typically available only for people whose low incomes qualify them for medicaid, and even then only on a limited basis. previous versions of the sanders bill did not include this coverage.
corporate stakeholders pursue the business ethic seeking maximal revenue well beyond the service tradition.
for instance, a penn state study found that they could use twitter data to predict the likelihood that someone would enrol on obamacare, whilst another trawled social media to predict when someone might be tempted to join is.
his gender-neutral approach to family-friendly policies is also tremendously positive because it underscores that, for families and communities to thrive, we must recognize that caregiving is not just a women's issue, said ness.
some members of congress have spoken up on behalf of toys r us employees. moulton is not one of them.
the ambitious abrams, who famously used an excel spreadsheet to plan out her life ― including a 2028 presidential run ― has always wanted to be governor of georgia but isn't ruling out a senate bid. her team is in nearly constant contact with emily's list, which heavily backed her 2018 run. she has launched fair fight georgia, a group that she said will will pursue accountability in georgia's elections and integrity in the process of maintaining our voting rolls. the group has already filed a major lawsuit against the state and aired a super bowl ad focused on voter rights.
state law requires a counseling session with a physician, who flies in on mondays, and then a 72-hour waiting period (no more, no less) during which time the patients often sleep in their cars to save on a hotel room, says joffe, who has studied women's abortion experiences in that state. on thursday the doctor flies back in for the procedure. but should that doctor not make it that day — winter snowstorms in south dakota are common — the whole process must begin again, because the state law requires that the doctor who performs the abortion must be the same as the one who conducted the counseling session.
, slightly less than , and over (whose citizens might want to pick up the phone and call their members of congress immediately to oppose the republican plan). 14 million is 130 times the size of a capacity crowd in the nation's largest football stadium, michigan stadium (a state in which continuing the (aca) medicaid expansion in 2017 and beyond will have clear economic benefits for the state, according to a new england journal of medicine article by john z. ayanian, m.d.)
the release of the poll is part of the multipronged offensive that aarp is mounting against house republicans' health care bill. the mammoth seniors organization represents americans 50 and older and has 38 million members.
only sen. susan collins (r-maine), who voted against repealing obamacare in 2017, criticized the justice department's decision to argue in court that the entire law should be struck down as unconstitutional.
even during this terrible crisis, donald trump and republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people's health insurance, barkan said in a speech relayed from his home in california. we must elect joe biden. ... and then, with a compassionate and intelligent president, we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve.
along the way, the nuns will also lobby members of congress, meet with social service agencies dealing with budget cuts and hold town halls to hear how the tax cuts are impacting communities.
the article reads like a political speech. the president claimed that shortcomings of the law were due to lack of funding, excessive oversight, and relentless litigation by the republicans. he also took special interests to the woodshed especially the pharmaceutical industry which opposes any change to drug pricing no matter how justifiable and modest, because they believe it threatens their profits. talk about a straw man.
but there's one place where it could make a difference: collins' political career.
most of the surveys find significant splits across party lines. in the fox survey, for instance, 89 percent of republican voters, but just 7 percent of democratic voters, support the plan; in surveymonkey's poll, those numbers are 84 percent and 10 percent, respectively, while morning consult and politico find a relatively modest 65 percent to 30 percent split.
she added the members are also more selective when making medical decisions because they personally know who is helping pay for it.
absent clarity on the subsidies, insurance companies may be reluctant to participate in the exchanges next year or, at a minimum, may request very high rate increases in order to cover their losses if the payments don't continue. this could destabilize the troubled market just as analysts like standard & poor's believe it may be righting itself.
and who is behind it all?
and yet it is not donald trump who best captures the party's sickness. it is that the only possible alternative in the gop as it exists is not john kasich, but ted cruz.
in filing its brief supporting the lawsuit, the trump administration conspicuously stopped short of calling on the courts to throw out the entire law, instead seeking invalidation of only those insurance regulations ― like the guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions ― that interact with the mandate.
or maybe it was turnout in the state's college towns of durham, hanover, keene and plymouth? new hampshire allows same-day voter registration, and democrats have long bussed liberal-leaning students to the polls to cast their ballots. (on election day 2016, pretty little liars actor huw collins ― the husband of democratic sen. jeanne shaheen's youngest daughter ― helped drive the busses.) durham, which is home to the university of new hampshire, saw 3,200 same-day registrants alone.
the real threat to biden's coalition could come after jan. 20, should he win. that's when biden and capitol hill leaders would have to start addressing the demands from all the interest groups who supported him.
paul baker, 41, of madison county ran a small lawn service and with his wife owes more than $500,000 for treatment after their truck rolled over. he is grateful to uva for saving my life, he said. but he is frustrated they are ultimately taking my farm when he sells or dies, a result of uva's lawsuit.
if and when the regulation becomes final, as seems likely, attention will shift quickly to state officials, who can regulate insurance plans on their own. states could decide to keep the three-month limit in place, for example. or they could go as far as new jersey did, and prohibit short-term plans altogether.
it's just gotten started, wyden told reporters on wednesday. i can tell you for certain before these hearings are done, democrats will have dug into in great length the issue of turning back the clock on women's privacy.
ronald epps, a 74-year-old retired superintendent who spent six years in columbia's school system, believes that conservatives have thrown their weight behind addressing the country's deficit in ways that only benefit the rich.
it's not that republicans are giving up on the wall ― they're not. they just recognize that a messy spending fight, over a wall, several weeks before an already gloomy midterm election is not the best closing argument for keeping republicans in control of the house and senate.
but that doesn't mean it's impossible, and the health and financial risks of being uninsured make it wise to explore your options.
the university places enrollment holds on student accounts for many reasons, including unpaid tuition and medical bills, said university spokesman wesley hester. this semester the university has active holds on 20 students because of unpaid medical center bills, which might or might not block their attendance depending on when the hold was placed, he said.
and when the pandemic struck, trump ― who downplayed it for two months and called concerns about it a hoax ― blamed obama again. he has complained that obama did not leave him enough medical supplies, and even that obama did not somehow leave him tests for a virus that did not come into being until nearly three years after obama had left office.
progressives have spent the last year turning out, running for office and winning special elections on a positive message. candidates have become causes by embracing an aspirational vision of a government that looks out for all of us.
this dynamic provides a clear opportunity for democratic candidates to shape and win the debate, while also demonstrating the danger of ceding the issue to republicans, global strategy group's pollsters wrote in a memo. committing to enacting these policies and making these issues a focus of their campaigns will be critical for democrats to win over persuadable voters in 2020.
i will be releasing a new list of conservative supreme court justice nominees, which may include some, or many of those already on the list, by september 1, 2020. if given the opportunity, i will only choose from this list, as in the past, a conservative supreme court justice... — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 18, 2020
the biden plan would redefine affordable as 8.5% of income, rather than nearly 10%; extend that guarantee to everybody, not just people with incomes below four times the poverty line; and peg the subsidies to gold plans, which offer coverage pretty similar to what typical employer plans do.
republicans have made it clear from the first week of 2016 what their priorities are and whose side they are on. women across the country are watching, they don't like what they see, and they won't forget.
hawley has said he supports a senate bill that would restore pre-existing condition protections if the courts throw them out. but that bill, like the house bill that bishop and rohrabacher voted to advance, leaves out key provisions necessary to offer the kinds of guarantees that the affordable care act does.
in their book why nations fail , economists daron acemoglu and james a. robinson trace how, in case after tragic case throughout history, extractive elites are the principal reason why great nations decline and fall. specifically (to quote from my review), those nations fail when, through political control, an elite extracts the economic assets ― natural or manufactured ― by means of monopoly, coerced labor, expropriation of land, and exemption from taxation. likewise nobel economist joseph stiglitz warns of the catastrophic price of income inequality.
though experts have warned that the virus is particularly harmful to older people, cases among young people have also skyrocketed amid a downplaying of concern and a lack of wearing masks. in a now-viral video, residents in palm beach county erupted in anger over a new mandatory mask rule.
of course they'll be less expensive, california commissioner dave jones said. that's because it's junk insurance and it won't cover the same things.
among the scholars signing that brief were two conservatives who had helped write or promote previous challenges to the affordable care act. one of them, jonathan adler, a case western law professor, has been even more blunt in interviews and in his own writing, calling the theory of the lawsuit unmoored and absurd.
and vulnerable rep. will hurd (r-texas) claimed, republicans and democrats agree that we should protect pre-existing conditions.
one major thing baldwin has going for her this time is the energy of the resistance on the left. baldwin said the difference between this year and her run in 2012 is night and day in terms of the grassroots help she's getting.
scorn for obamacare has been gop orthodoxy for years, and the party's house and senate leaders are eager to advance its repeal swiftly. but voices ranging from sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.), chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee, to the conservative house freedom caucus are openly questioning the leadership's strategy of formally repealing major elements of the law early this year, but actually keeping them in place for up to four years while the party comes up with the consensus on health care that has previously eluded it.
then came the financial shock: about $50,000 in medical bills.
the results are hilarious images that could entertain any bored student as their teacher rambles on during a lecture.
moore, you see, has made a career of advancing various right-wing political priorities by dressing up as an economist and saying things about money and numbers in print and on tv. unfortunately, almost nothing he says is true.
why the gop's record on health care matters
it is part of why parnell has drawn so much support from left-leaning activists, notwithstanding the two decades he spent as a top executive at the wall street giant goldman sachs. his candidacy offers something of a blueprint for moderate democrats hoping to unite competing factions of the party.
in line with biden's core campaign message — that he wants to restore the soul of the nation — party officials have been emphasizing the chaos of the trump administration, especially during the ongoing health pandemic. the ad includes scenes of hospitals with covid-19 patients, takes note of the disease's rising u.s. death count and replays trump's now-infamous mid-march comments that, no, i don't take responsibility, when asked about the administration's slow response to the pandemic's early stages.
we have learned very clearly that every state is worth contesting and every race is worth investing in, tipirneni told huffpost in an interview. we've learned that repeatedly, so i don't know why we're even addressing it.
this story has been updated with vote counts, additional quotes and news of donald trump's signature.

another part of the democratic plan would provide funding to states to reduce premiums. under this proposal, the federal government would offer $10 billion a year that states could use to give additional subsidies to consumers or establish a reinsurance program to reimburse insurance companies with the costliest customers so that insurers wouldn't pass those costs on to the rest of their policyholders. alaska, minnesota and oregon have already adopted reinsurance programs that have succeeded in reducing premiums.
those figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the federal election commission. but the baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads ― which so-called dark money groups don't necessarily have to report to the fec ― and found there's even more money flowing into the state.
thousands of witnesses, scores of reports
bill clark/cq roll call via getty images senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) and other democrats have been stressing health care as a central issue in the 2018 midterm elections.
industry standards are few and vague. the american hospital association says its members follow internal revenue service guidelines, which merely require hospitals to have a financial assistance policy and to make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient qualifies for help before initiating collections.
harlem united, an hiv-focused community health center serving a largely black community in harlem and the south bronx, has sunk $600,000 into a two-year promotional campaign to drive up local interest in truvada as hiv prevention. posters featuring prep tablets on the stuck-out tongues of grinning new yorkers beckon with the flirty tagline swallow this.
but the executive order was meaningless, as experts pointed out quickly, and that's pretty typical for what he's tried to do. pretty much every piece of legislation he supported during the repeal fight would have dramatically reduced the number of americans with insurance and undermined existing protections for people with preexisting conditions.
he saw the civil rights movement unfold before him and was eventually deployed to vietnam. leakes told huffpost that he identifies as an independent, but his political stances are firmly republican and he voted for trump in 2016.
unlike biden, who has a long record of supporting government action to help people get insurance, president donald trump has spent his presidency trying to take coverage away from millions by repealing or undermining the affordable care act.
the part that he's been playing is now evolving, manafort said, according to the ap. the negatives will come down. the image is going to change.
the justice department's argument is similar to what the attorneys general assert but would only blow up the parts of the law for people with pre-existing conditions, not the rest of it (aha, take that, barack obama ― but please not until after election day).

we are very different, but paul has shown me time and again how much he respects and values women, me most of all. he's the only man i've ever been with who views my time as equally valuable.
in san francisco and new york, which have undertaken concerted efforts to promote prep as a part of elaborate and costly epidemic-ending enterprises, reports from numerous sources show that use of truvada among hiv-negative black msm remains disproportionately low compared with local infection rates among that demographic.
it was this potential to upend the entire law that gave the two 5th circuit judges pause. they said that decisions over whether to throw out the entire law, or to keep parts of it, call for a careful, granular approach and that they were not persuaded that the approach to the severability question set out in the district court opinion satisfies that need.
mcconnell's largesse for kentucky has been pragmatic, what he needed to provide to get into the senate and stay there. his passion is the accumulation of political power. to what ends that power is to be deployed is a question for whatever coalition backs mcconnell ― he is their strategist, not their theologian.
even if lawmakers do, as expected, get behind this vote setting up an obamacare repeal on friday, there are already signs that some republicans may eventually withhold support on a final repeal vote until gop leadership releases details of an alternative.
anna greenberg, a democratic pollster at greenberg quinlan rosner research, cautioned that while there's no doubt that people are concerned about health care costs, she's not sure if that issue ― or any other particular issue ― will be what drives people to the polls in november. in political discussions, people talk more about how much they hate the divisiveness in the country, she said.
mcclellan has a reputation as an accomplished state legislator who has worked in the trenches and is known for bringing together progressive and establishment groups. in the virginia general assembly's most recent session, 36 of her bills became law.
in addition, bates noted, some of aetna's plans were already profitable, including the florida policies that it canceled. in fact, when an company official in charge of aetna's florida plans learned of the decision to shut them down, he responded incredulously. i just can't make sense out of the florida decision, he wrote in an email, adding later, we are making money from the on-exchange business. was florida's performance ever debated?
an example of the latter approach comes from new york city, where mt. sinai's hospital-at-home program dispatches practitioners to the homes of patients for 30 days after discharge. the idea is to help deliver follow-up care while monitoring for post-operative complications. both readmissions and emergency room visits fell by nearly half, according to one study.
what i like about bernie sanders, the little bit i know, is the fact that his ideas which they call socialism, to me i don't think that's what it is, but to me, it's more for the people, said thompson, who identifies as a democrat. people like me, the middle class and the working folks, which i think this country is running on our backs, and it's about to break us.
lyle, who is ceo, can't help wondering whether his falls community hospital will be next.
he similarly said earlier that feinstein's question about whether a sitting president can be required to respond to a subpoena was a hypothetical question.
kentucky, of all places, knows where our future lies, rep. john yarmuth, the state's only congressional democrat, told a who's who of party officials as they picked over a chicken dinner in a ritzy ballroom in downtown louisville in september.
in kansas, for example, an earlier version of the farm bureau bill got stuck in committee, in no small part because of the outcry from groups representing people with cancer and multiple sclerosis. that pressure could stop the newer version of the measure from getting through the legislature ― or, if need be, persuade the newly elected democratic governor to veto the bill. that kind of pressure could also be decisive in states like idaho, where republicans are trying to pass a bill that would scale back a medicaid expansion (in part by adding work requirements) that state voters had approved through a ballot initiative in november.
a big question going forward ― and one that will take analysts some time to parse ― is the extent to which the election results were a verdict on trump as opposed to the conservative ideology he embraced. that has important implications for the next four years, because it will undoubtedly influence how biden governs.
arkansas is only applying the new rules to those living below the poverty line, joan alker, executive director for georgetown's center for children and families, wrote after the arkansas data came out. for these folks, there are scant options for other affordable coverage sources.
but those tax credits vary by annual income, phasing out completely at four times the poverty line, which works out to about $49,000 for an individual and $100,000 for a family of four. and as insurers selling comprehensive policies lose healthier customers to the short-term and association plans, they will have to raise premiums in response. the people who don't qualify for subsidies will have to pay those premiums in full.
it doesn't take a fancypants law degree to see that. but certain legal doctrines matter here and one of them is the concept of standing, which is the idea that a plaintiff must show injury in order to file a lawsuit.
kavanaugh stumbled but eventually said, i'm not thinking of any right now, senator.
longtime trump friend chris ruddy, ceo of the newsmax website, said trump continues his tendency to overstate his accomplishments, probably from his background as a television entertainer. i think it's a theatrical and rhetorical flourish, he said.
you had 4 years to set up the beautiful healthcare system you promised during your 2016 campaign speeches. but no such heathcare has materialised - or even been proposed. — mia farrow (@miafarrow) june 27, 2020
then anything could be subject to reconciliation, a senior democratic aide told the hill in 2017 after conservatives called on the trump administration to execute a similar maneuver. you could authorize war with a simple majority and argue that it affects spending.
the new rules represent one of the most consequential steps that president donald trump and his republican allies have taken in their campaign to dismantle the 2010 health care law known as obamacare. although trump and his partners in congress have not managed to repeal the law outright, they have weakened its underpinnings in ways that have already affected millions and are now set to affect even more people starting in 2019.

both camps may actually benefit from the public's vague understanding of what medicare for all is and what it would do compared to less ambitious approaches like shoring up the affordable care act and adding a public option.

how much influence do the drug manufacturers or insurance companies have over decisions made by pcori and icer? pcori's board of directors is selected by the comptroller general of the united states and is mandated to include at least three patient representatives, along with physicians, researchers, and insurance companies and other payers. icer's governance board has fiduciary responsibility for the overall operations of icer, and provides important strategic counsel to icer's leadership team. the governance board represent a broad range of stakeholder perspectives, including patient and consumer groups, health plans, manufacturers, and other national leaders in health policy. in fact, two new members were recently elected to icer's governance board - ellen andrews, phd and frances visco, jd. both have extensive experience in patient and consumer advocacy.

daniel grossman, md, director of the advancing new standards in reproductive health program at the university of california at san francisco, where he studies the effectiveness of telemedicine in reproductive health care, agrees: i don't think women are going to be dying right and left from the complications of unsafe abortion if roe is overturned. there are workarounds now that were not available back in the 1960s. which means we will see new obstacles to and punishments for those workarounds.

when you can go after party leaders, you're making a straight partisan play to solidify your base. but it doesn't go further than that, holmes said. with donald trump running for reelection, the idea that voters are going to ignore that and then pick and choose based on party leaders, that's absurd to me.
the pandemic has cut us off from some of the critical ways that we can have input, because the committees are not meeting in hearings or markups, raskin said.
when she landed a teaching role at rutgers, ginsburg was paid less than her male peers. when she confronted the dean about it, he said that it was only fair that she receive a lower salary than a man with a family to support, wrote jane sherron de hart in her sweeping biography ruth bader ginsburg: a life.
the 2020 democratic presidential primary is in the middle of a slog, and thursday night's debate reflected that. the campaign is mature enough that multiple candidates have dropped out of the race but still young enough for the top-polling candidates to bring risk-averse approaches to the debate, limiting the possibilities for fireworks. it was late enough in the cycle for most of the arguments to be familiar to a highly informed voter but perhaps not late enough to qualify as must-see television for the less-engaged.
smaller gatherings on march 12 at pocatello's bohemian bru house galilei coffee house in the shadow of a vast mountain range and at a private home in a quiet twin falls neighborhood brought out handfuls of activists making plans for election day.

and as responders like pfeifer look at the country today, they see plenty of people who need help and need lawmakers to step in. they see the mosquito-borne zika virus that causes terrible birth defects. they see the entire city of flint, michigan, poisoned by its own water system — and legislation to help those people going nowhere. they see a senate that won't vote on supreme court nominee merrick garland because one party hopes its side will get to fill the vacant high court seat next year.
trump avoided service in the military. mccain, a navy pilot during the vietnam war, was shot down and held prisoner for more than five years. he was repeatedly tortured, but he declined a north vietnamese offer to release him before others who had been captured earlier. despite fielding criticism from a vast array of public officials, trump refused to apologize and reportedly has no regrets.
the dnc has, however, used its email list to fundraise for tipirneni. it also contributed a five-figure grant to the arizona democratic party for voter outreach and registration through its state party innovation fund, though the grant is not earmarked for use in the special election for arizona's 8th district.
the new health care reforms aren't supposed to be a substitute for medicare for all or some of the other ambitious health plans that have captivated and energized progressives around the country. newsom has previously endorsed the creation of such a single, government-run insurance program and the new budget agreement establishes a commission to figure out how such a proposal would work in california.
in a 2009 interview, while moore was a senior fellow at the cato institute, a libertarian think tank funded by the fossil-fuel billionaire koch brothers, he dismissed an obama administration climate report as stalinistic and said climate change is really climate improvement.
sleazy guy is sleazy - paul blumenthal: the journal reports that [chicago financier peter w.] smith, who died last month at the age of 81, repeatedly stated he was working with michael flynn, then an adviser to donald trump's presidential campaign and later the shortest-serving national security adviser in u.s. history…. beginning in 1992, smith funded various research projects to publicize negative stories about president bill clinton. he paid arkansas state troopers, allegedly to help with their finances in case they were retaliated against, and helped publicize the troopers' claims that clinton forced troopers to arrange his trysts with women and hide those relationships from his wife. smith introduced these troopers to david brock, then a conservative reporter with the american spectator, who penned an article based on their statements. brock later became an ardent clinton defender and apologized for the article, claiming that the payments smith made to the troopers tainted their version of events. smith also paid brock $5,000 for another research project that never came to fruition.

sen. roger wicker (r-miss.), meanwhile, said that his party needs to address the issue of obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which the lawsuit is seeking to invalidate. if that legal challenge succeeds in the courts, it would also do away with other popular provisions of the law like the one allowing parents to keep their children on their health insurance plan until the kids turn 26 years old.
for a day or two, fluke thought the entire controversy would be a footnote in the obamacare fights -- another hearing gathering dust in the c-span archives. but then rush limbaugh targeted her: he went on his radio show, butchered her name, and called her a slut. the rest, as they say, is history.
as the governor's race began to heat up in 2019, the teachers helped set the agenda in the democratic primary, focusing the race on public education in particular. beshear, who had chosen high school assistant principal jacqueline coleman — an original ky 120 united member — as his running mate, won the primary in may, and turned his attention toward the fall election against his archrival.
grassley's tuesday town hall was the latest in a series of events this month at which constituents across the country have angrily confronted their representatives over the gop's vow to repeal the affordable care act soon. republicans have yet to offer an alternative health care plan.
that's an alternative to the affordable care act ― not a replacement.
just this week, for example, several conservative republicans in congress said they would vote against any bill with refundable credits, because they would consider giving money to people with no income tax liability akin to creating a new entitlement. of course, a bill with no refundable credits would, by definition, leave out a huge chunk of the population now getting coverage through obamacare.
the other leading candidates are in the middle, and that includes harris. on monday, she proposed creating a new government insurance program that would become the default option for everybody while still allowing private insurers to offer an alternative. harris also envisions a 10-year transition to the new system, rather than the four-year transition sanders has in his proposal.

senate minority leader chuck schumer and house speaker-to-be nancy pelosi made their first visit to the white house since their dec. 11 meeting with trump, when he said he would be proud to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. on wednesday, the democratic leaders emerged from the white house after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to trump.

the affordable care act turns 9 years old saturday, and, in some respects, the program has never been more secure.
the result is that a significant number of people buying coverage on the marketplaces are still struggling with health care expenses.
the new bill, like its predecessors, does not offer many details on these financial provisions, making it impossible to say with precision how different groups of americans would ultimately fare, or whether it would require new deficit spending. but sanders on wednesday is distributing a separate list of funding options, including new payroll taxes, and vowing to fight health care industry groups that, he said, were profiting at the expense of the american public.
similar risks exist for people who opt for other alternatives, like christian health sharing ministries and the farm bureau plans sold in iowa and tennessee.
we've worked hard to raise money, but it's just based on the energy and enthusiasm for these candidates. rep. seth moulton (d-mass.)
trump was impeached wednesday for using $391 million in taxpayer money to get an illegal advantage in his reelection ― 45 years after richard nixon faced impeachment for using tens of thousands of dollars of campaign money to do the same thing.
democrats are already hoping montanans will split ballots in november for bullock. williams could get the benefit as well if there's truly a big democratic groundswell.
cbs' jan crawford first reported roberts' change in 2012, shortly after the decision was handed down. the latest excerpt adds more detail to his reasoning and details the thinking of two liberal justices.
callaway understands why people go to the ministries anyway. it's because the plans from healthcare.gov and insurers have gotten so expensive. and if they don't turn to ministries, they will turn to some other alternative.
the host targeted senate republican negotiations to hammer out a healthcare bill that is expected to deprive millions of medical coverage. he noted that the talks are behind closed doors.
the last time an issue related to the affordable care act landed in o'connor's courtroom was in 2016, when he blocked obama administration regulations that would have prohibited health care providers from refusing to treat transgender patients for religious reasons. that ruling probably had more to do with his feelings about religious freedom and lgbtq rights than the affordable care act, but nobody walked away thinking he was a fan of the law, the people who wrote it or the ideas behind it.
but for the moment, the majority of the benefits from the supreme court battle have accumulated to democrats.

taxes on wealthy people would fall, and the law's controversial individual mandate ― a penalty for people who don't get coverage ― would go away immediately, although most parts of the law with direct bearing on insurance coverage would not take effect until 2020.
for a radical overhaul, for a true disruption, there's really only one possible actor: the federal government.
that hasn't stopped the gop-led congress and republican presidential candidates from clamoring for repeal -- or from making vague pronouncements about replacing obamacare with something or other, even though it's not possible to achieve the affordable care act goal of expanding coverage using the policies typically espoused by republicans.
madam speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states, and my fellow americans:
in theory, there would be what are known as high-risk pools to help cover people whose pre-existing conditions create a barrier. trouble is, high-risk pools historically have been underfunded. the original republican plan had around $100 billion in federal funds devoted to the pools, and an amendment designed to get more votes last week added another $8 billion over five years.
the senator has had several plans so far, and any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years, biden said. this is the single most important issue facing the public, and, to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat president trump with double-talk on this plan.
as a result, many middle-income families found the only coverage available was expensive ― in some cases, prohibitively expensive ― and even then came with high deductibles. making matters worse, obama had promised that people could keep their plans if they liked them.
it also bears repeating that this joint venture will serve only the three companies' own employees. while the new company may have lessons for other employers, it will not provide the sort of wholesale disruption of the american health care system that so many have breathlessly predicted. more likely, it will merely be yet another tinkering at the margins, yielding small ripples of innovation rather than a tidal wave of change.

we did get a health care reform bill through that did protect people with pre-existing conditions, rep. warren davidson (r-ohio) said.
hays: i've seen good leaders and bad during my air force and business careers, but the best had three primary characteristics: integrity, competency, and energy. republican house majority leader amy stephens has all three in abundance....
the debate between medicare for all skeptics like biden and its advocates, especially sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), was part of a broader dispute that pitted progressives against moderates, and upstarts versus the establishment, in the 2020 democratic primaries. it is likely to be a source of even more friction in the future ― especially if biden wins and the democrats win control of both chambers of congress, offering the first real chance in a decade to pass meaningful progressive laws.
that's a great model in a father, she said.
but biden said something else in thursday's debate: not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan.
no one is going to want to work at a place where employees are forced to work through illness ― and people aren't going to want to shop at stores, or eat in restaurants, where workers are coming in sick, either. there's a basic confidence issue here, she said.
nothing has exemplified bevin's potential problems more than his ongoing feud with public school teachers across kentucky, a yearlong saga that has highlighted and exacerbated his biggest vulnerabilities.
that has created demand for cheaper alternatives, especially for people who don't get much or any financial assistance. christian health ministry plans are filling that demand.
this comes at a time when democratic leaders in blue states are pushing progressive agendas that go far beyond what the divided federal government is capable of these days.
mcgrath, who will face incumbent republican rep. andy barr in november, trailed gray by as much as 40 points when he entered the race in december, according to her internal polling, but steadily gained ground in the ensuing months with a campaign that sought to paint her as an outsider running against gray and the national democratic establishment.
her speech to families usa highlighted her own rhetorical style and policy emphases. she began with a deeply personal anecdote ― the kind sanders tends to eschew ― about how, when she was a child, her family was permanently set back financially because of expenses related to her father's heart attack.
we've seen this happen in other areas. we've seen this happen with marriage equality. we've seen this happen with lots of things that have changed over time, which is that the politics won't change on their own. in fact, you could make the case that they'll get worse on their own. but what i think is quite possible over the next medium term, not near term, is that we have a fundamental shift over how politicians are forced to think about these issues because the public is pretty firmly in this camp.
in massachusetts, two primaries have caught national attention: one is the heated senate race between incumbent ed markey, who is being challenged by rep. joe kennedy. the second is neal's primary — a threat to the chair of the most powerful house committee, ways and means.
you've been trying to strike down pre-existing conditions.
and oh, yeah, something like 20 million people would lose health insurance.
for now, though, the main political divide on health care is between those who want government to do more to help people get health care and those who want government to do less.
the logic here is that co-pays and deductibles inevitably fall hardest on the sick, because they have higher medical bills, and the poor, because they have less money at their disposal. research shows that these groups will frequently respond to high out-of-pocket costs by rationing their own treatments and, as a result, suffer.
twitter's policy against hateful conduct prohibits behavior that incites fear about a protected group and repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone. one digital sleuth who tracks @amymek told huffpost that he has reported the account to twitter more than 50 times to no avail. although the company has withheld mekelburg's account in germany and france, twitter has done little to cramp her style in the u.s.
the inability of large players in the insurance industry to make a profit on the health insurance exchanges has raised questions about whether the affordable care act's individual mandate creates a strong enough incentive for healthy people to enroll and whether the price of exchange coverage is too high, especially for those whose incomes are too high to qualify for financial assistance or who are eligible for only small subsidies.
by the same token, a presidency that made medicare for all an immediate priority would likely have less time and attention for other issues, like climate change or child care, because presidential attention is a limited resource and something as big and controversial as medicare for all would not leave room for pushing much else.
while the trump administration broadens its monstrous ambitions from destroying protections for pre-existing conditions to tearing down every last benefit and protection the affordable care act provides, democrats are putting forward new legislation to lower health insurance premiums and strengthen protections for america's families, pelosi said in a statement tuesday.
the policy could allow many people to fall through the cracks, including those with chronic health conditions, and those with mental health or substance use disorders such as opioid addiction, hannah katch, a senior analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities, told huffpost. and for those who are eligible for an exemption, the policy could still require someone who is medically frail, for example, to jump through administrative hoops to demonstrate that they are eligible for an exemption.
and it's not just a question of understanding the limits on what short-term plans cover. it's also a question of matching up those limits to the likely costs of an intensive medical episode ― something that even experts can find difficult.
sanders' goal has always been revolution. he starts with a bold but typically simple premise ― every american should have health care ― which leads to a policy solution — in this case, medicare for all. he then works to rally people to his cause.
the last word on any decision to strike down the health care law almost certainly will come from the supreme court, which has twice sustained the 2010 health law. chief justice john roberts and four more liberal justices who voted in favor of the law remain on the court. a court victory would fulfill trump's goal of undoing the law, but it could be politically costly for the gop by ending popular provisions such as protection for pre-existing conditions and coverage for young adults on their parents' health plans.
there was also the broad-shouldered gentleman in a tank top who displayed his stars-and-bars-themed iron cross tattoo on his arm, as well as the unsubtle duo standing next to him, whose own outfits showed off the slogans, don't ever think that the reason i am peaceful is because i forgot how to be violent and if you don't bleed red, white & blue, take your bitch ass home.
republicans could not repeal the affordable care act last year, and they seem unlikely to try again anytime soon. but they are finding places where, through a combination of new state laws and new federal regulations, they can transform obamacare's health insurance markets into something more to their liking ― namely, markets full of cheaper, less generous plans available to people in good health.
despite this, trump claimed in his august speech at the republican national convention that we will always and very strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions.
women refused to accept his actions without pushback, launching the twitter handle @periodsforpence. it received renewed traction during the republican convention.
(reuters) - a federal judge on wednesday ruled against u.s. health insurer anthem inc's proposed $54 billion merger with smaller rival cigna corp, derailing an unprecedented effort to consolidate the country's health insurance industry.
the case, now called california v. texas, comes from republican state officials and has the backing of president donald trump. it alleges that the 2010 health care law known as obamacare contains a fatal constitutional flaw, requiring the justices to wipe it off the books.
in other words, people without insurance are struggling to pay for their medications, but so are some people who have insurance.
watch the bernie sanders' advertisement two visions, mentioned by clinton's campaign, here:
at the howard speech, the president's presentation of the american narrative included more of a focus on how life for african americans has improved over time. he cited the importance of the changes to law that the civil rights movement won, and continued: those mileposts of our progress were not perfect. they did not make up for centuries of slavery or jim crow or eliminate racism or provide for 40 acres and a mule. but they made things better. obama added:
chris peterson, 62, told the senator that he has diabetes and that he would not be able to afford health insurance if not for the affordable care act.
trump in 2018 also dismantled the pandemic response team obama created three years earlier following an ebola outbreak in africa. that had been led at the national security council level within the white house, and eliminating that structure hurt the administration's ability to respond to the new virus quickly, wrote beth cameron, who ran the office.
here tonight is debra bissell. just three weeks ago, debra's parents, gerald and sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their reno, nevada, home by an illegal alien. they were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. also here tonight are gerald and sharon's granddaughter, heather, and great‑granddaughter, madison.
we should ask why we still don't have an ongoing, evidence-based mechanism to evaluate the comparative clinical and cost effectiveness of health services. the answer is that it has been opposed successfully to date by the economic and political power of the vested interests that profit from the status quo of our deregulated marketplace. the citizens united decision has enabled the infusion of even more money into politics, in both major parties, and massive lobbyist campaigns are launched by corporate stakeholders defending their interests whenever new legislation for cea is being contemplated. meanwhile, the insurance industry blames the drug industry for accelerating costs even as it increases its own costs and profits at the expense of its enrollees and taxpayers.
no vote tonight, a gop leadership aide said.
it's not a bill. it isn't scored, pelosi said in a wednesday roundtable with reporters. we're trying to figure out how many people would lose insurance.
finally, newsom called for legislation that would open up medi-cal, the state's version of the medicaid program, to undocumented young adults. california already offers medi-cal to undocumented immigrants until they turn 19. this would push the eligibility age up to 26.
trump still has no answers on health care
asked about the basic tenets of his health care bill, graham declined to provide any real details until republicans had either passed or dispensed with their current legislation. (graham said he thought the bill coming to the floor next week would fail.)
this is not how developed countries typically operate. even in countries like the netherlands, which provide universal coverage through private insurance, government limits what hospitals make by establishing fees, overall budgets, or some combination of the two. here in the u.s., more than half the states used to regulate hospital prices in one way or another and, in the 1970s, then-president jimmy carter pushed hard for legislation to regulate hospital charges nationally. it was supposed to be the first step toward creating a national health system.
i don't know how many times he's shot the bear, but i've seen it in every ad. stop talking about the bear already! he said. what alaskan hasn't run into a bear?
the law republicans are trying to replace extended health coverage to 20 million previously uninsured people and reduced the national uninsured rate to the lowest ever recorded. a 2015 congressional budget office analysis also projected it would reduce the federal budget deficit by as much as $137 billion ― to $353 billion ― by 2025.
one certainty emerges: trump's gop is bent on burying the subject of trump's ongoing indebtedness to russia. transparently, republican officeholders fear only trump's base, its donors ― and the truth. if they can conjure tax cuts and right-wing judges, they no longer care by what means, or whose agency, this happened. when it comes to keeping power, the party of fake principles is willing to partner with trump and putin in corrupting american democracy.
it requires, instead, some combination of government regulation and government spending ― whether it's the complex subsidies and rules of the affordable care act or something that looks more like medicare for all, the proposal to displace private insurance with a new, government-run insurance plan.
this so-called coverage gap exists because the affordable care act was supposed to implement a medicaid expansion nationwide, making private insurance subsidies unnecessary for this population. but a 2012 supreme court ruling that allowed states to refuse the expansion left the poorest adults with no affordable coverage options.
president donald trump on monday said he would wait until after the 2020 elections for a congressional vote on a republican plan to replace obamacare. there is no evidence that any such plan currently exists.
of course, obama recognizes that we've still got work to do on the matter of racial injustice and inequality:
if you tuned into cable news over the past few days, you may have seen a clip of freshman rep. katie porter (d-calif.) tearing into jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon over the wages he pays to low-level employees.
those most likely to become uninsured are people with low-to-moderate incomes who qualify for medicaid or subsidized private insurance under the 2010 health care law.
republicans won control of the house in the november 2010 midterm elections and, almost immediately, launched their campaign to repeal the affordable care act. and although they failed, just barely, to pass repeal legislation, they managed to undermine the program in myriad ways, big and small.
despite numerous requests over several weeks, the white house has not provided any economic analysis to back up trump's claims. outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the north american free trade agreement, which trump has rebranded the united states mexico canada agreement, will not bring in to the u.s. treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. more important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the u.s., not mexico.
suddenly, trump likes the idea of mitt romney ― a man who called him a fraud, among many other things, and who recently said trump is not a role model for his grandchildren ― in the senate. and trump, who has pilloried senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) on twitter and was leading an insurgent campaign to oust gop senators who he believed were not supporting him fervently enough, has backed every incumbent senator this fall, helping to keep out extreme candidates he previously heralded but who might be easier for democrats to beat.
donald trump has lost the presidency, as the television networks and decision desks have now declared. it will take time to sort through the results and talk to voters, in order to figure out exactly why they decided to oust him after one term. but trump's job performance surely had some impact.
warren spoke at the annual gathering of the consumer advocacy group families usa. she emphasized that she wholeheartedly supports efforts to expand public health insurance programs, including a single-payer bill introduced by sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) that would expand medicare to the entire population.
congress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions. ... it repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place, reads a brief to the court written by an ideologically diverse group of legal scholars.
but ocasio-cortez is also realistic about how far even a president sanders could actually move congress.
washington ― with the coronavirus spreading across the globe, u.s. politicians seem to be rethinking some of their most dearly held beliefs about socialized medicine.
dr. laura meyers, president & ceo of planned parenthood of metropolitan washington, told the huffington post that it's crucial for americans to hear these progressive voices of faith speak up for women.
ocasio-cortez stressed that just getting a public option for health care wasn't the left's ultimate goal. but she also said she wasn't here to railroad other members with differing viewpoints on health care ― she just thinks it helps to have a president who has a more ambitious platform than congress so that democrats could stretch what's possible.
however, the lack of stability created by the false urgency to present and vote on rushed, shoddily-written legislation will certainly throw certain states into one and disproportionately harm states that trump won in last november's election.
much of what republicans don't want americans to know is obvious. whether trump conspired with russia to influence the 2016 election in his favor. whether trump did this in exchange for a promise of sanctions relief, financial assistance ― or both. whether trump obstructed justice to avoid discovery. whether trump is a modern-day manchurian candidate disloyal to his oath of office.
since then, smith said, grayson has had a national profile, and has had both large and small donors from well outside his orlando district contributing to his efforts.
trump is now insisting that congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while democrats want a short-term spending bill for the department of homeland security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.
she did say she thought a sanders presidency would help significantly with the potentially poor politics of medicare for all. if we're electing bernie sanders, we can get there, jayapal said.
sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., opened the final day of her testimony praising president donald trump's nominee as an unashamedly pro-life conservative who is making history as a role model for other women.
he has no plan. he has no vision. he's not talking about health care, galloway said of parson in a phone interview. he's not trying to address this with any policy proposal. the contrast could not be more stark.
one of the strangest side-effects of my tinder experience was the visibility it provides: people approached me at starbucks and whole foods saying, i just saw you on tinder! (the app has a gps feature, caveat emptor.)
goldstein says he wants to build an enormous progressive caucus by finding democrats who sit outside the norms of the democratic party and replacing them with progressives. and, he says, something else has caught voters' attention.
recollections of biden's contributions to the legislative effort are clearer, in part, because he had developed a reputation within the white house for his acumen as a dealmaker. several former officials noted that biden had played a pivotal role in convincing sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania to switch parties, without which democrats would not have had the 60 votes they needed to overcome a filibuster and pass legislation.
trump slammed the press — again ― as fake news, vowed to topple obamacare and promised to build the border wall between mexico and the u.s. don't worry, we're going to have the wall, trump said at the rally marking his 100th day as president. rest assured. go home, go to sleep.
all elected leaders have to make difficult strategic decisions and face political reality. on health care specifically, it's entirely possible that medicare for all is beyond the reach of even the most motivated president and energized grassroots right now ― because the entire health care industry would fight it, because people with employer insurance would be reluctant to give it up and because getting massive reforms through congress is difficult under any circumstances. some versions of the public option might be easier to pass and still have far-reaching effects.
but mcconnell has absorbed the most important political lesson from the gop's house effort ― namely, that the american health care act is wildly unpopular. the more the public knows about it, the less it seems to like it.
trump claimed, as always, that he is the one who passed the veterans choice law. barack obama signed that into law in 2014. trump signed a 2018 law to modify it.
the plans are less expensive because they cover fewer services, and, unlike under obamacare, people who have serious, expensive-to-treat medical problems can't get them. moreover, experts say they would undermine obamacare's health exchange markets by allowing healthier customers to flock to the skimpier plans, resulting in higher premiums for those who want or need more comprehensive coverage.
harris on monday released a plan to create a new, government-run insurance plan designed to cover all americans and pay for nearly all their medical expenses.
mccain voted against his party's bill to repeal and replace obamacare last summer.
there are so many people, especially people in my situation — a life event happened and then you turn around and you're uninsured at a time when you need to be insured, and there is no insurance, she said. it's like a no-brainer that insurance should be granted to everyone.
supporters would argue that the track record of such systems abroad suggests that the government can allocate resources as well, if not better than, the private market. a well-funded single-payer system could even mean better care, more choices of provider or shorter waits for appointments. it all depends on the details.
as sanders and his aides pointed out, the benefits package under his plan would be considerably more generous than what exists under traditional medicare. currently, high out-of-pocket expenses cause most seniors to sign up for some kind of supplemental or alternative coverage, whether it's private medi-gap or medicare advantage plans or, if they qualify, medicaid.
health care reform is personal to him. he said without obamacare, his daughter would not have received the medical attention she needed.
eventually, insurers that take in too many sick and too few healthy people are driven out of business.
lauren underwood (d-ill.), who also defeated an incumbent republican in 2018, said she would talk about the budget as a way to underscore why the work democrats do is important. this is life and death for the american people, underwood said, adding that health care is still the no. 1 issue in 2020 elections.
i'm just amazed at how quickly we forget, prager told huffpost. there were a lot of people out there left out of the markets because they had pre-existing conditions; they couldn't get comprehensive coverage for what they needed, and the only way to really solve the problem is to make the same rules apply to everybody.
8. abelson, r, pollack, a. medicare widens drugs it accepts for cancer care: more off-label uses. new york times, january 27, 2009.
now is the time for bipartisan action. believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.
these kinds of coverage details would likely be open to negotiation if serious deliberations over legislative language ever got underway. one reason some medicare for all proponents don't openly contemplate compromise is that they want to push the boundaries of debate as far as they can, in the hopes of energizing supporters while avoiding preemptive, potentially unnecessary concessions. they understand that final legislation will look different and that it might even end up looking like medicare for america.
fortunately for patients, there are two places where their voices will be heard and where they can find good, evidence-based information. one is a non-governmental nonprofit program called pcori (patient-centered outcomes research institute); the other is a nonprofit called icer (institute for clinical and economic review). pcori was funded in 2010 by the federal government as part of the affordable care act (one of the many aspects of obamacare most don't know about). the institute's money comes from the government and fees assessed to private insurance and self-insured employer-based plans, but pcori is completely independent and conducts its business in public. pcori's mission is to help people make informed healthcare decisions, and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes, by producing and promoting high-integrity, evidence-based information that comes from research guided by patients, caregivers, and the broader healthcare community. pcori meetings are public and patients are heavily involved in deciding what research should be done and by whom. pcori's research has included how to best manage side effects of cancer treatment, how to help people recover from strokes more rapidly, and how to pull specialists together to more effectively treat lung cancer. these research projects were all selected and guided by patient input.
the numbers are keeping peters' campaign on its toes going into the final stretch of the election season. in 2016, hillary clinton fell short in democratic strongholds like detroit and flint, particularly among black voters — a dip in turnout that helped donald trump narrowly win the state by less than 11,000 votes.
kennedy's profile has been rising since trump's election, particularly in his defense of immigrant and lgbtq rights, as well as the affordable care act.
we offer a generous compensation package of $174,000 per year, with some benefits. (you will have to purchase your health care on the obamacare exchanges.)
there are the millions who get subsidized private insurance through the exchanges, the millions on expanded medicaid and then all the millions with preexisting conditions who have guarantees of coverage they would not have without the law.
but preserving those protections is not a priority for most republicans, at either the state or the federal level. they would prefer to reduce health insurance premiums by letting insurers cover fewer services and exclude people with serious medical problems. and they are trying their best to realize that vision ― by, for example, encouraging enrollment in short-duration insurance plans that aren't subject to the affordable care act's requirements.
in 1996, though, with media billionaire rupert murdoch's backing, the by-then-veteran gop political operative founded fox news, essentially creating a republican-oriented channel in the still new world of cable television. it won market share by offering viewers an openly pro-gop perspective, while other networks and newspapers divided up the remaining news audience committed to traditional journalism.
making decisions about health insurance is complicated and potentially very costly. it's no surprise that americans don't do a great job of it. it takes work to figure out the best health insurance options. and few people take the time to do it right.
the vast majority of people will not take cobra due to the cost, pollitz said.
in short, the republican party no longer belongs to you, or you in it. 2016 has proven the point.
it stands a good chance of being taken up by the supreme court next year, smack dab in the middle of the 2020 presidential election, creating another headache for the gop.
democrats are rejoicing. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) delayed this past week's planned vote on the republican effort to repeal obamacare. but liberals should hold the champagne. mcconnell will be back. his entire political career — the meaning of 40 years of professional energy — depends on it.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and his allies talk a lot about how medicare for all would take back money from insurers and drug companies, and use those savings to help make sure every american has generous health insurance. that is accurate.
the 5th circuit judges appeared to acknowledge this fact, noting that the opinion gives relatively little attention to the intent of the 2017 congress. but it did not provide more direct guidance on which parts of the law o'connor should spare.
hospital systems across the houston area warned officials earlier this week that they were nearing icu bed capacity — considered to be a key metric in how well an area is handling the coronavirus outbreak.
because these people get no assistance, they pay full premiums. that has been particularly tough on some older californians, because by law insurers can still charge them up to three times as much as they charge younger people, leaving them with a choice of scraping up money for insurance they can't really afford or taking their chances with no coverage at all.
#yomemo is so dumb it makes eric trump look smart — donaldtrumpnewstoday (@irishrygirl) february 3, 2018
one reason is that hospitals were part of negotiations that produced the 2010 health care law and ultimately endorsed its payment changes, figuring that a system with fewer uninsured americans would also be a system with more paying customers. medicare for all or a variant like medicare for america (which includes automatic enrollment of the uninsured) would offer hospitals the same upside.
in their appeal, becerra and his coalition argued that zeroing out the penalty does not make the individual mandate unconstitutional — noting that the framework for the tax remains in place.
people who bought the short-term plans would frequently save money, as long as they didn't get sick and find themselves on the hook for bills the short-term plans don't cover. but premiums for those comprehensive policies could get even higher than they are now.
this ends up creating a cycle, as the group of people still buying traditional policies gets less and less healthy. that will make the market less attractive to insurance companies, driving up prices and reducing plan choices for consumers that want or need real insurance coverage, said sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university.
in georgia, the state's leading republicans — including gov. brian kemp and two senators up for reelection — all gathered to bask in trump's praise. the defeat of either sen. david perdue or sen. kelly loeffler would be a huge blow to the gop's prospects for keeping the majority in the senate.
but over time, the plans could draw even more people, especially if insurers and the independent brokers who sell plans push them aggressively. and some experts think that rough estimate, of just 100,000 to 200,000 people shifting plans initially, is too low.
there is no evidence in her three years on the bench that barrett is anything but supportive of typically anti-feminist causes, including gun rights, limits on reproductive freedom and hostility toward the affordable care act, which has brought health insurance to many many millions of women who are mothers.
i believe sen. mcconnell will follow through, independent sen. angus king of maine, who caucuses with the democrats, told reporters monday. i think he's made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally, particularly this morning ― which was a stronger statement than last night ― it'd be very difficult for him to try to find a way out of meeting that commitment.
but the gop's hopes of passing some bill ― any bill ― were alive and well tuesday night, with a scaled-down version of repeal looking increasingly in good shape after leadership revealed their plan earlier in the day of passing a skinny repeal if lawmakers agreed to open debate.
and while veterans want veterans choice, there is confusion around the program. over 84 percent of veterans state they are not currently participating in the veteran's choice program, yet one-third (33.1 percent) report having a veterans choice card. furthermore, of the 15.9 percent of veterans currently participating, only 58.1 percent state they have used their veterans choice card.
bill akins, the secretary of the republican party of pasco county, made the claim during the town hall on saturday.
the situation is more complicated for adults, especially those who do not have disabilities or minor children living at home.
hospital groups and physicians have warned that passing a repeal bill without a replacement could be massively disruptive, even if the repeal is delayed.
meanwhile, those who already have pre-existing conditions generally won't have access to these policies. higher premiums will disproportionately hit middle-income americans who already have health problems, according to the urban researchers.
if the dangers of government spending or socialized medicine keep mcconnell up at night, his record in congress doesn't show it. the man currently trying to ram through a bill that would make health insurance unaffordable for 22 million more americans used to shower his home state with federal funding for health care projects as a matter of routine.
in theory, the new requirements would not affect children, the elderly, pregnant women, primary caregivers or the medically frail, because kentucky's proposal explicitly exempts them. but those categories are narrower than they might seem, experts warned friday as they pored over the final proposal and checked it against previous versions. (every analyst studying it has warned that their conclusions are still a little tentative.)
in recent weeks, trump has turned gop gubernatorial races into his own personal playground, endangering eight years of republican dominance over the nation's governor's mansions. it culminated tuesday night when kansas gov. jeff colyer conceded to trump-endorsed secretary of state kris kobach and businessman jeff johnson defeated former gov. tim pawlenty in minnesota's primary after hammering him over his criticisms of trump in 2016.
after priming viewers to imagine a paul bunyan-like pioneer ― he shot a grizzly bear dead in self defense! ― the ad introduces dr. al gross, a bespectacled orthopedic surgeon trying to unseat sen. dan sullivan, a first-term republican up for reelection in november. gross, who is also a commercial fisherman and health care activist, is running for senate as an independent, but plans to caucus with democrats.
among the democratic candidates, warren, and sens. cory booker (n.j.), kirsten gillibrand (n.y.) and kamala harris (calif.) are co-sponsors of sanders' bill and reps. tulsi gabbard (hawaii), tim ryan (ohio) and eric swalwell (calif.) are co-sponsors of a similar house bill introduced by rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.).
the center's plan is still just a vague framework, which means it leaves lots of unanswered questions ― starting with the exact financing mechanism. and to conservatives, of course, it would be exactly the wrong way to approach health care ― increasing spending, regulation and taxes, rather than decreasing all three.
don't expect donnelly, arguably the most vulnerable democratic senator running for re-election in 2018, to return the favor.
yemen has officially reported more than 1,000 cases of covid-19 and 275 deaths, but the actual number is expected to be much higher.
this isn't just unique to nevada, hanauer said. this is a republican party federal problem. their voters voted to shake up washington, not blow up government as we know it, certainly not blow up the key things voters care about.
msnbc host rachel maddow confronted democratic presidential candidate hilary clinton on her program thursday, asking about her campaign's recent attacks against vermont sen. bernie sanders, who happens to be rising in the polls in early voting states iowa and new hampshire.
a: former vice president joe biden and former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg have different plans, but they take a similar approach.
with no health insurance as the pandemic stretches into its second year, barradez is uneasy. we are not exempt from having something happen to us, she said in spanish, her first language. not having the means to respond is extremely worrisome.
earlier this month, rep. tom mcclintock (r-calif.) left a town hall with a police escort after constituents confronted him. rep. jason chaffetz (r-utah) also faced chants of do your job and your last term at a town hall last week. rep. dave brat (r-va.) complained that women are in my grill over obamacare repeal. brat has since walked back the comment, which offended many.
the overall effect of the law, however, has been to improve access to care, financial security and overall health, according to a large body of evidence. if it comes off the books, 20 million people would likely lose coverage, according to estimates from the urban institute, a left-leaning think tank based in washington. that would represent a 65% increase in the number of americans without coverage.
booker noted concerns about the pandemic-driven voting setup as he conceded defeat late tuesday afternoon.
constituents of rep. tom reed (r-n.y.) flooded two town hall meetings on saturday to confront and boo the congressman over the gop's vows to repeal the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, and strip public funding from planned parenthood.
whether these and other briefs sway the judge, a conservative and republican appointee, is an open question. but democratic officials from california and other states have stepped in to defend the law, and if they lose before the district judge, they will almost certainly appeal to the circuit court — and then, if need be, all the way up to the supreme court.
trump has already campaigned once for braun, coming to the state just days after his primary victory. republicans hope the president makes repeated visits. donnelly has largely avoided criticizing the president, instead aiming his attacks at senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. it's a way for donnelly to avoid alienating trump voters in a state the president won by 19 percentage points in 2016. (donnelly is one of 10 senate democrats running for re-election in a state trump won.)
darrell goodwin, 50, local business owner
those state decisions not to expand have deprived rural hospitals, which already operate with the slimmest of margins, of resources that could be the difference between survival and closure.
but kaiser also tested some of the arguments that republicans and other opponents of medicare for all have made against such schemes ― and already are making now. when respondents heard that medicare for all would eliminate private insurance, for example, support dropped dramatically, with just 37 percent favoring it and 58 percent opposing.
don't let the ahca get swamped by comey — stay vigilant and keep applying pressure on the senate to #protectourcare. https://t.co/7kthfyq5jg — jason sparks (@sparksjls) june 8, 2017
ruy teixeira, a demographer and public opinion expert at the democratic party-aligned center for american progress who doubts the political wisdom of warren's decision to embrace the elimination of most private health insurance, recommended that she bring it back to the big picture.
there are some of our freedom caucus guys who are willing to say, 'let's give them a chance to bring something conservative in a replacement,' meadows said. there are some who say, 'we know what's coming.'
but wednesday's spectacle, especially the testy exchanges between biden and harris, quite possibly left them more confused than before.
as he might have expected at a labor forum, sen. cory booker (n.j.) found himself defending his record as a promoter of charter schools in his time as the mayor of newark, n.j. charter schools are falling out of fashion in the democratic party after last year's historic teacher strikes. booker's boosterism for them has put him at odds with teachers unions that contend such schools siphon money away from already underfunded public education. he noted that the largest teachers unions in new jersey supported his senate candidacy.
where is all the money going? who profits the most from this system?
kavanaugh, for his part, kept coming back to the broader principle that courts should start with a presumption of severability ― i.e., that the rest of a law can survive when one part is found to be unconstitutional. he raised it three separate times, the last in a question to acting u.s. solicitor general jeffrey wall, who was arguing on behalf of the trump administration.

maher also likened the way that president donald trump appears to be dealing with climate change to someone putting black tape over the check engine light when their car was breaking down.
but on capitol hill, republicans seem eager to deemphasize obamacare, which polls show becoming more popular, and focus instead on medicare for all, which has the potential to rattle voters who fear change.
i know how hard it was to get passed, he added. starting over just makes no sense to me.
every post-election meeting i have attended has been crowded and humid, thomas henderson, the party's county chair, said.
meanwhile, progressives have gone out of their way to stay aligned with pelosi. after the select committee on the climate crisis didn't get the subpoena power progressives wanted, most liberals stayed quiet about it. when ocasio-cortez was asked why she didn't join the committee on thursday after pelosi invited her to be on it, the new york lawmaker said it was because she was busy with her other committees ― and she didn't mention the lack of subpoena power.
stockholm, wis. ― on a cold, icy day in february, a couple dozen people were tucked into the stockholm pie and general store, the heart of this tiny village along the mississippi river. the gathering was actually sizable, considering the population of stockholm is just 66.
steve bannon backed grimm last fall, showcasing him as part of his insurgency against the establishment ― just as he backed roy moore's failed senate bid in alabama ― but now even bannon sees the stakes are too high.
i knew the republicans would do everything in their power to try and repeal obamacare, biden said in an email to supporters monday. but i'm surprised that so many democrats are running on getting rid of it.
white house press secretary sean spicer has downplayed aarp's opposition to the health care bill, calling the organization a special interest.
but fitzpatrick didn't think that it would weigh him down too much, because he can answer for himself. he did think, however, that the proposal is still an election issue, particularly for nonprofit organizations in districts that could be affected by the blueprint.
win mcnamee/pool via associated press supreme court chief justice john roberts, left, associate justice stephen breyer and associate justice elena kagan listens as president donald trump delivers his first state of the union address on jan. 30, 2018.
but it's important to be clear about who these people are ― and why they'd be moving. for the most part, experts say, it'd be low-wage workers who will be moving voluntarily, because subsidized insurance would be much cheaper.
a contentious gop senate primary in wisconsin has caused a rift in the state's republican party. businessman kevin nicholson is running against state lawmaker leah vukmir in the gop primary to take on sen. tammy baldwin (d). a huge outside donor, richard uihlein, stepped in to help nicholson's campaign, while vukmir has been backed by gov. scott walker's political machine.
and apparently, the trump organization offers quality health insurance! good for the trump organization! this is how one leading expert in workplace benefits described it to salon earlier this year:
but her individual success does not make her some kind of feminist superhero.
we were disappointed by the court's recent ruling, seema verma, center for medicare and medicaid services (cms) administrator, said. as a result of this litigation, billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold. cms has asked the court to reconsider its ruling, and hopes for a prompt resolution that allows cms to prevent more adverse impacts on americans who receive their insurance in the individual and small group markets.
smoke and mirrors on preexisting conditions
it's possible that the supreme court chooses a middle-of-the-road option, ruling that some of the aca is severable from the individual mandate ― a result that could lead to some of its provisions surviving while others do not.
michelangelo signorile is an editor-at-large for huffpost. follow him on twitter at @msignorile.
the letters in that treasury department study went out right before the trump administration took over ― which is important because president donald trump began attacking the law on literally his first day in office.
permanent spoiler alert: we simply can't imagine anyone other than donald j. trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. but we won't get tired of him winning. believe me.
there have been over 125,000 coronavirus-linked deaths in the u.s. and more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of the virus nationwide, according to data compiled by johns hopkins university. the number of known cases globally has surpassed 10 million.
the obama administration opposed state efforts to implement work requirements in medicaid because it could result in fewer people having access to health insurance.
the problem is that trump has styled himself as a different sort of president. like that focus-group participant averred, trump voters think they elected a smart businessman who won't let bad things happen. he's supposed to be a swashbuckling outsider who'll start cutting through washington's thicket of idleness and start delivering better deals to the american people.
in january, trump revived an idea that has been popular with republicans for years: converting medicaid from an entitlement program with open-ended funding into a block grant that caps annual spending. the administration touted the flexibility this allows states to redesign their programs.
clearly, mekelburg wasn't going to stop.
it's notable that trump unveiled his proposal the night after his super tuesday triumph over cruz and rubio and the night before another republican debate. it also comes as he maneuvers toward a general election campaign against whoever wins the democratic nomination, former secretary of state hillary clinton or sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.).
we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom ― and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair.
a judge ruling in favor of the lawsuit could always limit a decision so that elements more loosely related to coverage remain in place. that would be consistent with the widely accepted legal conventions of severability: judges who find a law unconstitutional are supposed to find the least disruptive remedy possible.
republicans at both the state and federal level have been trying to gut or kill the law since then-president barack obama signed it into law in 2010.
scott eisen/getty images pete buttigieg's health care proposal is termed medicare for all who want it.
then she went home to tweet.
under the affordable care act, insurers are required to reduce deductibles, copayments and other forms of cost-sharing for the lowest-income enrollees who use the exchanges, and the federal government is supposed to reimburse them for the lost money. in 2014, however, house republicans sued then-president barack obama's administration, arguing that the federal government was making those payments without authorization from congress. a federal judge last year agreed with the gop lawmakers, and the obama administration appealed. when trump became president, his administration became the defendant in the case. the two sides soon obtained delays from the appeals court while they decided how to proceed.
i wasn't there. i haven't seen what she said. and honestly, i don't really care, rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) said thursday, because i know nancy pelosi, i know her commitment to doing something big on climate, and i know her record.
healthcare.gov and state-run marketplaces, like covered california, will continue to exist and offer coverage to people who want to buy comprehensive coverage. in addition, plenty of insurers will continue selling comprehensive coverage directly to consumers, as they do now, either directly or through private websites and individual brokers.
many of the issues that baldwin emphasizes when she's back home aren't traditionally partisan either. with the dairy farmers in altoona, talk centered around her dairy pride act ― which would bar competitive products like almond and soy milk from being labeled milk ― and an amendment she successfully included in the recent budget deal that provides help for dairy farmers.
he's living in a dream world, biden said of trump's rosy predictions of the pandemic. the former vice president then turned to the trump administration's court fight to overturn the obamacare health coverage law — including its protection for people with preexisting conditions — without having a replacement plan.
idaho has an unusual relationship with the affordable care act.
gaffigan also urged trump voters to apply that same test to their own actions ― specifically to who they vote for in the coming presidential election.
the pushback in aurora suggests republicans may be in for a world of political pain as they push forward with repeal. it recalls a few other popular uprisings against washington, all of them triggered by congressional efforts to make big changes to health care and entitlement programs. in the summer of 2009, hundreds of thousands of people swarmed town halls in opposition to obamacare. in 2005, the nation loudly pushed back against gop attempts to cut or privatize social security, contributing to the democratic takeover of congress in 2006. in 1993, when president bill clinton tried to rewrite the rules for the health care system, the insurance industry was able to exploit popular fears of change and scuttle the effort. the failure contributed to the gop takeover of congress in 1994.
at the time, and later during testimony for the federal lawsuit, aetna officials said that the company was simply explaining its business position ― that, without the economic benefits of the merger, it could not afford to sustain losses in the obamacare exchanges.
last month, macarthur authored an amendment that helped bring a substantial number of house conservatives on board to the gop health care bill, leading to its eventual passage last week. the provisions of the so-called macarthur amendment would allow states to waive essential benefits such as maternity care and emergency room visits. it would also allow states to opt out of obamacare's community rating rules, which require that insurers charge the same price to consumers in a certain area regardless of gender or pre-existing condition.
pre-merger integration was stalled and incomplete, the judge said.
none of the current proposals would prevent the later enactment of a single-payer medicare for all plan. but pelosi's emphasis on preserving and improving the affordable care act highlights the split between the democratic establishment and progressive leaders, including presidential candidates like sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.).
the trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. the per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, holahan said.
t.j. ducklo, national press secretary for the biden campaign, offered huffpost a similar statement: vice president biden believes quality, affordable health care in america is a fundamental right that should be guaranteed to everyone. full stop. he's fought for those values his entire career, and he'll do it again from the white house.
we've got the emails; we've got the letters; we've talked to people in the halls, rob olson, the republican who sponsored the state senate's version of the legislation, said during the floor debate. (he declined to answer questions directly from huffpost.) they can't afford the health care, their premiums are skyrocketing.
still, doma, which prohibited same-sex couples from getting federal benefits, raised important questions about basic human rights and was already constitutionally suspect. the supreme court would go on to strike it down just two years later.
if some of former vice president joe biden's talking points against medicare for all sound familiar, they should. he borrowed them from republicans.
donald trump has made it clear. he's got joe biden on his mind, the narrator says in the 30-second clip.
one is a call to substantially increase the financial assistance available to people who buy private insurance through covered california, which is the online insurance marketplace that the state runs as part of the affordable care act.
the white house did not respond to huffpost queries about whether trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.
but lynch isn't campaigning like he's facing a serious challenger; he's raised less money this cycle than he has in the past three. the official campaign arm of the democratic party doesn't appear to be on the ground. groups like justice democrats, which boosts progressive challengers to entrenched democrats, are focusing their resources in a race on the other side of the state, where local mayor alex morse is challenging the high-ranking democrat rep. richard neal.
when people ask, i speak about him, tipirneni told huffpost. even then, tipirneni does not dwell much on trump as a person. she criticizes the president in the context of his work with congressional republicans to pass policies tipirneni opposes, such as the tax cut legislation, which she calls atrocious.
question #2: why are bernie's fans so angry at hillary when hillary's fans aren't angry at bernie?
it's impossible to say definitively how big an impact the proposed changes would have, or even when or if they will take effect. like all new regulatory shifts, they must first go through a formal review process, with opportunity for public comment, before they become final.
i'm not urging you to become democrats. i'm not even trying to win an argument. i simply want our political arguments to make sense in the world of reality, the better to move our country forward with the goodwill and considered judgment required by these challenging times.
an analysis of labor department filings shows that the number of nursing mother cases has generally been rising, perhaps because more women have become aware of their rights under the law and are filing complaints. among the cases released to huffpost, only 42 were investigated in 2011, the year after the law was enacted. more than 70 were investigated in 2017.
he rewrote the affordable care act. not just once, but twice, sen. mike lee (r-utah) said of roberts. it is inexcusable that he did that.
democrats have the ability to seriously undermine the no collusion narrative. in the report, mueller noted that collusion was not even something they specifically looked at, opting instead for the legal definition of conspiracy.
for sure it is problematically ironic that black lives matter was birthed during the two terms of the nation's first black president. for sure, i do believe that even the explosion of police and civilian murders of black bodies was likewise a backlash to the obama years, be it george zimmerman gunning down black teenager trayvon martin, or dylann roof blowing away black folks in a prayer circle he had joined in that charleston, south carolina, church. these are acts of racial terrorism, designed to create fear, paranoia, a sense of doom.
the gop has given america, potential terrorists and the insane a license to kill. and what is the effect?
now that the very expensive, unpopular and unfair individual mandate provision has been terminated by us, many states & the u.s. are asking the supreme court that obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a far better and much less expensive alternative..... — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 27, 2020
carla seaquist's latest book is titled can america save itself from decline?: politics, culture, morality. an earlier book is titled manufacturing hope: post-9/11 notes on politics, culture, torture, and the american character. also a playwright, she published two plays of life and death and is at work on a play titled prodigal.
ilene johnson, a veteran party member, said a recent meeting in greensboro was standing room only. and at a breakfast meeting there, 70 people showed up. fulton county, cobb county and dekalb county democratic meetings are packed. but dekalb and fulton are majority dem. [greensboro is] not, neither is cobb. my mailbox is full. i have more volunteers. i'm swamped, she said.
as for the aca, a 2014 brookings institution study found that obamacare will ease income inequality over time by boosting the average income of the country's lowest earners. another study by the urban institute found that the law will help close the coverage gap between white people and people of color.
but the converse is also true. at least some democrats skeptical about medicare for all remain very passionate about universal coverage. they simply worry the sanders legislation would be too disruptive, as policy, politics or both. at worst, they think, it could alienate voters whose would otherwise support less ambitious, but still significant reforms.
all claim they're not making enough money because too many people with serious health problems are using the obamacare exchanges, and not enough healthy people are signing up.
they'll float ideas in op-eds ― and sometimes more serious policy writers on the right will think up different schemes that, in some hypothetical political universe, might come close to providing the kind of protections that the affordable care act has. but these ideas ultimately require similar combinations of spending, taxes and regulations, and in real life, republicans are simply not interested in that.
(that said, we must make exception for those who've directly authored or stirred the hate, from whichever side. by all means, let's oppose and discipline them openly as an example to all.)
bollier, a state senator, wants to be the first democrat to win a kansas senate seat since the 1930s.
obamacare in michigan, by the numbers
trump's budget would also shred last year's hard-won budget deal between the white house and pelosi by imposing an immediate 5% cut to non-defense agency budgets passed by congress. slashing cuts to the environmental protection agency and taking about $900 billion out of medicaid over a decade are also nonstarters on capitol hill, but both the white house and democrats are hopeful of progress this spring on prescription drug prices.
the obamacare contraceptive mandate requires that employer-provided health insurance include coverage for birth control with no co-payment. previously, many employer-provided insurance policies did not offer this coverage.
state innovation grants: the bill includes funding for $100 billion in block grants to states for state innovation programs over fy2018-2026. these funds could be used to provide support for high-risk individuals, stabilize individual markets, reduce the cost of obtaining coverage in the individual markets, and to reduce out-of-pocket costs for individuals or make payments to providers for health care services.
at a minimum, a ruling against the affordable care act would eliminate the most popular part of the law president barack obama enacted in 2010: the ban on health insurance companies rejecting people or charging them higher premiums because of pre-existing conditions.
willingboro, n.j. ― rep. tom macarthur (r-n.j.), who helped revive efforts to repeal the affordable care act, on wednesday became the latest republican lawmaker to face angry voters at a town hall, just days after he voted for a house bill that would make sweeping changes to the nation's health care system.
for mcconnell and gop senate candidates, at least, the plan, from a while back, has been to grab onto trump and back all of his ugly, racist rhetoric, hoping he'll keep them afloat.
people buying coverage in the exchanges would also have a new way to get insurance: through a new government-run insurance plan. this is basically the public option that liberals had desperately wanted the aca to include, partly because they believed it would use the government's pricing power to pay less to the providers of medical care than private insurance does.
amy stephens applies her abundant energy in leading her colleagues, listening to constituents, mentoring new representatives, and raising support for her fellow republicans. she fights for her values and for the people of colorado. her honors and awards are numerous, but she values the affirmation of her constituents and the respect of her colleagues far above any plaque or title.
there is nothing in barrett's history that would indicate that she's spent any time empowering women.
within the democratic party, at least, the primaries settled the debate in favor of attempting more sweeping reforms. but not long after obama became the nominee, the argument among democrats shifted to a first-year agenda and how much emphasis to give health care in that time frame. during the transition, obama heard from multiple advisers who wanted to wait on a major reform, and one of them was biden, who thought the american people recognized that, with the economy in crisis, circumstances had changed since the campaign.
many of democrats' ads focus on going after gop lawmakers for their plans to repeal the law.
the davidson county democratic party in tennessee maybe gets 10 people, beyond the executive committee, at its regular meetings. but in january, it had nearly 200 people show up, and 180 people filled out forms to start volunteering.
the majority of college graduates are now women, as are the majority of students enrolled in law school. that was close to unimaginable when ginsburg was one of just nine women in her law school class at harvard.
the proposal would wipe out much of the affordable care act's funding, including new payroll taxes that fall exclusively on the very wealthiest americans. to make up for some of that loss, the bill would start subjecting a portion of the most generous health plans to taxes. today the premiums for employer-sponsored insurance do not count toward taxes, so this would effectively be a new tax on the most expensive insurance policies, which many middle-class people hold.
to achieve this result, these plans would require everyone in the united states to give up their current sources of coverage, whether it's private health insurance purchased on the exchanges set up by the affordable care act, job-based health benefits or already-existing government programs like medicare and medicaid.
of course, mchenry's feelings were not actually injured. he was just trying to save the ceo of america's largest bank from a viral video embarrassment. he had strategically weaponized comity in pursuit of a political goal.
former marine fighter pilot amy mcgrath won the democratic nomination to take on senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in november after holding off a late charge from progressive state rep. charles booker in kentucky's democratic senate primary.
but richard dean's story doesn't end there. this last november, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. and the second time the government shut down, he continued helping social security recipients, but he was working without pay. on behalf of richard dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the american people, i challenge all of you in this chamber: never, ever shut the federal government down again.
as other surveys have shown over the years, support for single-payer health care and for the public option is malleable and can vary depending on how questions are asked and what arguments for or against are included.
jay hancock/khn zann nelson, who fought back in court against a uva health system lawsuit, lost her case after a judge said she had the ability to decline the surgery needed for cancer if she didn't agree to uva's terms.
her vote against devos meant vice president mike pence had to come to the senate to break a tie. and her opposition to kavanaugh was as significant as it was dramatic. the outcome was going to be close, and nobody knew what murkowski planned to do ― including her staff ― until the senate held a procedural vote to advance kavanaugh's nomination. when her name was called, murkowski stood up at her desk, looked dead ahead and said in a barely audible voice, no.
so, expanding markets, single payer, giving people more choice of carriers, all the proposals that were made are still insurance-based products run by insurance companies. if affordability is the key, the only way to achieve it is to rein in insurance costs. this will only happen if we regulate the percentage of administrative costs allowed by subtracting from the premium dollars received the money paid for medical expenses and services rendered (money in minus money out).
that could play into pushing her new transition plan ― 'i know how to get this done and i'm totally committed to it,' he imagined her saying. 'and what do you know how to do, mayor pete?'
but although the tax bill may not drag republicans down, it appears unlikely to prove much of an asset in the midterms either — which still leaves the gop in distinctly bad shape.
would the republican plan make access better? almost certainly not.
association health plans are policies that allow small companies in the same industry to band together to buy health benefits for their employees. these already existed before trump, and before the affordable care act became law in 2010.
hers is a story of personal triumph. it's also a story about policy success, because it's possible she wouldn't be where she is today without the medicaid expansion. but that success won't last, and future substance abuse patients might not be able to get the care that barnes has, if the republican crusade against obamacare doesn't relent.
nearly two decades ago, for example, kavanaugh suggested during a roundtable discussion that the supreme court's unanimous ruling in the 1974 u.s. v. nixon case that forced richard nixon to turn over the watergate tapes ― a landmark case that led to the president's resignation ― may have been wrongly decided. democrats seized on the comments over the weekend, arguing that they fit a larger pattern that shows that kavanaugh's preference for a strong executive branch could affect special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
here, for example, is what aetna chairman and ceo mark bertolini said to sylvia burwell, then the secretary of health and human services, during a july phone conversation: if, by chance, you get a reach-out from the [justice department] about us as a candidate for this merger, i would appreciate a good word for all that we've done with you.
i would canvass for a ham sandwich to keep ralph norman out of congress. michele horne, 42
the huffpost pollster average, which aggregates all available polls, shows trump with an even larger lead in iowa: 32 percent of the vote versus cruz's 24 percent.
it brings cost-consciousness to every healthcare decision because there is no big pocket in the background, said brase, whose group doesn't oversee any health cost sharing programs but supports the concept and the organizations.
from the start, mekelburg turned to racist far-right conspiracy and propaganda sites such as infowars and gateway pundit as sources. she bashed welfare and obamacare and fast food workers striking for higher pay. she mocked liberals for supporting trayvon martin, the black teenager shot to death by george zimmerman. she fearmongered about immigrant rape gangs and government gun grabs, often attaching hashtags such as #tcot (which stands for top conservatives on twitter) and #pjnet (patriot journalist network) that would soon be widely used by kremlin-controlled troll accounts. her main target was the tyrant barack obama, whom she branded an illegal alien and a jihadist. she tweeted that obama's evil is limitless.
bookhart, who lives near parnell campaign headquarters in rock hill, embodies the way the campaign is paying dividends for the democratic party in the state. after learning from a campaign staffer that ex-felons are allowed to vote in south carolina, she registered an estimated 100 former felons in her neighborhood to vote.
it's like after thanksgiving 2016 we all decided to let the crazy relative decide the discourse and context of every argument, he wrote. it was refreshing to let four years of frustration boil over and offer some straight talk on what trump has done to our country or our democracy.
david gergen, a cnn political analyst who advised gop presidents richard nixon, gerald ford and ronald reagan — and democratic president bill clinton — said he found the speech deeply disturbing with little change from trump's bombastic, divisive campaign messages.
his statement contradicts president donald trump's claim that the number of confirmed cases has skyrocketed simply because more tests have been made available.
the lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in texas, comes from officials in 20 conservative states. and its prospects for success look slim. the supreme court has already rejected two legal challenges to the law, the second on a 6-3 decision that came with a strongly worded ruling from chief justice john roberts.
dny59 via getty images under medicare for all, the federal government could negotiate directly with drugmakers over prices.
while it isn't clear where they stand on the constitutionality of the mandate, based on their questions today ― which of course cannot predict anything with certainty ― it seems likely they would vote to uphold the rest of the aca even if the mandate is struck down, abbe gluck, a yale university law professor, told huffpost.
on tuesday, indiana democrats greeted braun at a campaign event in mishawaka waving chinese flags. party spokesman michael feldman criticized braun in a press release for relying on chinese auto parts instead of indiana manufacturers who have suffered at his expense.
all of these decisions are not only financial; they are existential. you owe it to yourself to spend more effort making them than you do on choosing a cell phone plan. and that's the savage truth.
at least two republicans, rep. jason chaffetz (utah) and rep. dave brat (va.), have insisted that upset constituents are paid protestors. they've offered no evidence of the claim.
two years later in wake of president obama's reelection, individuals from 40 states—following the lead of louisiana—petitioned the white house to peacefully withdraw from the union. texas lead the way with over 125,000 signatures, though three other states (tennessee, alabama, and north carolina) secured over 25,000 signatures. it is not clear that those signatures came mostly from texas or from residents in other states hoping for texas' withdrawal.
this dangerous action could take us back to the days when people with pre-existing conditions were openly discriminated against and blatantly denied access to lifesaving care. statement from 29 patient advocacy groups
it feels like a narrow victory, even if biden also holds his current leads in arizona and georgia, because both the electoral college itself and the results within those tipping states are genuinely close. but those thin margins are a product of the geographic distribution of the population and belie the much larger margin in the popular vote.
but fluke wasn't necessarily supposed to speak before the panel in the first place. if it weren't for another student's class schedule, she could still be just another unknown policy wonk today.
other groups weighed in — massively. the joint committee on taxation — a nonpartisan congressional team of experts that assesses tax topics for congress — supplied politicians with 62 reports over 21 months. the congressional budget office and the congressional research service wrote 10 more. one report was titled blacks and tax reform: possible impacts on blacks of selected proposals of hr 3838.
the two biggest legislative initiatives of trump's first term ― the attempted repeal of the affordable care act and his massive tax cut bill ― exemplified this deference to the big-business libertarianism of ryan and mcconnell.
at this time two years ago, i couldn't wait for november, just to get it over with and end the craziness. i was fairly confident that something sinister wouldn't prevail. after that election, even with all the energy among progressives now, no one can say that again.
over 90 percent of judge kavanaugh's record has not been received by the senate and may never be, schumer said. the republican majority is deliberately obstructing the senate's constitutional duty to fairly and thoroughly conduct our advise and consent powers. ... so i object.
the poll came on the heels of the republican national convention, at which the party opted not to adopt a new platform and chose instead to reassert the party's strong support for president donald trump and his administration.
at her sister's suggestion, barnes enrolled in an addiction program at the western wayne family health centers, a group of federally funded clinics scattered across the lower-income suburbs of detroit.
the lawsuit has proven to be a particularly useful foil, because it put the issue of pre-existing conditions into the news at a time when memories of the 2017 repeal fight had started to fade, and because it directly implicates gop candidates in missouri and west virginia.
but the cbo is the only independent scorekeeper that's supposed to matter when lawmakers devise new policy. and the current director of the agency, keith hall, is a former george w. bush white house official who received his current position with ryan's and price's support.
al drago/cq roll call via getty images andy slavitt, the former acting administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid, has launched a new bipartisan health policy initiative.
q: is anybody besides sanders supporting it?
biden's proposal was more like a collection of incremental measures, larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation, said in a recent interview. this set of proposals certainly could have accomplished a lot in providing health insurance to people, depending on the details, levitt said. however, it's fair to say that biden did not have a comprehensive health reform plan like obama, clinton and edwards.
an america without a guarantee of legal abortion, they say, would be markedly different from an america before abortion became legal in the first place.
anyone with minor children living at home should check first to see if their kids qualify for medicaid or chip, as the children's health insurance program is known. (many states adopted different names for these programs. medicaid is called tenncare in tennessee, for example, and vermont's chip is called dr. dynasaur.)
even alongside the other changes, this latest regulatory move isn't tantamount to destroying the affordable care act, although trump has frequently suggested as much.
that was the gop made visible. using your middle finger you can trace from that point until it is pointing directly at trump.
many consumers will buy these plans thinking they are getting a great deal, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university, told huffpost before seeing the final rule. but if they need health care services and the bills start to pile up, they'll quickly discover that these plans cover very little.
rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) said the conference-call-lawmaking was not a good replacement for members actually having hearings and face-to-face input on bills. you just can't pretend that this is working well, huffman said. i think it's time to talk about the fact that the emperor has no clothes.
we're signing a health care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan that the supreme court decision on daca gave me the right to do.
the proposed regulation also seeks comment on the question of whether, somehow, these short-term plans should be renewable ― that is, whether insurers should allow people to stay on the same plans, year after year. of course, doing so would seem to mean they aren't really short-term plans at all, but rather an alternative form of long-term insurance that simply isn't subject to regulations protecting people with pre-existing conditions. in theory, that is not legal under the affordable care act.
without funding, millions of americans who buy their own plan will be harmed. many plans will likely drop out of the market. premiums will go up sharply ― nearly 20 percent ― across the market. costs will go up for taxpayers. and doctors and hospitals will see even greater strains on their ability to care for people. we urge congress and the administration to act now to guarantee funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies, said tavenner, who previously ran the centers for medicare and medicaid services.
and health insurance exchanges are growing, with nearly 13 million enrolled as of jan. 31, when the most recent sign-up period ended. subsidized coverage from these marketplaces and the expansion of medicaid under obamacare in 31 states and the district of columbia are the main reasons why an estimated 20 million more people have health insurance this year than before the affordable care act became law and the uninsured rate declined to a historic low.
most of the original architects of obama's presidential campaigns have no plans to work for biden or endorse him early in the primary, and some have moved on to other candidates. jen o'malley dillon, who held senior positions in obama's campaigns, is running former texas rep. beto o'rourke's white house effort, and joe rospars, obama's chief digital strategist, is an adviser to warren.
dating back to 2007, pence has quite a history on women's reproductive rights. at that time, pence fought to grant embryos in the womb equal protection under the 14th amendment. it was also the year he began his ongoing mission to defund planned parenthood. in 2010, he voted to prohibit funding for abortion under federal obamacare plans.
the draft bill, first reported by politico's paul demko, carries a feb. 10 timestamp, and republicans may have revised their proposal since then. the text does not indicate which lawmakers or committees are responsible for it, and there is a blank space where normally the legislation would include the bill's title.
he has called the case unmoored and absurd.
the research found that 15.9 percent of veterans participate in veterans choice. almost half of those participating have household incomes under $50,000 with 77 percent being over the age of 50. two-thirds of participating veterans report a chronic illness or ongoing condition as well.
the pair met in savannah on wednesday night for their second and final debate, lobbing charged attacks at each other as democrats spend heavily in the state in an attempt to flip the senate. polls are neck-and-neck, although the race could lead to a runoff if neither candidate secures 50% of the vote.
that theory may be beyond most members, but it speaks to the frustration lawmakers are having in doing their work.
it does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the act in place. justice brett kavanaugh during oral arguments on the affordable care act
the affordable care act (aca) postured toward the need for comparative research on health care services by establishing the patient-centered outcomes research institute (pcori). it was intended to pursue clinical effectiveness research (not cost-effectiveness), but it was hobbled from the start by specific bans in the legislation on any authority to dictate coverage or reimbursement policies. a recent study found that it has had minimal impact, with only one-third of its funding going to clinical effectiveness research. (3) it will also disappear in 2019 unless reauthorized by congress.

above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the uss cole ― and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.
trump began sprinkling the term obamagate into his public statements last week after his attorney general decided to drop charges against trump's first national security adviser, retired army lt. gen. michael flynn, who had already twice pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi regarding his phone conversations with russia's ambassador after trump was elected but before he took office. trump's current acting director of national intelligence followed up by releasing a list of officials under then-president barack obama who had sought to learn details of those calls, and trump has now turned that list into an accusation that obama illegally spied on him.
a public policy polling survey released last week found that 49 percent of maine voters asked said they want to collins to reject kavanaugh, while 42 percent said she should vote to confirm him. when told that kavanaugh could tip the court against roe, 54 percent of respondents said they were less likely to support his confirmation, and only 24 percent said they were more likely.
but last year, the rand corporation, an independent think tank with its own model for projecting the effects of health care proposals, produced a detailed report on how the nyha might work out in practice.
these arguments may or may not be correct. but they certainly deserve a serious hearing, especially because medicare for all isn't just another idea on the campaign trail. it's got the endorsement of several democratic presidential candidates, including fellow front-runners, sens. kamala harris (d-calif.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.), and it's captured the imagination of the party's activist base.
mekelburg dropped some clues about herself on twitter. she and siino interacted in tweets during early 2013 but soon stopped replying to each other. and in july 2014, she posted a request for help in locating her cousin, who had gone missing in pennsylvania. in local news stories about the missing woman, mekelburg was quoted under her real name. anyone paying attention to @amymek would have made the connection to amy mekelburg.
five republican candidates are hoping to replace house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.), who is not seeking re-election. former ryan staffer and university of wisconsin regent bryan steil, whom ryan has endorsed, is favored to win.
progressive groups leading the fight against kavanaugh ― demand justice, moveon and naral pro-choice america ― are urging senate democrats to release all committee confidential records that could potentially show that he lied under oath.
kavanaugh declined to answer sen. cory booker's (d-n.j.) questions about whether he believes race-conscious policies are constitutionally valid as a way to remedy past discrimination. moreover, he didn't say if he agreed with supreme court precedent on the issue.
the hhs official said the department would continue to answer email and telephone questions about enrollment. he added that radio and television advertising would continue to run where it was not possible to get the money back.
the affordable care act requires insurers to provide discounts on out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and copayments, to exchange customers with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, which amounts to about $30,000 for a single person. the government is supposed to pay the insurers back. trump won't.
we must keep america first in our hearts. we must keep freedom alive in our souls. and we must always keep faith in america's destiny ― that one nation, under god, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!
by then, medi-share had altered its financial model. instead of collecting sharing contributions, pooling them, and then distributing payments, it was creating individual accounts and redistributing money among them so that members could pay their medical bills. as a result, rosendale said, medi-share no longer qualified as insurance, and so was no longer within his office's jurisdiction to regulate. (rosendale's office declined to return phone calls seeking more explanation of the decision.)
a recent poll also found that 76 percent of voters, including 58 percent of republicans, say coverage for pre-existing conditions is very important to them.
barrett's appointment could have an immediate effect on several cases before the supreme court, including a lawsuit seeking to strike down all of obamacare that is due to be heard just days after the election, as well as several challenges to early voting accommodations in key battleground states such as pennsylvania and north carolina.
the skinny repeal, while a less robust piece of legislation, would still manage to do much of the same. the cbo has previously said that similar legislation would lead to 15 million fewer people with health insurance and 20 percent premium increases. the legislation would, in short, produce the sort of death spiral that republicans accuse obamacare of producing.
tom williams/cq roll call/getty images sens. dan sullivan and lisa murkowski, alaska republicans, consult on capitol hill. murkowski has a more moderate record, including a key vote against repealing obamacare.
more consequently, perhaps, trump dismissed the importance of masks and openly mocked biden for wearing one. he continued to do this, amazingly, even after the white house event for supreme court nominee amy coney barrett became a superspreader event ― and, even more amazingly, after he contracted the virus himself.
many republicans were reluctant to fully engage in post-defeat soul searching, noting bevin was still contesting the race. in the campaign's final days, the party increasingly worked to nationalize the race and inject culture war topics into the state's electoral bloodstream.
the new venture from amazon et al. isn't a radical intervention in the system but merely a natural evolution of what is already in place.
from that point on, the teacher movement, which included other public workers and labor unions from the beginning, and beshear — along with a kentucky democratic party hell-bent on not losing again, after ugly defeats in 2015, to bevin, and 2016, when democrats lost a centurylong grip on the state house — formed something of a symbiotic relationship that benefited them both.
new plans announced by california gov. gavin newsom, washington gov. jay inslee and new york city mayor bill de blasio this week also demonstrate that ideas short of single-payer could partially address the shortcomings of america's health care system ― and reach people the affordable care act did not.
republicans made it through a voter fraud scandal. now they're up against a blue wave.
there's a belief in the u.s., promoted mostly by business interests, that paid maternity leave is costly and hurts businesses. that's a myth, said milkman.
the white house had no comment on biden's expected order, but the two individuals familiar with the plan said the new enrollment period would not go into effect immediately. instead, the white house wants to provide time for the department of health and human services to mount a marketing campaign, and for insurers to get ready for an influx of new customers.
the health care law will survive, but it will be weaker
an updated version of this article was published on aug. 20.
congress has no authority to do that, the lawsuit says, making that provision unconstitutional. and because congress originally envisioned the mandate as an essential part of the affordable care act, the lawsuit argues, the entire program has to go.
the rules vary from group to group, but there are some basic tenets most follow.
q: oh, yeah. the republicans. what do they want to do?
conservative christian women, particularly those who are anti-abortion, told the the new york times how happy they were about barrett's nomination. she shows that it's possible for a woman to rise to the top of her profession while having many children, a stanford law school graduate and mother of 10 who heads a conservative legal advocacy group focusing on religious liberty told the times.
if the only goal is to reduce monthly premiums, the gop measures might sort of work for some people. selling insurance products that are cheaper because they exclude the sick and leave policyholders with huge coverage gaps isn't a very impressive trick. it's kind of like promising to make cars cheaper by selling them without transmissions and then declaring you've solved the problem of auto affordability.
one way to minimize that risk would be to cut hospital payments more selectively or slowly, although it's not so obvious exactly what that would mean. when huffpost put the question to experts and industry officials over the last few weeks, no two gave the exact same answer.
but it's been a different story in states like california and michigan, where officials have been enthusiastic and the markets have been stable. these are also the states that expanded medicaid early and where, as a result, the number of people without insurance has fallen to the lowest levels.
the arrival of retired marine gen. john kelly as chief of staff last summer was supposed to bring order and structure to the white house, and in some measure it has. oval office visits are now strictly controlled, as are phone calls through the white house switchboard during business hours.

i will be an active listener and participant in discussions with my governor, but i wholeheartedly believe the work requirement is necessary for healthy michigan to continue to function, he said.
in texas v. u.s., the plaintiffs contend that the mandate still exists, only now it's unconstitutional because with no monetary penalty attached it cannot be a tax. and because congress in 2010 believed the mandate was an essential piece of the law's framework, the lawsuit claims, the rest of the affordable care act must now come off the books, too.
the key is that a big shift over to subsidized insurance, to the point where large numbers of employers start dropping coverage, would happen only if subsidized insurance turned out to be a viable, attractive alternative ― which sounds a lot more like a change for the better than a change for the worse.
we think that cbo simply has it wrong, health and human services secretary tom price said during a press conference monday.
president donald trump on saturday promised a strong new health care plan for america at some point in the future, just over a day after his justice department called on the supreme court to kill the affordable care act.
medically frail, for example, doesn't appear to include people with serious chronic diseases that make jobs difficult to find and keep. and the new paperwork requirements will be difficult for some people to satisfy ― because they can't get the right documentation, for example, or because overwhelmed state offices won't be responsive to questions.
the tax cuts are likely to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit, according to the congressional budget office. if all the reductions become permanent, the impact will be even larger.
last week marked the nine-year anniversary of president barack obama signing the affordable care act into law. obamacare has its very real problems, chiefly that there remain millions of people who can't afford health insurance and medical care or are barely fitting it into their budgets. but the law also extended health coverage to something like 20 million people who were uninsured before, and it includes a guarantee that no one can be turned down for health coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
we must choose whether we will squander our inheritance ― or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans. we do the incredible. we defy the impossible. we conquer the unknown.
the race to replace rep. keith ellison, who is running for minnesota attorney general, includes a crowded democratic primary. state rep. ilhan omar, one of five candidates, won the state party's endorsement. omar's background as a former refugee and the first somali-american member of the minnesota legislature has made her popular nationally.
and that was illegal, senior u.s. district judge john bates ruled on friday. the affordable care act seeks to regulate insurance for individuals and small businesses, he noted. ahps may be exempt from those regulations, but only for small firms that are actually in the same line of business ― and that are small companies, rather than individuals.
that night, boyle dropped the recording of ryan saying he wouldn't publicly defend trump ― even as he was the republican nominee. in the article, boyle disclosed that breitbart news was provided a portion of the ryan conference call that included the speaker's remarks. he did not mention when breitbart news obtained the recording.
all of these actions have led to questions about whether the white house is taking the opioid epidemic seriously enough. i think they have highlighted the issue by appointing a commission and having [the department of health and human services] issue a health emergency, said regina labelle, the ondcp's chief of staff during president barack obama's administration. but little of substance has been done on the issue to date.

correction: a previous version of this article misstated that blankenship was convicted of a felony; he was convicted of a single misdemeanor.
moreover, the high cost of health care frequently discourages americans from seeking care, especially those who are among the 28 million uninsured. and sick people not being isolated and treated means they are at risk of spreading the coronavirus to more people.
before the 2010 law took full effect, people buying coverage on their own frequently couldn't get insurance if they had pre-existing conditions. and if they got seriously ill after buying a policy, they frequently discovered huge benefit gaps covering precisely the treatments they needed.
with veteran insights, consumer science, and social networking solutions we can put the veteran in charge, enabling them to have their cake and eat it too. value is defined uniquely by the veteran with ability to choose the best approach for me; quality of care, speed of service, convenience, and cost - all factoring into the equation.
if the ruling is allowed to stand, more than 20 million americans would be at risk of losing their health insurance, re-igniting a winning political issue for democrats heading into the 2020 elections. president donald trump, who never produced a health insurance plan to replace obamacare, is now promising one after the elections.
in his email, jorjani warned roddy that $4,000 for a six day advance in the virgin islands is not a small [sum] and will draw the [office of the inspector general's] attention. he added in parentheses: oig's love travel investigations. they are easy to document and spin in a negative way.
still, such pushbacks miss a far more important point. much like everything else he has done in his public career, romney's condemnation of trump isn't an act of principled conviction but rather of personal convenience ― one calculated for his own advancement rather than the common good. while flake and corker's objections to trump were largely about achieving partisan and ideological goals ― trump was making republicans look bad! ― romney is merely keeping with the self-serving flexibility that has always marked his political life.
i never thought i would presume to say this. i respect that your allegiance is rooted in considered beliefs and years of loyalty which, at the beginning of my political journey, i shared. i certainly don't think i have all the answers, and i enjoy exploring our differences. you inform me, correct me and, most generously, tolerate me. you care, as do i, about the world we are leaving the next generations.
trump himself published an op-ed last october in usa today under the headline donald trump: democrats 'medicare for all' plan will demolish promises to seniors. in the op-ed, trump makes a number of false and exaggerated claims about medicare for all. but it's this line that's most in sync with biden's rhetoric: the democratic party's so-called medicare for all would really be medicare for none.
a great deal of this appeal is driven by sanders outright rejection of traditional appeasement politics. hillary clinton continues to play both sides on major issues; calling for transitional continued use of carbon energy including fracking, tar sands, and deep sea exploration, while using tired rhetoric promising to prioritize action to address climate change by continuing policies which the unfccc and scientists have declared insufficient to prevent a greater than 2 degree rise this century and the serious adverse impacts from a warming climate which will thereby ensue. senator sanders is unequivocally opposed to fracking, tar sands and carbon subsidies. secretary clinton has campaigned on a policy to expand the affordable care act (obamacare) whereas sanders would institute a single-payer universal system like every other developed nation. secretary clinton would continue the war on terrorism as prosecuted by the obama administration and maintain or expand u.s. military intervention across the globe, international trade agreements, and so on. senator sanders has proven to be more restrained in his support for the projection of u.s. military

the pragmatic trump also came out against anti-gop establishment coal baron don blankenship (who was convicted of a misdemeanor offense and served a year in prison) in his bid for the gop nomination for senate in west virginia last month, tweeting that blankenship can't win and invoking the moore debacle. (interestingly, trump called blankenship after he lost his bid and reportedly offered his congratulations on waging the campaign ― perhaps still believing him to be a kindred spirit, even if he had to back his opponent.)
in the march 2017 exchange, released as part of an open records request posted to the department's website and first reported on by huffpost, jorjani raised concerns about an interior staffer's $4,000 six-day trip to the u.s. virgin islands. the former staffer, russell roddy, had traveled to the virgin islands in preparation for a trip that former interior secretary ryan zinke took that spring.
texas gov. greg abbott admits he should have slowed down reopening ― 6/27/20, 11:30 a.m. et
linda blumberg, senior fellow at the urban institute, decided to take into account how changes to financial assistance would interact with other changes that republicans propose, like allowing insurers new flexibility over what to cover and how much they could charge. if such a plan became law, blumberg concluded, it would be impossible for most lower-income people to purchase adequate health insurance coverage, given their limited financial resources and potential medical needs.
jackson had separated the justice department's case into two trials. her ruling focused only on the first one in which the justice department argued that the tie-up would hurt the ability of large national employers to get competitive rates for the health coverage they provide workers.
not unreasonably, the base came to believe that our governmental and financial institutions -- including the republican party -- were controlled by an elite that was indifferent to their plight. and so demagogues like donald trump and ted cruz became the agents of their frustration and despair. like the sorcerer's apprentice, the party lost control.
the trump administration filed a brief thursday night asking the supreme court to invalidate the affordable care act, threatening health care coverage for 20 million americans as the nation smashed a record for new covid-19 cases in a single day.
eligibility for subsidies is based on projected annual income, not current monthly income like medicaid and chip. unemployed workers must account for their earnings prior to their job losses, along with their unemployment insurance payments. the $600 weekly unemployment boost also counts toward this total, but the $1,200 tax rebate doesn't.
when people are in the risk pools, then everyone else's insurance [premium] comes down, he said.
asked by sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) whether presidents have the absolute right to pardon themselves, likely referencing trump, kavanaugh called it a hypothetical question that i can't begin to answer.
even with that special dispensation, the ministries were not free to operate everywhere, because they previously had run afoul of regulators in some states. in one case, montana's insurance regulator blocked medi-share from his state following some payment disputes, including one in which a former pastor ended up with unpaid medical bills following a heart attack.
the repeal-and-replace bill house republicans passed in 2017 would have led to more than 20 million additional uninsured and higher health insurance premiums for anyone not lucky enough to be young and/or healthy. the senate version, which failed to pass, would've produced similar results.
after nine years of playing defense on obamacare, democratic leaders at the state and local level want to go on offense when it comes to health care.
in wednesday's ruling, the 5th circuit judges endorsed the argument about the tax and the mandate's constitutionality. the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the judges wrote.
there's a reason for all of that. health care (as trump famously acknowledged after taking office) really is complicated. and protecting people with preexisting conditions isn't simply a matter of issuing some kind of executive edict.
trump called his plan very complicated stuff, but insisted, we're going to get a health bill passed, we're going to get health care taken care of in this country.
the january meeting had a phenomenal turnout, said viehmann, a precinct executive in anderson. the resurgence of the democratic party is very clear here in my eastern suburb of cincinnati, ohio. lots of new people are not only turning out to protests. they are also learning about our local and state elections and swamping our elected officials in d.c. with postcards and phone calls.
despite the criticisms, hopp and brase said the ministries provide an alternative for people who want a more affordable, faith-based healthcare system.
the public is blaming trump for the mess, according to polls by huffpost/yougov and other news outlets. to be clear, no one in government comes out looking especially good during a shutdown, but he is being held responsible (as he once said he wanted to be).
in 2017, trump tried to repeal the aca legislatively and replace it with a bill that deregulated insurance rules and eliminated federal funding for the aca's expanded coverage. those provisions are likewise endangered by the trump administration's lawsuit before the supreme court.
in the absence of a deep substantive commitment to the details of the bill, the fallback rationale for passing it ― not just from the white house, but from other gop leaders as well ― is that republicans have to act because they promised to do so.
associated press president donald trump supports the lawsuit and has justice department lawyers arguing on its behalf, even though he says he wants insurance for everybody and great health care.
the same way nixon signed off on what was then the liberal domestic agenda, trump signed off on the paul ryan agenda, said lind, author of the new class war.
that was something that totally terrified me is how was i going to be able to afford this without insurance coverage, said daniels-lewis, 58. i've been on treatment for almost 24 years, and all of a sudden i'm faced with not having anything.
but we must expand our moral imaginations to understand and empathize with all people who are struggling, not just black folks who are struggling -- the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender person, and yes, the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change, and feels powerless to stop it. you got to get in his head, too.
the next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs ― and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said that obama encouraged democrats to work with republicans on health care ― but only if the gop's plan would achieve levels of insurance coverage similar to what the affordable care act provides, which none of the gop proposals so far has ever aimed to do. if they have in their replace something that works and gets results, then we shouldn't be opposed to that, she said obama advised them.
according to a poll taken around the time the affordable care act was passed, 35 percent of americans expected the legislation to hurt them personally. the tax plan faces similarly inauspicious numbers — 32 percent expect it to make things worse for them according to a recent huffpost/yougov poll, while 37 percent say the same in cnn's survey. according to two other polls, from quinnipiac university and monmouth university, between 44 and 50 percent of respondents expect their own taxes to rise.
columbia, south carolina — on martin luther king jr. day, a majority of the democratic presidential candidates were on the steps of the statehouse awkwardly stumbling through the words of lift every voice and sing, the black national anthem. sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.), rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) and former massachusetts gov. deval patrick sang the words they knew. former vice president joe biden and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) kept their lips sealed yet nodded along. billionaire tom steyer enthusiastically belted a majority of the words, stumbling and playing it off a few times.
the experts are saying it's highly unlikely they'll overturn the aca, he said. that's the consensus of many legal experts.
folks consider the area i'm in to be a deeply red area, but i think it's more purple than folks give it credit. i think there's a lot of potential here, but we need to ramp up the leadership quickly, she said.
this article has been updated to include comments from josh peck and an unnamed hhs official.
people who have health benefits from a large employer wouldn't see their coverage disappear, but new employees could have to wait months for their coverage to start or shoulder the costs of any medical conditions they had before joining a company. employees at small companies could face higher premiums because insurers could go back to setting rates based on the health status of the workers on these plans.
lt. col. amy mcgrath, a retired marine fighter pilot who launched a long-shot bid for congress with a viral campaign video, won tuesday's democratic primary in kentucky's 6th congressional district.
in a sign of just how deep the uncertainty in the gop ranks runs, appropriations chairman rodney frelinghuysen (r-n.j.) told huffpost thursday night after the special conference meeting that he was undecided.
many of the candidates pledged to overhaul labor laws to make it easier for workers to join unions, and attacked both corporations and the political elite for weakening workers' bargaining power over the years. the candidates fielded questions directly from afscme members both in person and via video from around the country.
as nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor who has been among the lawsuit's loudest critics, wrote earlier this year, the act is now part of the plumbing of the health-care system.
republicans initially hoped the supreme court vacancy created by the death of liberal icon ruth bader ginsburg could energize their base and help shift the election's focus away from the coronavirus pandemic to friendlier partisan territory. democratic messaging discipline, however, has so far kept the debate focused on health care, the issue that helped them take control of the u.s. house in 2018 and still affords them a massive advantage today.
key moderate senators are watching kavanaugh's comments closely, like sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), who has warned about the disastrous effect obamacare's repeal could have on residents of his state. the west virginia democrat, who is facing a tough re-election fight in november, was spotted at kavanaugh's hearing earlier on wednesday, even though he does not serve on the judiciary committee where it is being held.
the evening also included remarks from ady barkan, a progressive medicare for all activist with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who endorsed sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) for president. there was no mention tuesday night of the single-payer health care proposal, which would grant government insurance to every american — a policy biden campaigned against. instead, barkan, whose appearance at the convention was championed by those in warren's and sanders's orbits, spoke around it.
other states, including colorado and oregon, have their own, somewhat less stringent restrictions in place, while california, illinois and washington are in the process of considering new ones, according to research by sarah lueck of the center on budget and policy priorities. in states like alaska and pennsylvania, which don't have strong rules in place, state officials are vowing to use what authority they have to monitor advertising material and stop brokers from selling these policies under false pretenses.
it's easy to lose coverage, said karen pollitz, a senior fellow at the henry j. kaiser family foundation. not so to put it back.
he trashed free-trade agreements that have been the bane of the organized labor movement since the early 1990s, promising to shelve an existing accord and renegotiate others in an effort to revive domestic manufacturing. he vowed to defend social security, medicare and medicaid from any cuts; empower medicare to negotiate bulk rates on prescription drugs; repeal the affordable care act while providing universal coverage through other means; and pass an infrastructure bill twice the size of what his then-democratic rival, hillary clinton, was proposing. he mocked the country's pay-to-play campaign finance system and the low tax rate paid by the paper pushers who run hedge funds.
the administration's rule also applies to religiously affiliated universities that provide health insurance to students.
and yet one of the biggest rips on donnelly as he fights to hold onto his senate seat this fall is that he is supposedly responsible for shipping jobs overseas. republicans have taken to calling him mexico joe,″ and the latest tv ad from his opponent, republican mike braun, depicts donnelly's family business shipping boxes that say contains hoosier jobs and to: mexico.
in the debate over the affordable care act in 2009, sarah palin, former governor of alaska and candidate for vice president, had this to say about the aca's coverage of physician visits for seniors to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues:
the average all-payer operating margin for hospitals as of 2017 was about 7 percent, but, like all averages, that data point accounts for both those hospitals making more and those making less ― including a whole bunch of rural hospitals that rely on higher payments from private insurers just to stay in business.
over the course of more than 90 minutes on stage with biden, trump repeatedly lied about and distorted both his and biden's records, but he did so in a relatively modulated voice. the debate moderator, nbc news' kristen welker, largely succeeded in preventing trump from speaking out of turn, thanks in part to rules that allowed the microphones to be muted. trump even managed to make some legitimate criticisms of biden's record on immigration reform and criminal justice policy.
these plans will be financially attractive, although some buying them won't understand the limits or will get sick or injured after purchase. in either case, they will end up with medical bills they can't pay.
at the same time, castro, who is polling at around 1%, was not guaranteed to feature in post-debate chatter. the punches he threw at biden mean he will be talked about ― something a candidate polling at 1% needs desperately. and another debate exchange made it clear castro isn't going to shy away from criticizing the other candidates.
mcclintock is probably best known for being one of environmental groups' biggest targets. as wildfires ravage the district year after year, mcclintock still questions whether humans are an accelerating force in climate change. instead, he uses the trump line on the forest fires, pushing for more aggressive forest management.
it started as a joke, or for those obsessed with conspiracies, a new obsession.
the latest to try it is mike bishop, a two-term michigan congressman who represents a relatively conservative district stretching from the detroit exurbs to lansing. in 2016, president donald trump won it by 7 percentage points. bishop's winning margin was more than twice as big.
robert james, who succeeded jones as president of the 1999 this year, said the union will endorse donnelly and that the braun campaign has never reached out. many of the union's rank-and-file members are republicans.
other analysts, who are more skeptical of gross's chances, maintain that sullivan is in better shape than trump in alaska and will be far harder to paint as an extreme partisan than gross thinks.
leftist van jones on cnn was stunned that trump on the matter of 9/11 failed to fault democrat bill clinton for passing up the opportunity to kill osama bin laden, or democrat barack obama for enabling isis. instead, trump focused gratuitously and solely on george w. bush. against jeb's my brother kept us safe after 9/11, trump rhetorically asked, what about before 9/11? at times, trump spoke plausibly of president bush's mistake, but then he suggested implausibly that bush lied about weapons of mass destruction. that could be the trump who lacks a tactical proofreader.
the protests, which followed a similar outburst in west virginia, were initially organized in a facebook group called ky 120 united, which brewer and another school employee had set up to link teachers in districts across the state. its membership ranks swelled to nearly 40,000.
former vice president joe biden likes to talk about the affordable care act and how, at the 2010 white house signing ceremony, he was the one who famously called the law a big fucking deal.
public opinion isn't static and sanders contends that skeptics will warm to medicare for all when they see what a good deal it is financially. to prove his point, he cites studies showing that his bill would reduce health care spending and, as a consequence, most people would save money.
for ossoff to win would be great, but i don't think it would shock the hell out of everybody, horne said. for south carolina's 5th to go to a democrat, nate silver ― bless his heart ― he wouldn't know what to do.
unlike her colleagues, sen. susan collins (r-maine) expressed concern about the change.
to build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount ― reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
the gop has not been able to figure out whether its plan will lead to coverage for more people, fewer ― or, as cohn tried to argue, it just doesn't really matter.
a short report issued by the congressional research service in late november concluded that, yes, presidents are not subject to the same rules on financial conflicts of interest as the rest of the executive branch. but that same report also said trump is potentially subject to the emoluments clause in the constitution, which prohibits officeholders from taking any gift from a foreign state.
yet another group of researchers focused exclusively on the medicaid expansion and found that its beneficiaries were less likely to die from cardiovascular problems.
[lynch] doesn't have a strong presence. he's not particularly outspoken on much of anything. i think there is fertile ground to not do as well as people expect. jonathan cohn, progressive massachusetts
show me the facts, show me the research. that's what my science background brings to the table, tipirneni said.
in february, when rep. rashida tlaib (d-mich.) called it racist for rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.) to use a black woman as a prop to deflect from lawyer michael cohen's criticisms that trump was racist, meadows exploded with outrage. the house oversight committee chair, elijah cummings (d-md.), responded by carefully coaching tlaib into an apology and a retraction, saying it was against congressional rules to insult another member of congress ― in this case, cummings' good friend meadows.
but sanders and his allies rarely mention that medicare for all would also restrict the flow of money into the rest of the health care industry, including the parts that aren't as easy to demonize in speeches.
aside from trade, trump's policy priorities followed the typical republican, trickle-down playbook: hostility toward government social programs, regulation of big business and taxes paid by wealthy people and corporations.
employers illegally retaliated against workers for asserting their rights in 22 cases, including the walmart case in carson city. the woman in that complaint said she lost her lunch breaks after she started pumping; she also said she was told to clock out when she needed to pump, even though another nursing mother was allowed to do so on the clock. in the end, walmart agreed to pay the woman $217 in back wages.
yeah, i read his book too, meadows said, acknowledging that the bill has improved.
amy zellmer minnesota state capitol in saint paul, mn
asked by cnn's jake tapper about the high-risk pool plan, kasich said it simply wouldn't work.
but there's enough confusing language in it ― including a reference to obamacare's individual mandate, which republicans just repealed ― to make the exact significance of many sections ambiguous. that's especially true because insurance regulation involves multiple, overlapping statutes, and even experts can't be sure how they are supposed to interact.
gov. matt bevin (r) made his name in bluegrass state politics as a tea party outsider, and throwing out the affordable care act was one of his most common refrains. he used it first during his unsuccessful primary challenge against sen. mitch mcconnell, now majority leader, in 2014, and then in his winning bid for the top position in the state last year.
and now the question is whether those differences will determine the fate of house republicans' american health care act.
many democrats now view abrams' campaign, which came up just short against brian kemp, a trump acolyte, as a model for future candidates. the party, which spent much of 2017 and 2018 caught in a debate about whether it should focus on mobilizing young people and voters of color or winning over suburban voters who are disenchanted with trump, views abrams as proof it doesn't need to be a choice.
last year, republican rep. dan bishop spent $6 million to win a narrow 51 percent to 49 percent win over democrat dan mccready in a district that trump won by 12 percentage points. bishop, known most for being the author of the famed anti-transgender bathroom bill in north carolina, lost the charlotte suburbs that trump had won.
in the gop primary race for staten island's house seat, trump, in a surprise tweet last week, came out backing incumbent daniel donovan (r-n.y.), who voted against obamacare repeal and against the gop tax bill. trump chose donovan over the district's former representative, michael grimm, a convicted felon with a cult following in new york city's gop-leaning borough and a man who has modeled himself and his campaign on trump.
but this racist propaganda serves real policy: trump and his advisers truly mean to keep america white ― and make it whiter. they are throttling legal immigration from nonwhite countries. they promise to end birthright citizenship without regard to our laws and constitution. they are proposing to keep legal immigrants from becoming citizens if they use public assistance for themselves ― or their children.
in both cases, constituent feedback over august was crucial to the sea change in congress.
rep. mike johnson (r-la.), chairman of the conservative republican study committee, said he hadn't heard about the administration possibly covering coronavirus hospital costs, but he didn't exactly sound opposed.
khn contacted uva directly on multiple occasions. we filed several public records requests for the number of cases involving medical debt and the total amount sought, as well as the total amount recovered. each time our request was denied.
when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
up until that point, i had been covered under my parents' health insurance as a student. however, the minute i took a leave of absence, the insurance company insisted that i lost my student status. my medical bills were sent to my parents — while i was in the hospital on the verge of dying.
under the trump administration's direction, republicans in congress prioritized bailing out massive corporations over helping small businesses and ordinary workers. the paycheck protection program, which distributed loans to small businesses that were trying to keep workers on payroll, ended up being a bureaucratic nightmare. had trump followed the lead of many european nations, where governments covered businesses' payrolls directly, the unemployment rate likely would not have skyrocketed to the degree that it did in the united states.
amy was like, 'oh, it fucking smells in here. these people are disgusting,' the second ex-friend said. she could see the woman was in there. the bathroom didn't smell.
since then, democrats have lost control of congress and the white house, and now face the likelihood that republicans will follow through on their promise to undo obamacare.
ocasio-cortez's campaign against crowley focused heavily on his history of fundraising from well-heeled donors and corporations. the movement against money in politics has gone much further. in total, 140 house candidates and members have taken a pledge not to accept corporate pac money, according to end citizens united, a pac that promotes the pledge.
if that sounds like republicans are going to cut the expansion, it probably should.
i would like to thank my staff both in washington and texas for all of their hard work on behalf of our constituents. i would also like to thank my family for their unwavering support and most importantly the people that elected me, he said.
one of the architects of the gop health care plan, rep. phil roe (r-tenn.), suggested republicans have wanted to protect people with pre-existing conditions all along.
mcconnell may be risking the health of some senators and essential workers in congress, but he will get his chamber back ― in some capacity ― and allow lawmakers to work on things such as coronavirus response legislation and appropriations bills.
trump said joe biden is, quote, talking about taking down the border wall. biden has specifically explicitly rejected that idea. he just said he'll stop further additional construction.
the reality is there's unsexy hard work that hasn't happened on the ground to get these things passed, and those are things that the people we're hoping to hire, and have hired already, understand well, he said.
i don't think that means we don't have big ideas that candidates put out and pursue them, kildee continued. but yeah, we have to make sure that we're not creating some sort of an expectation that electing a president means that the entire agenda is just sort of self-actualizing.
the making of a movement since roe
the figure is based on customary reporting standards used by hospitals across the u.s., swensen said.
every single one of us needs to stand up in support of improving and expanding our health care infrastructure, not weakening it. health care should not be for the privileged nor should it be partisan. providers need to be the voice reminding everyone to put our patients — the country's population — over politics.
i desperately did not want to talk about politics — my chest pains had eased considerably since the news drought. and i did want to meet this guy. i'd come to trust myself enough in the dating world to know that if we went out, i'd spot a misogynist quickly. nothing about him said classist woman-hating racist, so what was my objection? legislation i wasn't going to talk about?
after kennedy ripped rep. paul ryan (r-wis.) for calling the death of obamacare an act of mercy, kennedy characterized it as an act of malice. howard dean, the former chairman of the democratic national committee gushed: this is a kennedy who could be president, the globe noted.
collins, a self-proclaimed pro-choice moderate, has easily won reelection three times since taking office in 1997 and a democrat hasn't held her seat since 1979. but the backlash against her voting record in recent years suggests she could find herself in a close race this time around, and democrats are confident that trump's impeachment trial will resonate enough with voters to boost their chances of retaking the senate in november.
ted s. warren/associated press washington gov. jay inslee (d) called for a public option in his state.
governor and state house races like the one in virginia are more critical than ever because the redistricting process follows the 2020 census. if democrats can ride a new wave into power, the gerrymandering of 2010 can be rolled back.
u.s. hits record number of daily new coronavirus cases, 1 day after previous high ― 6/27/20, 1:10 p.m. et
senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) and minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.) come out in a similar place as murray.
some gop lawmakers have insisted that men shouldn't have to foot the bill for such services since men don't get pregnant. but bill cassidy of louisiana, who is a gastroenterologist, has a different take.
the dynamic in congress is that conservatives are intent on removing the expansion, and moderates are somewhat determined to keep it ― or at least some form of it. leaders have to either roll one side of the conference or somehow split the difference. either way, finding 218 votes in the house ― and, perhaps even more challenging, 50 votes in the senate ― might not be possible with the different demands that republicans have on obamacare.
donald trump is not that george washington visionary, he is not a savior, but if he were pushed by his rich cohorts in a saving direction....
but the moderators of the previous four democratic debates allotted significant time to the narrow question of medicare financing, and given the ongoing skirmishes over warren's plan, they are unlikely to let up on wednesday night. (after a town hall in las vegas on sunday, the media continued to pepper warren with questions about the policy, including questioning how it played with african american voters.)
congress left the rest of the law intact. ... that seems to be compelling evidence on the question. chief justice john roberts, pointing to the 2017 law that ended the individual mandate's penalty
countries with universal access provide comprehensive benefits with greater efficiency and value, at far less cost than in the u. s., and also with better outcomes. (8)
larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation, has said that the bill's promise of protection for pre-existing conditions is something of a mirage.
six in 10 of the newly insured said their coverage enabled them to get care they could not get before, according to a survey by the commonwealth fund. the same survey found that people with medicaid or private coverage through the health care law were able to find new doctors with roughly the same ease as those who had insurance already.
what i would tell you is, when you end up, as you had with the aca and almost every other law, where ... the insurance companies and pharma companies are sitting around the table quote-unquote bargaining for the end game, who represents the american public in that bargain?
the original plaintiffs in the case are maine gov. paul lepage (r), mississippi gov. phil bryant (r) and the gop attorneys general of 18 other states, led by ken paxton of texas. these officials, who brought the lawsuit in february, are seeking to have to entire affordable care act stricken.
the truth is that clinton has a solid set of prescriptives on both health care and shadow banking. but here's a hard truth: no democratic president is going to be able to enact any version of his or her policy agenda with a republican congress. either sanders or clinton will be playing defense on obama's legacy for at least one term in office. there is almost no chance of actual liberal legislating before 2020.
the seat was solidly red in recent years. a republican, who left to join walker's cabinet, had held the state senate seat since 2001. trump won the district by 17 points. walker called schachtner's win a wake-up call for his party.
as retired military, i'm on single-payer, government-run insurance, he said, adding that he knows sanders' medicare for all plan will work for americans. there are some veterans that are 100%, that can do some side jobs to make extra money. i'm not one of them. i'm giving every little extra i have for the campaign, trying to hope that sen. sanders makes it.
western wayne is a perfect example of what a difference the medicaid expansion can make. jeren stepp, the chief financial officer, says that in 2013 about half of its patients had no insurance. now, thanks to the medicaid expansion, that figure has fallen to about 10%.
this looked like it would throw the exchange markets into turmoil as insurers worried about financial losses would look to recoup them through enormous premium increases or even stop selling this kind of insurance at all.
#5: offer unconditional amnesty to trump supporters.
and that 2017 accusation was itself a continuation of trump's yearslong pattern of vilifying the country's first african american president and questioning his very legitimacy.
republicans and conservative tax analysts argue the racial disparity of who gets more money will equalize, and eventually the tax cuts will benefit everyone, despite race. they contend that giving heftier tax cuts to the wealthy leads to investment, which in turn creates jobs and boosts wages for everyone — a controversial theory, derided by critics as trickle-down economics, that was used to defend tax cuts passed under president ronald reagan in 1981.
that's because he spent roughly the last 13 years incarcerated. shealy, who's originally from philadelphia but moved to columbia with his family, spent two separate tours, as he describes it, in the prison system. he was released on dec. 31.
there will be a 25-minute break. kavanaugh is asked to return at 8:05 p.m. to speak with sen. cory booker (d-n.j.).
under a new budget agreement that democratic gov. gavin newsom and his allies in the state legislature reached over the weekend, california in 2020 will begin offering state-funded health insurance to undocumented young adults, reintroduce the individual mandate penalty for people who don't have insurance, and offer more financial assistance to people buying coverage on their own.
asked how republicans can repeal obamacare with nancy pelosi wielding the speaker's gavel, sen. pat toomey (r-pa.) said, very carefully.
immigration: as we approach the end of the obama presidency one of our greatest regrets is the failure of our leaders in washington to craft a comprehensive immigration reform program. instead, these last years have been defined by historic levels of deportations of undocumented immigrants--a policy that has torn apart families and communities. in an attempt to circumvent the intransigent opposition of congress to any humane reform of our immigration laws, president obama used his executive authority to support and expand programs such as daca and dapa. unfortunately, the supreme court--itself hampered by congressional inaction--recently failed to uphold the president's modest reforms, sinking hundreds of thousands of families into chaos. latinos are looking for a presidential candidate who will stop the deportations, uphold and expand president obama's executive actions on immigration, and rally congress to pass a fair and just immigration reform bill that includes a path to citizenship. nothing less will do.
less comprehensive insurance plans could drive up costs of treatments for conditions like mental illness by essentially forcing people to buy added coverage for treatment for their behavioral health condition. or, it may push them to select a more expensive plan with broader coverage in the first place. as cap points out, expenses people could incur by the year 2026 are not small:
biden is expected to sign an executive order thursday, said two people familiar with the plan, whose details were still being finalized. they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the pending order ahead of a formal announcement.
scott heins / getty images progressive challenger alexandria ocasio-cortez, center, celebrates with supporters at a victory party in the bronx in new york city after upsetting rep. joseph crowley in a democratic primary on june 26, 2018.
the honest argument for rescinding some or all of the affordable care act's insurance regulations, as these republicans want to do, is that the new rules have made insurance more expensive. and although the law has tax credits that discount premiums and lower out-of-pocket expenses for the majority of buyers, those tax credits aren't available to people with household incomes above four times the poverty line, which works out to about $100,000 a year for a family of four.
washington ― senate democrats are trying to get republicans back to the negotiating table over legislation that provides $1.1 billion to combat the spreading zika virus, but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) isn't budging.
think of this capitol ― think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.
black voters matter co-founder latosha brown told huffpost that those in the media need to change how they talk about black voters.
biden's support for obamacare reportedly wasn't always so strong. in the early years of the obama administration, the former vice president urged the president to avoid entering a protracted battle to reform the u.s. health care system so early in his tenure.
who knows what the final bill will look like? cornyn said tuesday. i'd be happy to have a comprehensive bill that 50-plus senators agree to, but if we can't, then the idea would be to come up with a core of pieces that 50 of us agree on so we can get to a conference.
the only question was how many would lose coverage and how weak those protections would get.
lamb was hesitant to draw any larger point from a public health emergency like coronavirus. this is pretty clearly an emergency, he said. so i probably wouldn't draw any general political lessons from it. but it's easy to see how politicians embracing this idea could lead to more openness for socialized medicine.
despite the challenges queer folks face in the south, jones believes voting is the instrument that can help uplift his community. he attributes his passion for voting to his 98-year-old grandmother.
to be clear, the lawsuit still has a long ways to go before prevailing.
gun violence. the gop slavishly follows the nra line. it has opposed any effort to curb gun violence, hiding behind paranoid nonsense about disarming all americans. its only answer to our unique and devastating mass slaughter is that more americans should carry guns -- quite literally, that the black churchgoers in charleston mowed down by a madman should have brought weapons to their place of worship.
i don't think [my investment fund] has anything to do with my role as a board member of the united states of care, he said.
but especially if republicans lose a house of congress, and maybe even if they don't, the programs that ryan has targeted may be safe ― at least for now. his ideas won't go away. but their popularity, or lack thereof, remains clear.
in another eye-popping insurance company benefit, the detroit news reported last week that daniel loepp, ceo of blue cross blue shield of michigan, was paid $19.2 million in total compensation last year, making him one of the highest-paid bosses of any health insurer in america. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) blasted loepp's high compensation at a time when nearly 800,000 michigan resident are going without health insurance.
altman wasn't the only regulator in boston wary of the change. lori wing-heier, who directs alaska's insurance division, said she thinks short-term plans can play a useful, if limited, role in the market. but with the new regulation, she told huffpost, i'm concerned that people will buy these policies, show up at the hospital for a condition they did not expect, and discover they are not covered.
developed in 1980 and approved for use in the united states in 2000, the abortion pill is really two pills — mifepristone, also known as ru-486, combined with a second drug, misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours later.
and it's not only trump engaging in this sort of deception.
she previously warned of kavanaugh's potential impact on health care access.
morrisey, the west virginia attorney general who is challenging incumbent democratic sen. joe manchin, also signed the brief. he supports repeal, as does scott, who is trying to unseat democrat sen. bill nelson in florida and has spent much of his time as governor fighting the law. mcsally, who is now running for an open seat in arizona, was in the house when it took up repeal. she voted yes.
want more? ignoring the glaring evidence of unequal law enforcement against blacks which, in some cases, includes unjustified police shootings. upholding a death penalty that disproportionately targets minorities and the poor -- not a few of whom turn out to be innocent.
these protections are wildly popular and help explain why republican efforts to repeal the law outright have repeatedly failed. but the new requirements have also made insurance more expensive, as insurers pay claims they might have avoided before. although the aca also created federal tax credits to cut the cost of premiums, the credits are smaller for people at higher incomes and cut off altogether for people with incomes above four times the poverty line (roughly $100,000 for a family of four).
a few days later, in washington, lois frankel, a democratic congresswoman from florida, banged a wire hanger on the table as she warned that whether roe is overturned completely or gradually chipped away over time it would mean a return to the days of coat hanger medicine.
comic jim gaffigan is explaining his surprising twitter rant against president donald trump that went viral last week ― and he's not backing down.
perhaps relevantly, the morning consult and politico poll was also the only survey not to explicitly identify the bill as being a republican proposal. the poll also found respondents were generally more positive toward president donald trump than in most other surveys.
i'm not aware of any particular industry that benefits from this, jorjani replied. i'd like to think the american people benefit from a...
for donald trump, corruption and attacks on the rule of law have been like breathing, and surviving the midterms unchecked will be the longest, deepest, most relieved breath he's ever taken. the corruption will balloon, and any accountability will shrivel.
no less than sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), whose 2016 primary campaign arguably mainstreamed medicare for all among democrats, also backed the idea of congress shoring up the aca rather than focusing all its energies on enacting single-payer.
both trump and gop lawmakers have sought to reassure the public that they support such provisions, even though they've long opposed them and failed to produce alternatives if obamacare is ultimately struck down.
people are energized in ways that they have never been before, he said. and our democrats group normally only meets once a quarter, but we have been meeting monthly since december and look to continue that for the foreseeable future.
presumably one reason sanders and jayapal haven't specified payment levels yet is that those are precisely the sort of financial details lawmakers would discuss and adjust once they took up a proposal more seriously, with firmer numbers in front of them. but if medicare for all advocates decided they had to go easy or slow on the hospital cuts, chances are good they would have to accept trade-offs like less generous coverage, higher taxes or higher deficits.
kavanaugh waffled, saying that he would come to any case with an open mind if it involved a constitutional question. he would not define an impeachable offense.
obamacare mandates: the bill sets the penalties for the individual and employer mandates under obamacare to $0, effectively eliminating these penalties.
the consequence of this kind of diminished access is clear when it comes to another medical service that provokes a religious backlash: abortion. the affordable care act doesn't require all health insurance companies to cover abortion, and it prohibits federal subsidies from being applied to that end. health insurers that want to cover abortion have to segregate the funds and pay for that coverage separately.
everybody has a teacher they can look back on and say they helped them and made a difference, said david patterson, communications director for the kentucky education association. and those people decided that this drumbeat of denigrating and attacking teachers wasn't going to fly.
trump built his presidential run, first and foremost, on anti-immigrant demagoguery of the kind eschewed by his party's chamber of commerce wing. but he also flouted long-standing conservative economic orthodoxies in ways that angered conservatives and inspired a mixture of ideological intrigue and political fear in some liberals.
there is a broad consensus within the broad progressive debate that health care is a right and that everybody should have health care, neera tanden, president of cap, told huffpost. and we recognize the virtue of a strong public plan available to all the people.
putting amy coney barrett on the supreme court would appear to be bad news for the affordable care act and the tens of millions of americans who depend on it.
biden asked members of the audience to raise their hands if they'd ever lost a loved one to a terminal illness. every second counts. it's not about a year, it's about the day, the week, the month, the next six months, he said. the truth of the matter is, it's likely to be a bumpy ride getting to where we're going.
how can someone be injured by a provision without any concrete consequence? katie keith, georgetown law school
the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda. it is the agenda of the american people.
but the administration also has taken some steps to quiet anxiety among health insurers that the exchanges next year won't function properly and that losses some have suffered ― and that drove some insurance companies out of the market entirely ― will continue. insurers have until late june to decide whether to sell policies on the exchanges next year.
the appeal for uninsured people could become much clearer if congress increases premium subsidies as part of its next virus relief package.
if the mandate has no practical effect, then it's difficult to comprehend how it can be a command to buy insurance ― in which case, there's no constitutional problem for the courts to solve.
promising to change the way we do business in washington
it is not clear how long the payment suspension will last or how different parts of the administration ― hhs, the white house and the justice department, which handles the litigation ― are coordinating their actions.
one of them is erica jackson, a texas woman whose daughter ran up more than $12,000 in medical expenses during an emergency room visit. as she told politico's paul demko and renuka rayasam in a recent article on the growth of sharing ministries, all but $3,700 ― her personal share, which is the ministry equivalent of a deductible ― was covered through the ministry. that's less than the out-of-pocket spending she would have had under many obamacare plans. they had it all under control, she said of the ministry.
aarp used its considerable political power to help pass obamacare in 2010, despite the opposition of many members ― about 400,000 left the organization in protest. aarp's objection to key elements of the republican bill to replace the landmark law could prove just as influential.
but progressives aren't complaining. they're not slamming pelosi, and they're trying to focus on where there is consensus, like on shoring up obamacare, lowering drug prices and building initial support for their environmental legislation.
a worker at an ihop in arkansas told her boss she would need to pump for 15 minutes roughly every two hours once she returned to work after having her baby. over the next 20 days, she received just two breaks and was told to pump behind a bread rack. her bosses told her nobody could cover for her, especially on the weekends. she quickly gave up on breastfeeding. an ihop spokesperson said the two locations that broke the law were run by franchisees.
but there's very little evidence to suggest kentucky's overhaul will improve health outcomes, and quite a lot of evidence to suggest it will actually worsen them. multiple studies, some of them focusing on kentucky specifically, have shown that giving people medicaid makes them healthier and more financially secure, which in turn makes it easier for them to find and hold on to jobs.
reversing roe would not make abortion illegal everywhere at once, but states — or even congress — could ban or further restrict it.
kennedy's replacement is justice brett kavanaugh, a trump appointee. his thinking on the affordable care act generally and this case in particular is not clear.
the battle for the first-in-the-south primary state, where black people make up around 30% of its population, is one that biden has often referred to as his firewall in his bid to win the democratic presidential nomination. he has long been forecasted as the front-runner to win the south carolina primary.
the repeal-and-replace plan, though, has failed to materialize since obamacare was signed into law nine years ago, even though the trump administration has argued in court that the aca protection for those with pre-existing conditions should be struck down.
(stokols subsequently tweeted that the man's last name is spelled feder.)
and i think the reason this gets under people's skin is that they basically saw eight years under obama where people talk about this metaphor of lucy and the football ― where democrats would try to operate in good faith, whether it was on obamacare in the [senate] finance committee and how long that sat there, or on the grand bargain on the deficit and the debt. and the second democrats would move to proverbially kick the football, it would get pulled away.
even as corporations plough tens of billions of dollars into share buybacks and stock repurchasing programs instead of raising wages or hiring more workers, president trump and congressional republicans are doing their best to portray their $1.5 trillion corporate giveaway as a boost to working americans, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said on the senate floor this week.
in michigan's gop primary, state attorney general bill schuette could beat lt. gov. brian calley after calley refused to align himself with trump. calley renounced his support for trump after audio of trump bragging about groping women came out during the 2016 election.
at the national level, republican control of the white house and senate prevents democrats from enacting their agendas. yet while even democratic state lawmakers could not get everything done that they wanted to, the examples below provide a glimpse of what they can do if they get the chance.
during the presidential debate with biden on sept. 29, trump continued to insist that he had a plan to provide universal coverage, but he offered no evidence to support that claim.
this is called the family glitch, and it effectively means there's no cap on what some families could spend on health care.
in other words, the whole law has to go — or, at least, big parts of it — because that is what congress surely would have wanted if it didn't have the mandate penalty in place.
trump's campaign has invested almost $19 million in tv advertising since mid-march, according to the kantar/campaign media analysis group's data.
josh peck, who worked on the last three open enrollment periods and just stepped down as chief marketing officer for healthcare.gov, told the huffington post that hhs did extensive research into which outreach efforts worked and tailored its campaigns accordingly ― focusing specifically on those most likely to yield the most signups. hhs found that simply reminding people of the final date, particularly by email, was the most effective tactic, peck said.
republicans are pushing a historically speedy timetable for confirming barrett, with a final vote expected just days from the nov. 3 presidential election.
look, give me a break on this thing, ryan said at his weekly news conference with other leaders when asked if he'd push through a clean zika bill. we passed the $1.1 billion bill for zika, which was the level agreed to in the senate. we did the responsible thing, he insisted, before accusing the senate of playing games.
it's estimated there are at least 50 health sharing ministries in the united states. a report by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) estimated those groups oversee about $60 million in healthcare payments a year.
again, i'm willing to sit down with anyone who wants to solve problems. but he's a lot of words and no action, she told huffpost. he's never taken a follow-up of calling [republican congressional leaders] mitch mcconnell or paul ryan and saying, let's work together on getting this through. then his infrastructure plan came out with no mention of buy america, which is horrifying to me.
if it prevails, roughly 21 million people could lose insurance because funding for expanded medicaid and private insurance subsidies would vanish. protections for people with preexisting conditions would also go away, while the entire health care system would be plunged into chaos because the law has such broad sweep.
what we're doing is we're going to be doing a health care plan — preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions ― as an example, yourself, it sounds like that's exactly perfect, trump said, lambasting efforts to protect obamacare by his democratic competitor, former vice president joe biden. that's exactly what we're talking about. we're going to be doing a health care plan very strongly and protect people with preexisting conditions.
savage, who runs the washtenaw county democratic party in michigan, said he's been making a point of reaching out not only to his new members, but to many of the people in the outside activist groups, to let them know that the party has resources that can help them organize.
the overall goal was to make biden seem like more than just another career politician. and it appears they succeeded in at least making the american public curious about biden.
at one point, the same official said, biden directly addressed the few advisers who were more enthusiastic about the health care endeavor, warning them that they did not understand the dangers and likely tradeoffs: it was just, 'we shouldn't do this. this will be terrible for us. i know politics, i know people, i've been doing this for 36 years. you are all well-intentioned, but you don't get it.'
a democratic poll found that the health care message was a winning issue in the race, with a majority of voters opposed to what the republicans wanted to do to the affordable care act.
trump has attempted to support his incessant lying about his position on preexisting conditions with phony actions.
i'm concerned about things like college tuition being paid. i don't think we should even consider anything like that. roger leakes, 79 your browser does not support the audio element.
the question now is when that might happen. in december, after the most recent ruling, democratic attorneys defending the affordable care act asked the justices to take the case right away. republicans bringing the lawsuit said it was fine to wait and, last week, the justices said they agreed.
washington (ap) — the supreme court ruled monday that insurance companies can collect $12 billion from the federal government to cover their losses in the early years of the health care law championed by president barack obama.
and if house conservatives are making it a prerequisite that the conference bill eliminate at least some of those regulations that ensure people with pre-existing conditions are charged the same amount as healthy people, they could be setting up the whole process for failure.
but the lawsuit has already prevailed in two lower court cases, both times because republican-appointed judges agreed with its rationale. and without ginsburg, who was sure to uphold the law, the odds of the affordable care act surviving go down.
though trump leads among men in iowa by 21 points, biden leads women by a similar margin, 20 points, according to a recent poll conducted by the des moines register and mediacom iowa.
measured by the magnitude of changes to the tax code, that is true. but in terms of how the bills were developed, deliberated and drafted by congress — not to mention their substance — the bills could not be less alike. and therein lies an illuminating — some would say frightening — story.
democrats were appalled. house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) slammed the action to rip away health care protections in the dead of night and in the middle of a pandemic.
moulton's supposedly nonideological approach is a peculiar one at a time when progressive idealism and opposition to the corrupting influence of money in politics have become increasingly dominant themes in the democratic party.

the tax giveback boosted the net profit for health care service corp. to $4.1 billion on $35.9 billion of revenue, according to its filing, which was first reported by axios. the company reported $1.3 billion in net profit on $32.6 billion of revenue in 2017.
i think there's a number of alternatives and decision points throughout a process like this, and it doesn't have to be all like h.r. 1 or all like other proposals that have been discussed in the past, camp said. obviously, the kinds of assumptions i made in putting together h.r. 1 aren't necessarily the same assumptions you might make today.
we still have a small number of people, and they're still around getting outreach from states.
in other words, those with the greatest need for health care would again face the biggest obstacles to getting it.
still, when it comes to considering costs, some patient advocacy groups get nervous when the subject comes up. i would not be fair if i did not address some of the key questions many patient advocates worry about, perhaps the biggest one being will the consideration of cost mean i lose access to a drug or treatment i need?
democrats do have some advantages in this battle. perhaps chief among them is the accumulating evidence of discord among congressional republicans.

the best way to reduce the number of abortions is to expand access to family planning services, collins said in a statement to huffpost. that's why i have long been a strong supporter of title x family planning, and why i have repeatedly opposed attempts to impose gag orders or burdensome requirements for separate facilities on both clinics in the united states and family planning programs supported by foreign aid.

michael lind, a public policy professor at the university of texas, austin, has written sympathetically about the populist impulses behind trump's candidacy. he compared trump to former president richard nixon, who likewise outsourced management of much of domestic policy to the reigning republican establishment.
fourteen million is a stunning figure because of the reality that uninsured adults in the united states have poor access to health care services and worse health outcomes than insured adults. (this is a real and non-fake fact, repeatedly proven by years of actual research.)
it looked exactly like a republican ad, said an anchorage progressive who asked for anonymity for professional reasons. the progressive, who usually votes for democrats, plans to skip the election this year out of frustration with what they see as the state's democratic candidates' willingness to take the left-wing base for granted.
house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) on wednesday said he's not that concerned about criticism of the wealthy getting a tax cut under the gop's new health care bill.
chaffetz dropped out of the race once ryan got in, but the whole episode illustrated his game of thrones view of politics.
i would of course keep an open mind, she told leahy as he pressed on voting access for black americans.
it's saving for college tuition; it's a utility bill, brady said, according to a post on his website. opponents of this aren't worried about tax cuts for the rich, they're worried about tax cuts for you.
biden is a leading representative of the other side of this debate, which also is appropriate. the white house in which he served carried out the biggest expansion of the health care safety net since democratic president lyndon johnson's great society initiatives, which included the creation of medicare and medicaid.
sponsors of private employer plans, through which roughly half of all americans get insurance, could once again impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, since it's the affordable care act that made such limits illegal. that could really hammer patients with rare forms of cancer or congenital conditions like hemophilia, for which treatments can easily exceed a million dollars per year or sometimes even per month.
broihier called on his backers to support mcgrath in a tuesday afternoon tweet, while booker urged his supporters to maintain their enthusiasm for ousting mcconnell in november.
then there's rep. tom price (r-ga.), trump's choice to be secretary of health and human services, who has his own plan to go along with the president-elect's shifting positions on health care.
moreover, trump ― like other republicans, including house speaker paul ryan (wis.) ― overstates the current difficulties facing the affordable care act's health insurance exchanges.
trump would also revive a plan, rejected by lawmakers in the past, to cut food stamp costs by providing much of the benefit as food shipments instead of cash. he's also proposing work requirements for safety net programs like medicaid, food stamps, and federally subsidized housing.
in 30 states, children in households with incomes up to three times the federal poverty level ― which is about $65,000 a year for a family of three ― can access either chip or medicaid. in 19 states, the upper limit is more than three times poverty, and two states allow only children in families with incomes up to double poverty to enroll.
now is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.

in the primary, voters chose evers over two younger, more progressive options: 41-year-old firefighters' union leader mahlon mitchell once described evers as like my grandfather, and 39-year-old state legislator kelda roys rose concerns evers wouldn't be able to turn out young people. unlike mitchell and roys, evers didn't support the legalization of marijuana, instead asking for a statewide referendum.
these are very basic, simple tasks that come naturally to most leaders but were evidently foreign to trump. and that is something that almost surely resonated with voters, especially when they considered him alongside biden ― who has a record of managing government projects, who made clear his intentions to listen to scientists, and who, as even his critics acknowledge, is famous for his shows of empathy.
voters who supported trump are overwhelmingly aligned in favor of gorsuch: 87 percent think the senate should confirm him, and just 3 percent say that it shouldn't. in contrast, while most clinton voters oppose the nomination, they do so less strongly. fifty-four percent don't want the senate to vote to confirm gorsuch, but 17 percent say that it should, and 29 percent say that they aren't sure.
bernie sanders has proven to be a game changer and taken firm uncompromising positions on these and other major issues of critical importance and in so doing created a sense of optimism and enthusiastic support for real world lasting solutions to these daunting challenges. he has done this rejecting big money politics and by taking a stand that is fundamentally based on a firm sense of morality - without consideration for funding donors or corporate interests. in other words, a much needed breath of fresh air. the sanders campaign has engaged millions of passionate americans in the political process and expanded the liberal base substantially. if hillary clinton does eventually become the democratic nominee as is likely, she will need the support of bernie sanders supporters to defeat donald trump. it is imperative that the democratic party now move towards a truly neutral position as the primary process is completed or risk further alienating senator sanders base and consequently increasing the possibility of a trump presidency, surely the worst of all possible outcomes.
partly out of frugality and partly out of disappointment with the actual experience of the plan that i had, and partly because ― and i know this is sort of taking a risk — but i'm so healthy right now, kenny said.

sonia sloan, 88, has been a first state democratic activist all her life and said she hasn't seen this much excitement in a race since eugene mccarthy, whose presidential bid she chaired in delaware in 1968. this year, she's co-hosting a fundraiser for the democrat in the race, environmental attorney stephanie hansen.
gross' case that sullivan is not prioritizing alaska rests more than anything on the junior senator's repeated votes to repeal the affordable care act, including a vote for a bill that very nearly passed in july 2017.
coffman claimed in a statement to nbc 9 that he was limited by his reservation at the library.
much of the forum also focused on democratic voters' top issue so far in the campaign: health care. moderate candidates like bullock continued making their argument for incremental change by improving obamacare and making insurance and prescription drugs more affordable. more progressive candidates like sanders attacked private insurers and pressed the case for ambitious reform through medicare for all.
swinton, who grew up in columbia and is majoring in sports management, said she is also concerned about women's reproductive rights, gun control, climate change and funding for historically black colleges and universities. she has been watching the campaigns closely, especially their outreach in her home state. that warren and sanders have chosen black women as south carolina state directors who are actually from the palmetto state shows a good faith effort to appeal to voters in the area.
from a political perspective, the move was confounding. polls show that the majority of the public approves of the law, in large part because of popular provisions like the pre-existing conditions mandate. and democrats have the upper hand on the issue.
so, i made the painful decision to drop out of my ph.d. program. this was a very personal blow ― the last time i had quit anything was the girl scouts when i was 7. but it was necessary; i needed good insurance and the only way i could see obtaining that was to finish my m.d. training as quickly as possible and start my medical residency, a low-paying job but one that comes with health insurance.
the trump administration still isn't done. right now it's supporting a lawsuit challenging the affordable care act's constitutionality. it's a bonkers case that virtually nobody in the legal establishment takes seriously. but the republican state officials who first brought the lawsuit have asked the courts to throw out the entire law and the trump administration has endorsed that recommendation.
other provisions: the bill makes a number of changes to insurance regulations, including aiming at allowing individuals with continuous coverage to avoid being medically underwritten (re-risk rated) in the small group market. it also allows for states to make determinations as to what constitute essential health benefits and allows for 5-to-1 ration of premiums for older individuals compared to younger individuals.
despite the tough talk, trump's actions on the ground in florida underscored the conflicting messages his administration has sent throughout the pandemic. all the president's security personnel and support staff were wearing face masks when air force one touched down, but trump and florida's republican gov. ron desantis were barefaced. crowds gathered at the president's subsequent events, many without masks as well.
in sending the ruling back to o'connor, the 5th circuit judges did not offer much in the way of new guidance, so it is unclear just how differently o'connor would rule this time.
i am not getting rid of the filibuster until somebody can demonstrate to me how we can protect the folks who ― if we had gotten rid of the filibuster right now, 28 million people in this country would not have gotten health care, harrison told huffpost, referring to the gop's repeated failed attempts to eliminate obamacare. i'm tired of the lies. i'm tired of lindsey graham not telling the truth.
the urban institute, which is nonpartisan but generally center-left, has modeled plans similar to biden's. overall, blumberg said, about 10% of people with employer-sponsored coverage would end up with subsidized exchange coverage instead. and mostly it would be low-income workers choosing to do it on their own, not employers dropping insurance.
and if you didn't think chaffetz saw this as a minor issue that the gsa, not trump, needed to resolve, he also said there was probably an easy, simple remedy.
the blue cross blue shield association, a chicago-based entity that licenses the blue brand to insurers that covered 8.6 million people in the individual health insurance market as of dec. 31, reviewed those companies' claims data from 2014 and 2015 to conclude something is different about the new entrants to the insurance system.
moore also said fewer companies would offer job-based insurance and, after the law took full effect, that the data proved it was happening. employers are also dropping their health coverage and dumping employees and their families on medicaid and the obamacare exchanges, he wrote in 2015.
how ministries became part of the health care landscape
donnelly is often seen as an accidental senator. he won his seat in 2012 after his opponent, then–state treasurer richard mourdock, said pregnancies from rape were a gift from god. that gaffe and others enabled donnelly to cobble together 50 percent of the vote, winning over working-class voters and suburban women — the same coalition he needs to win a second term.
biden's statement on barrett's nomination on saturday was almost entirely devoted to health care and noted that the nominee has a written track record of disagreeing with the u.s. supreme court's decision upholding the affordable care act.
he added that members also feel secure knowing their money isn't going to a medical procedure to which they are opposed.

it is difficult to see how a large federal spending package would make it to the president's desk. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), chao's husband, has warned against trying to pass a trillion-dollar stimulus through a republican-controlled congress. a small group of conservatives in the house known as the freedom caucus has already flexed its muscles by helping derail legislation that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act.
which brings me to leslie jones, who i happen to adore.
trump could help chaffetz by reversing obama's decision — and win a favor down the road. there's nothing necessarily wrong with a member of congress advocating for the interests of his state. but trump's transactional view of the world might present problems for the lawmakers who are supposed to keep him in check. and it's just remarkable to see a relationship developing between trump and chaffetz, given where they were a few months ago.
adler, who was an architect of yet another previous challenge to the affordable care act, went on to say that her views on the case may ultimately reflect her sensibility of how a judge should act more than her political philosophy.

under the medicaid expansion, states can use extra federal funds to open up their programs to all residents with incomes below or just above the poverty line, instead of limiting eligibility to targeted groups ― such as young children and pregnant women ― as they have done in the past. more than two-thirds of the states have taken advantage of the opportunity, as michigan officials agreed to do in 2014.
in terms of a legislative record to run on, republicans are unlikely to have much to add to the tax cuts from december. mcconnell has already said he's not inclined to make another run at obamacare. the two issues most mentioned as congressional agenda items are infrastructure spending and immigration – neither of which appears terribly likely to pass at this moment.

when huffpost asked republicans about their record on pre-existing conditions on thursday, house lawmakers generally acted like the bill they'd passed in may 2016 was one that wouldn't have affected coverage for sick people.
but democrats and republicans are now both emphasizing his skill and importance. (the portrait of mcconnell as master manipulator and strategist ignores the aforementioned failure to repeal obamacare, as well as his occasional electoral missteps.)

outgoing gov. rick snyder has endorsed calley, but that may not be enough, as schuette regularly reminds voters he received the president's endorsement. schuette is currently leading polls.
the farm bureau plans would also be outside the jurisdiction of the state's department of insurance. customers looking to challenge treatment denials or make other complaints would have to appeal to the state attorney general's office, rather than the agency who have expertise in handling the insurance industry.
here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
they are literally teeing this up as an issue for democrats for the next year and a half. they're not even making a laughable attempt to save the most popular parts of the affordable care act, sen. chris murphy (d-conn.) told reporters on tuesday.
sarah huckabee sanders, another successful working mother who has not been on the side of gender equality, tweeted last week, if liberals actually cared about empowering women, they'd be applauding judge amy coney barrett - a working mom with impeccable legal credentials.
solicitor general noel francisco argued the entire aca thus must fall because congress invalidated the individual coverage mandate in 2017.
a year or so ago trump seemed like a charming buffoon that no one took seriously. but now he has lead his confederacy of donces to the well of do anything, say anything you want and america is now on fire.

barrett has been a federal appeals court judge since 2017 and was previously a legal scholar at the university of notre dame in indiana.
it's about a command that isn't actually a command
as obama noted to lawmakers wednesday, the american public isn't enthusiastic about repealing the affordable care act, despite the fact that more people disapprove of the law than approve of it. a henry j. kaiser family foundation survey conducted after the election found that nearly half of americans want to keep obamacare as-is or even expand it, compared to about one-quarter who want it fully repealed.
whenever a ruling does come, it has the potential to invalidate the affordable care act and wreak havoc on the u.s. health care system.
the psychology major saw voter disenfranchisement play out in her first year at benedict. the state's law requires people to present a south carolina or federal photo id to vote, which could be a barrier for students who aren't residents.
none of this has been popular with voters, which is why trump is trying desperately to make them forget that record. preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100% by republicans and the republican party, he said just a few days ago.
to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal. and last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.
and another republican, brian fitzpatrick (r-pa.), also told huffpost he would support extraordinary measures to stop the spread of the virus. i mean, this is a crisis right now, so we got to respond in any way that's going to fix the problem, he said.
but these experiments, some of which the trump administration endorsed, were carried out through the center for medicare and medicaid innovation, which the affordable care act authorizes and finances. shutting down the law would mean shutting down the center and its programs, with unknown consequences for the health care providers participating in them.

the second ad, the minute-long show up, features audio of former president barack obama discussing how young voters failed to show up at the polls in 2014, while a young man performs an interpretive dance.
discussions are also taking place in congress, where some democrats have proposed opening up medicaid to more people, others are talking about doing the same for medicare and a third of the democratic caucus endorsed the latest proposal from sanders ― which would actually eliminate private insurance altogether and give everybody a more generous version of medicare.
that effort failed in the face of industry opposition and nearly every state with a system for setting hospital rates eventually ditched it, as regulation fell out of fashion among the nation's most influential politicians and intellectuals. but after watching the private sector try and fail to control hospital prices for the better part of 50 years, even some economists who once dismissed the idea of government price controls are saying the idea deserves more serious consideration.
the released text includes advanceable, refundable tax credits that would be available to individuals who do not otherwise have access to health insurance provided to them, such as through employer-sponsored coverage, medicare, etc. these credits would be set at levels above those called for in sec. tom price's previous bills, which was the basis for the disturbingly high-cost scores we have referenced in the past. specifically, the draft provides a credit of: $2,000 for those under 30, $2,500 for those 30-40, $3,000 for those 40-50, $3500 for those 50-60, and $4,000 for those over 60. the bill phases out these credits for individuals earning more than $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers), by reducing the credit by 10% of the amount by which an individual's income exceeds the threshold.
the columbia, south carolina, native is convinced that sanders is the best pick for the next president because he is running an uncorrupted campaign that will be responsible to the people instead of corporations, he said. and nothing makes that more clear, washington said, than his commitment to making sure people can get the medical care they need without going bankrupt.
democrats have spent more than republicans on obamacare ads this cycle, a major shift from every other election since the health care law passed.
most recently, the former obama administration medicare and medicaid chief served as de facto point man in the public and private fight to protect the aca from republican repeal efforts.
the vote to limit debate on barrett's nomination was 51-48, with all democrats opposed. gop sens. susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska also voted not to advance the nomination, citing the upcoming election.
and why are the plans exempt? simply because the legislature said so. iowa got the idea from tennessee, where the state has been allowing the sale of similar plans since the 1990s, and now kansas gop leaders are hoping to do the same thing. just this past week, the state's senate passed legislation to allow farm bureau plans, despite warnings that the plans would expose unwitting consumers to big medical costs.
sen. kamala harris asked kavanaugh directly if he had a conversation about special counsel robert muller's russia investigation with anyone working at the law firm founded by president donald trump's lawyer marc kasowitz.
once you get knocked out of the workforce, it's hard to get back on track. so ginsburg hung on.
trump said his new administration will present its ideas about health care reform after rep. tom price (r-ga.) is confirmed as secretary of the department of health and human services.
it's more important than ever that democrats win at least one chamber of congress in november and put the brakes on trump's agenda.

prior to his presidential run, carson rose to prominence as director of pediatric surgery at johns hopkins university. he was also the recipient of the presidential medal of freedom in 2008 and is the author of several widely read books.
rather than forming a state-run health system, the federal government offered companies incentives to provide health insurance to their employees through a series of tax measures in the 1940s and 1950s. with those incentives and a booming post-world war ii economy, employers found that offering health insurance to their employees was one of the best ways they could recruit and retain workers in a scarce labor market.
many consumers will buy these plans thinking they are getting a great deal. but ... these plans cover very little. sabrina corlette, georgetown center for health insurance reforms
texas democratic party spokesman abhi rahman praised cornyn for finally supporting the affordable care act and welcomed him to join the party's efforts to protect the law from people trying to overturn it in court. texas attorney general ken paxton is currently leading a coalition of 20 republican states challenging the aca before the supreme court.
aetna executives backed up those arguments by citing poor financial performance as a reason for its withdrawals.
in south carolina's heavily republican 5th district, democrat archie parnell, a 66-year-old tax attorney, battles republican ralph norman, a 63-year-old former state representative, for control of the seat vacated by white house budget director mick mulvaney.
it wasn't supposed to be this way, at least not exactly. the idea of the aca was to make sure all americans, in all states, could get health insurance, partly by creating new, subsidized market of regulated private plans and partly by offering medicaid to all americans living below or just above the poverty line.
the argument made clear the plaintiffs' attempt to upend the aca will fail, said jonathan adler, a case western university law professor who supported previous challenges to the affordable care act. the only question is 'how.' there seemed to be five solid votes for severability of the mandate as both the chief justice and justice kavanaugh expressed profound skepticism of plaintiffs' claims here.
rep. gerry connolly (d-va.), who is still considering whether to support an impeachment inquiry, said mueller just explaining his findings on camera may make impeachment more popular.
on monday, the justice department filed a note with the court saying that it now intends to side with the plaintiffs fully because it agrees with the district judge. in other words, the administration now believes the entire law should go.
in turn, sanders released a statement over the weekend saying he hoped his fellow democrats would not resort to misinformation about my legislation. sanders plans to give a speech in d.c. this week that will directly confront the democratic opponents of medicare for all.
notably, that meant the ministries could continue to limit or exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions, and decline to include some of the law's essential benefits.
former gov. bill walker, an ex-republican, won as an independent in 2014 ― the same year that sullivan unseated begich. alyse galvin, who nearly unseated rep. don young in 2018 ― and is trying again in november ― also identifies as an independent.
many studies tout the benefits of family leave for parents and children alike. children whose parents are granted paid parental leave are more likely to be immunized. women are also more likely to breastfeed longer if given more paid time off, which in turn can help prevent asthma, infections and other health problems. a 2011 study found that increasing paid maternity and paternity leave could even reduce the infant mortality rate by 10 percent. fathers who are given paternity leave are more likely to take an active role in parenting later on, which can help with children's development.
ontheissues.org reported that in 2011 trump changed his stance on abortion, the once 'pro-choice' individual switches to 'pro-life'. then 10 months later says it should be defunded.
democratic candidates in the midwest are pushing back on donald trump's chaos with competence, democratic governors' association spokesman jared leopold said. voters want steady leaders who'll get things done and fight back against wrong-headed policies from d.c.
over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military ― with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. for years, the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato ― but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies.
· millions of children in low-income families would have to make do without adequate medical services, hurting their quality of life and the quality of their education. for example, children with conditions such as unmanaged asthma and chronic allergies would miss school and find it difficult to concentrate when they are in attendance, compromising their school performance and limiting their educational and economic prospects.
to be clear: republicans are not even pretending they will work with democrats if they lose the presidency. mcconnell, who is running for reelection in 2020, recently promised voters in kentucky he would be the grim reaper for progressive proposals.
will states choose to spend on nursing homes, or things like doctor care for young children? asked jack kahn, a veteran retirement health-care reporter and contributing editor of the franklin prosperity report. old and young are the country's biggest consumers of health care.
so how does it all add up? trumpcare would cover far fewer people than obamacare, take away not only the consumer protections that law provides but undermine strong insurance regulations in states that have them, force an unknown number of people off medicaid, and let wealthy people save money on health insurance and reduce their tax burdens.
curbing reproductive rights. protected by roe v. wade and our own privilege, it is easy for us to ignore what the gop is doing beyond our field of vision -- our daughters, after all, have access to safe and legal abortion and any form of birth control they need. but this is not so in america at large, where republican legislatures and the congress are working overtime to limit access to abortion and reproductive care, often at great cost to women and their families.
california has a long record of using government to help people get health care.
leah millis/reuters president donald trump has taken multiple steps that have undermined the affordable care act's newly reformed insurance markets.
republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases like the 116% hike in arizona, trump tweeted.
inslee then patiently explained that her claims were not accurate.
the ad offers a laundry list of attacks against him, from his efforts to dismantle obamacare and his push for sweeping corporate tax cuts to the administration's child separation immigration policy and slow response to the coronavirus pandemic. it also assails trump's comments about the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in charlottesville, virginia, and his reactions to the recent demonstrations against police brutality.
the campaign did not explicitly address though why sullivan voted for the repeal bill, particularly one that would have defunded medicaid expansion and freed states from federal rules protecting people with preexisting conditions from being charged more for coverage. sullivan ran on improving the affordable care act and i think he stood by his word, shuckerow said.
republicans are divided ― and increasingly isolated
that is why this is, without question, an american tragedy, the presidency of trump, the leadership of both him and his vice president, mike pence, and what all of this has wrought.
such an outcome would mean preserving some pretty big elements of the existing health insurance system, starting with the presence of for-profit insurers. that is no small matter. but this kind of policy evolution is typical, according to jacob hacker, a yale political scientist who has written extensively on the history of social programs and worked with delauro and schakowsky on their bill.
obamacare is failing millions of americans. sen. heller supports delivering more access, better benefits, and lower costs to nevadans, said heller spokesman neal patel. this bill is a little over two days old. it's still working its way through the house. the senator will be monitoring it closely. ‎he will continue to work with the governor to advocate for nevadans who depend on medicaid, while also tackling the problems caused by obamacare.
that would be a less dramatic cut for hospitals than what the aggressive versions of sanders and jayapal would impose. but the insurance benefit under medicare for america would also be less generous, with out-of-pocket costs for people with incomes above twice the poverty line. the sanders and jayapal bills would eliminate out-of-pocket costs altogether, except for token cost-sharing on some prescription drugs.
and in the summer of 2018, the administration decided to back this latest lawsuit against the affordable care act. that was a highly unusual move, because by tradition the executive branch defends federal statutes in court — even those the president might oppose.
some republicans are worried that his embrace of trump — braun called himself a humbler version of the new york real estate magnate and ran ads promising to build trump's promised border wall and follow the president's agenda — could alienate voters in the suburbs. trump won just 56 percent of the vote in hamilton county, a gop stronghold where george w. bush claimed nearly three-quarters of the vote in his two presidential bids.

kavanaugh continually refuses to answer questions on roe v. wade, but sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) asked whether the judge can think of any laws that allow the government to make a decision about a man's body.
the new paper doesn't explain why this is happening. but the answer is no great mystery.
donnelly has a low profile in d.c. compared with some of the other democratic senators facing re-election in 2018 — missouri sen. claire mccaskill is ubiquitous on cable news, for instance, and montana sen. jon tester played a key role in spiking the nomination of trump's white house doctor to lead the department of veterans affairs. but donnelly is a constant presence back home, and he has already gone on multiple tours of the state, driving a campaign-branded recreational vehicle.

he's also made very specific promises to protect people with preexisting conditions, and last month he actually issued an executive order that would supposedly make that promise a policy reality.

here, too, there's no reason to think this position hurt trump with his base. on the contrary, polling late in the cycle showed that the vast majority of republicans thought trump would actually do a better job than biden of protecting people with preexisting conditions.
it was a tough look for dimon and another turn in the limelight for porter, who has now embarrassed three financial executives at congressional hearings in as many months. but her exchange with dimon was also a curious new installment in a different capitol hill drama ― the ongoing tension between house democratic leadership and their all-star freshman class.
some of them that are at least indicating to y'all that they're going to vote no are going to vote yes, rep. bradley byrne (r-ala.) told reporters outside of ryan's offices, arguing that the longer past midnight thursday the vote goes, the less likely it will succeed.
and this is who just yesterday called hillary clinton a bigot.
we live in the richest country in history, and yet we do not guarantee this most basic human right, barkan said. everyone living in america should get the health care they need regardless of their employment status or ability to pay.
a: there's lots of evidence that health care prices are higher than they need to be. but that applies to the entire industry, including doctors and hospitals. and cutting revenue to any of these sectors too dramatically, indiscriminately or quickly carries its own risks. you could reduce incentives for the development of new treatments, force the shuttering of struggling but vital hospitals, and so on.

in 2018, judge reed o'connor, a republican appointee, ruled in favor of the lawsuit. last year, two republican appointees on a three-judge panel at the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals agreed with the arguments about the mandate, but sent the case back to o'connor with instructions to sift through the statute and decide whether at least some parts can remain.

the ruling from the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit in new orleans upheld key elements of a controversial, widely criticized decision that a district court handed down last year. the lower court had held that a gop-controlled congress rendered the entire statute unconstitutional in 2017 when it eliminated the affordable care act's tax penalty for people who violated the law's individual mandate to have health coverage.
the public plan option raised in the president's article is really just a single payer system. the plan was mentioned deep in the article and stated that congress should consider it for those facing limited insurance market competition. as insurance companies bail out of this market, more people could become eligible for this option. maybe that's what the president wanted all along. socialized medicine has been tried in other countries; it usually results in a two tiered system. those who can afford to pay will be able to get timely and high quality care. those who cannot afford to pay will be put on a waiting list and the care provided will be regulated by the government. i cannot be convinced that the government will be better at taking care of my patients than i am.
whatever the reason, the unsubstantiated boasts, combined with daily falsehoods large and small, have undermined not just his own credibility, but that of the party he now leads.
many democrats do not support medicare for all. but at this point even democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, medicare or medicaid, to more people.
the state party is hosting a candidate training in march. when officials opened up registration, they sold out 50 tickets in the first day. a week later, the party expanded it to 200 spots ― and again immediately sold out.
some suggested regulating prices only in markets where hospitals have monopolies. others echoed the sentiments of hilary haycock, president of harbage consulting, a california-based firm that works with hospitals and other providers of medical care. she thinks price regulations could work if hospitals had enough time to adjust, suggesting that more of a 10-year horizon is reasonable.
lipinski sought to depict newman as too radical for the district. he ran ads saying she wanted to repeal obamacare and strip health care from constituents because of her support for medicare for all.
bollier has raised five times more money than marshall in october, and the polls show the two candidates either tied or with marshall only a few points ahead. kansas went for trump by 21 points in 2016, but now biden is less than 10 percentage points behind him in the polls.
mekelburg's islamophobia also put siino in an awkward position. in february 2017, after his startup went out of business following a trademark dispute, siino found a new job with the wwe, the connecticut-based pro wrestling entertainment company co-founded by linda mcmahon, who now works in the trump administration. siino, who did not respond to huffpost's requests for comment, became a senior vice president responsible for global content distribution and business development. mekelburg told galasso that the wwe knew about @amymek and had asked siino to keep his connection to his wife quiet.
it worked out that way in states like california and michigan, but not in states like north carolina and tennessee ― states where insurers over the last few years have jacked up premiums or dropped out of the markets altogether because they were losing so much money. in many of those same states, millions of low-income people remained uninsured, because officials have not made medicaid available to them.
washington (reuters) - the white house planned a monday night celebration of the republican senate's expected confirmation of amy coney barrett to the u.s. supreme court, a month after a similar event was linked to a covid-19 outbreak that preceded president donald trump's own infection.
that might not necessarily be what republicans have in mind, however, should their obamacare repeal efforts fail. they might prefer to sabotage the law as much as they can, then try to blame democrats for its failure, as democrats say the gop is already doing.
more frightening is that trump and his gop enablers are just as determined to retain all levers of power in november. and they will do whatever it takes to make sure that happens.
house democrats propose eliminating the cutoff at 400 percent of the poverty level and providing sufficient financial assistance to limit all exchange customers' premiums to 8.5 percent of their annual incomes, based on the cost of a mid-level silver insurance policy. the measure also would increase the subsidies provided to those with incomes up to 300 percent of the poverty level, or about $36,000 for a single person and $75,000 for a family of four.
michigan is a lot more like california than arizona. in fact, it's a case study in how the law works when favorable conditions exist. and better still, it offers hints as to what those conditions are.
the debate over medicare for all was one of the defining fights of the 2020 democratic primaries, pitting champions like sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) against skeptics like biden. at times, biden even likened medicare for all to repeal of the affordable care act.
trump's views on gun control are listed clearly on his campaign site the second amendment to our constitution is clear. the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon. period.
mcgrath and gray hardly differed on the issues. they opposed barr's votes to repeal the affordable care act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of the district's residents, and both supported expanding the law instead. they were largely aligned on other issues, including support for minimum wage increases and opposition to the sweeping republican tax cut package that barr supported in 2017.
democrats opposed tillis' bill, dismissing it as a show vote designed by mcconnell to protect republicans facing reelection.
hanauer pointed to findings from the survey that suggest voters will give heller even less love if he helps carry out the repeal bid, especially if the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, is replaced by the proposal currently moving through the house of representatives.

the legislation that was to be put to a vote thursday was said to be a take-it-or-leave-it, final offer from the white house. it contained clear conservative wins, including the elimination of essential benefits such as maternity care and mental illness treatment. it also was meant to appease those centrist republicans concerned too many people will be tossed from the health insurance rolls, by keeping a 0.9 percent medicare surcharge tax from the affordable care act on high-income earners for six years. that would add about $15 billion to a fund to help states defray costs.
the politics may be harder than the policy
the district judge, republican appointee reed o'connor, endorsed this argument. two circuit court judges, both of them also republican appointees, agreed with him about the mandate's constitutionality. (a third judge, a democratic appointee, dissented.)
as an architect of the gop's budget blueprints, its vice presidential nominee in 2012 and the leader of the house's majority caucus since 2015, ryan has laid out a detailed, sweeping agenda of lower taxes and government spending. if ever fully enacted, it would arguably amount to the most radical domestic policy overhaul since the mid-1960s.

an estimated 78,000 uninsured people would be eligible for health coverage if idaho, one of the 18 states that hasn't opted into the medicaid expansion, accepted federal dollars available through the affordable care act to participate.
president trump is lying to you about his executive order.
most of the republican schemes under consideration, including a working draft of house legislation that politico obtained last week, envision the federal government continuing to provide assistance to people who buy coverage on their own. but the assistance would take a different form ― with a new formula for the tax credits, and no special assistance for out-of-pocket costs.
we already have too many citizens no longer able to derive meaning or financial stability from any employment they can find and/or hold. this has fueled crime, addiction, and a hollowing out of the american life. people focused on survival and a search for hope aren't focused on training for the remaining jobs we still have.
#7: delegate more power (and trust) to the people.
medicare for america's cost control mechanism might not be as aggressive as what the sanders bill or its leading house counterpart, a bill from rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), would impose. (sanders and jayapal haven't been as specific about payment levels, so it's difficult to be sure.) but it would still mean the government directly influencing prices, as it does in pretty much every other country.
the trump administration was criticized last year for scheduling almost-weekly maintenance of the healthcare.gov site during the obamacare enrollment period.
i actually don't think the courts are eventually ever going to strike it down, sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) said wednesday. he called the case, which was argued before an appeals court in new orleans on tuesday, pretty far-fetched.
to republicans in california, the new mandate and the effort to prop up the affordable care act more generally make no sense. we're putting gum and macgyvering band-aids on this system, andreas borgeas, a republican state senator, said in march. it needs to be redone and reviewed top to bottom.
in june, we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d. eisenhower called the great crusade ― the allied liberation of europe in world war ii. on d-day, june 6, 1944, 15,000 young american men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. here with us tonight are three of those heroes: private first class joseph reilly, staff sergeant irving locker, and sergeant herman zeitchik. gentlemen, we salute you.
conservatives are begging the federal courts to uphold obamacare.
rosendale, like the others, has been a vocal advocate for obamacare repeal.
has the most restrictive eligibility guidelines for patient financial assistance of any major hospital system in virginia. savings of only $4,000 in a retirement account can disqualify a family from aid, even if its income is barely above the poverty level.
the most vivid example of this is a regulation the trump administration formally proposed last week. it would allow insurers to sell short-term or limited duration plans that would last for up to one year. such plans can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and don't have to cover all of the essential benefits, engaging in the sorts of practices that the 2010 health care law sought to prohibit altogether.
unlike the double bill of democratic debates in detroit earlier this week, the las vegas forum didn't include face-to-face attacks between moderates and progressives. instead, there was a lot of agreement among the field ― in particular, that the next democratic president needs to help rebuild organized labor, with the union membership rate in the u.s. now hovering near a historic low of just 10.5%.

enacting these would be difficult, as even the fiercest proponents of these schemes understand. one potential benefit of the incremental reforms newsom and his allies are about to pass in california is that they could build credibility with the voters, making those bigger changes more achievable in the future. another advantage is that they could provide assistance to people who need it ― and can't afford to wait.
but wait! let's break this down. the trump organization, like virtually all large employers in the u.s., provides health benefits to its full-time employees, so there's no way all the people who work there are having problems with obamacare.
health care keeps coming up in the approach to the 2018 midterms. and republicans keep deceiving the public about it, because they are desperate to show that they didn't try to strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions when, in fact, they did.
the open enrollment period for exchange customers last november and december was the first over which the trump team had total control. they took advantage.
virginia has never had a female governor. but virginia was the first state to elect a black man as governor, so many are hoping that it follows up and elects the first black woman as well. (democrat douglas wilder, who served 1990-1994, remains the only black person elected to the job in the state.)

kaiser family foundation a map demonstrating the house bill's effect on tax credits to buy health insurance for 60-year-old americans earning $30,000 annually.
the law's tax credit subsidies were supposed to offset the higher prices, and millions got comprehensive insurance because of them. but the subsidies tapered off as income rose and cut out altogether at four times the poverty line, which today is about $100,000 a year for a family of four.
and just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. last year, i heard through friends the story of alice johnson. i was deeply moved. in 1997, alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. she had a big impact on that prison population ― and far beyond.
when president donald trump last year signed into law the biggest tax overhaul in three decades, many experts concluded it was clear that most of the cuts went to the wealthy. less clear was that the cuts disproportionately favor whites over minorities — a gulf that will likely worsen a centuries-old economic divide between the races.

the annual open enrollment period for the health insurance exchange marketplaces the affordable care act created aren't until fall, but the law allows people to sign up and apply for subsidies whenever they experience a qualifying life event. losing your job-based health benefits is one of those events.
throughout, macarthur defended the so-called american health care act over boos and jeers from constituents, many of whom charged that the congressman would have blood on his hands if the bill becomes law. several times during the event, macarthur struggled to retain control of the room, getting shouted down even as he told the story of the 1996 death of his 11-year-old daughter, who was born with special needs.

barrett drew a distinction between the new case and prior supreme court rulings upholding the law ― which she has criticized ― because the issue at hand involves analyzing whether a portion of the law is so central to its purpose that the entire rest of the law must fall. the gop lawsuit argues it is; most legal experts say it is not.

the cdc's alarming estimate bolsters public health experts' calls to increase u.s. testing capabilities to combat the virus. however, president donald trump has argued for less testing over the last week, on the basis that accurate statistics paint his administration's response in a negative light. the u.s. reportedly has conducted more than 30 million tests since the crisis began.

among the proposals now under discussion include tying the price of u.s. drugs to what other governments pay, or simply having the u.s. government negotiate directly with drugmakers over prices ― with the possibility, perhaps, of using march-in rights to break patent protections when drugmakers demand high prices for pharmaceuticals developed with federal funding.
calling a supreme court decision settled law means nothing, because the court can overturn previous decisions. senate minority leader chuck schumer (n.y.) asked kavanaugh a more meaningful question ― whether roe was wrongly decided ― and kavanaugh would not answer, despite having weighed in on other decisions. that he agrees with roberts on the matter should be another major red flag: since calling roe settled law, roberts has voted against abortion rights nearly every time the issue has come before him.
returning flexibility to insurance companies will not only allow them to raise rates, but also restore to them a catalogue of reasons to refuse to pay the claims of those who can afford to buy a policy. the unregulated market will also enable companies to invent procedural hoops for claimants, any one of which can derail a claim. rather than moving towards reducing the administrative burden on health providers, trumpcare appears headed to create a market in which providers and insurance companies vie to maximize their income by squeezing the consumer.

but just this week, the commonwealth fund and the urban institute released a new report about health care options and concluded that, in a plan that looks like medicare for all, higher-income people will likely face the greatest increases in taxes, meaning their new tax burdens would likely exceed their savings; the reverse is likely true for lower-income populations.

great leaders always remind us that commitment to great principles wins in the end. they point out ways in which we can contribute, uniting us around a common vision. they reassure us that our work is not in vain. they take away our frustration and give us catharsis and direction in return. they keep us from indulging our worst selves.
klobuchar questioned a past dissent of kavanaugh's by seeming to suggest it could threaten vital government agencies, repeatedly naming the social security administration as an example. in his dissent, kavanaugh wrote that the consumer financial protection bureau is an unconstitutional body because it's led by just one member. klobuchar said other agencies are structured similarly, but kavanaugh did not explain what the difference was.
insurance lobby organizations america's health insurance plans and the blue cross blue shield association urged lawmakers in a letter thursday to include insurance plan subsidies in upcoming coronavirus stimulus packages. it also encouraged a one-time special enrollment period for the individual market — regardless of an individual's current health status or whether they have coverage today.

on friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone ― almost double what was expected. an economic miracle is taking place in the united states ― and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
most democrats, however, are skeptical that funding vehicles of this sort, known as public-private partnerships, will be enough. in interviews with the huffington post on thursday, several senate democrats said they would be willing to work with trump if his plan includes real federal spending.
the most ambitious of the schemes circulating now are the single-payer proposals. they include all of the elements democrats are discussing: more generous financial assistance, federally administered insurance and government-set prices. if fully implemented, they would create a health care system that strongly resembles some of the universal systems abroad.
the administration could decide to appeal the bates decision. if it does, the case could end up in the hands of the supreme court and its five-member conservative majority. but bates is also a relatively conservative judge. a republican president, george w. bush, put him on the bench.
this would leave states on the hook for any costs above that amount, which would be smaller than federal funding today. that would likely lead states to remove people from the rolls, trim benefits and/or cut payment rates to medical providers, reducing coverage and access to care.
sanders' team believes the rallies, often held alongside democratic senators and house members from those states, helped stiffen the party's spines during the fight over repeal. obamacare, which was already growing in popularity, soon become untouchable, and the party refused to compromise with gop repeal attempts.
just how big a difference this regulation would ultimately make is difficult to say. in a fact sheet accompanying the proposed regulations, hhs said that for 2019 it expects 100,000 to 200,000 people to drop traditional coverage and buy short-term policies instead. that is not a huge number.
moreover, segmenting the health insurance market between the healthy and the sick undermines the entire notion of insurance. changing the rules to let insurers sell one set of policies to healthy people and another to those with pre-existing conditions and ongoing health care needs inevitably leads to the latter policies becoming costlier. and that's not just a problem for those who are currently sick because everyone gets sick eventually, be it today or decades from now.

we don't have to talk about this unbelievable victory — wasn't it unbelievable? so we don't have to say it again. but it's going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the senate, trump boasted, standing in front of beaming house members.
to me, all of these questions stem from the fact that hillary supporters assume that they and bernie supporters are fundamentally on the same team. while bernie and hillary fans may be rooting for different candidates now, both sides are democrats with the same goal of beating the republicans, right? doesn't the fundamental rule of the enemy of my enemy is my friend still apply?
in addition to the tax credits the affordable care act offers to low- and middle-income households to reduce their monthly health insurance premiums, the law provides extra subsidies to the poorest enrollees that cut their out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments.
the trump memo is a chilling, ominous blueprint for totalitarian constitution burning. https://t.co/chqxkbpm5j — richard blumenthal (@senblumenthal) june 3, 2018
every republican and most democrats in congress publicly oppose medicare for all. and while those numbers have certainly been shifting, there is almost certainly a critical mass of democrats who would join republicans to block a single-payer health care system in the house ― let alone the senate, where republicans are likely to retain the majority, or at least be a vote or two away from it.
biden was never very smart, trump told the room, according to the times. he was a terrible student. his gaffes are unbelievable. when i say something that you might think is a gaffe, it's on purpose; it's not a gaffe. when biden says something dumb, it's because he's dumb.
republicans can certainly patch up the exchanges and keep them going during a transition period. all it would require is halting their relentless efforts to blow up the law and start trying to make it work. (they want to pump money back in to the insurers without appearing like they're giving them a handout or bailing them out, one insurance lobbyist explains.) but if they do this, then they'll have essentially proven that they can fix obamacare. and if they can fix it, why would they let it expire? especially when the deadline for the replacement approaches and, inevitably, republicans have still failed to produce a replacement?
planned parenthood: the bill defunds planned parenthood for one year.
of course, it's not clear how much the trump administration cares about what happens to the people who lose medicaid ― or whether it cares at all. among the first states to get the administration's go-ahead for work requirements, not a single one of them had created systems for checking whether people losing coverage end up in better jobs or with better health, according to an investigation that the los angeles times published this week.
praeger is among those who would prefer to see kansas lawmakers find solutions that help all customers, not just those presently in good health. one possibility would be to start a reinsurance program that, in effect, would reimburse insurers for the high-cost customers that drive up premiums.
democrats insisted they weren't caving, even though they didn't get what they wanted: an immediate vote on protections for undocumented young people often called dreamers. but the deal gave them a way out of what could have been a politically damaging shutdown. the promise of a vote on the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, although it could be reneged on, is something democrats didn't have before. it's the first time democrats received a firm deadline for a vote on an immigration bill. and if mcconnell doesn't follow through, democrats will be able to use this promise to vote against the next spending bill and pin the blame on republicans.
in fact, the new legislation looks a lot like earlier versions of the measure that politico, the wall street journal, and other publications have described. studies of those bills suggested they would result in cheaper premiums for younger and healthier people, and new tax breaks for more affluent consumers ― but also higher out-of-pocket costs, higher premiums for older and sicker people, and ultimately many more uninsured.
large businesses like the trump organization don't use obamacare. businesses buy health insurance for large numbers of people from commercial insurance carriers (or businesses contract with those providers to administer benefits but pay workers' medical bills with company money).
trashing the president (note: only if the president is from a different party)
o'connor's original ruling endorsed the argument of the plaintiffs: that the courts must respect the will of congress. but ― as critics of his decision pointed out ― whether or not congress in 2010 really thought the mandate was essential, by 2017 congress had quite obviously decided otherwise, because it reduced the penalty to zero fully aware that the rest of the affordable care act would continue to operate.
it took too long to get it right, biden conceded. i'll be president of the united states ― not vice president of the united states.
biden has promised that passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would be a priority during his first 100 days in office. he is also planning to reform the criminal justice system to lessen incarceration, particularly in the black and latino communities for whom it is disproportionately onerous.

while texas is unique in having a group claiming to be the legitimate government of the republic of texas, it is not alone in having an independence movement (texas nationalist movement). the alaska independence party is the state's third largest political party with over 13,000 registered members, while hawaii has several organizations pushing for sovereignty.
washington -- after six years of anticipation, house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) has finally unveiled what republicans are calling their alternative to obamacare: a 37-page document that reads like a mission statement and lacks details on what, exactly, the gop would put in place of the health care law now benefitting 20 million people.
republicans, meanwhile, are desperate to change the subject and seem to be goading democrats to attack barrett's religious beliefs, perhaps recalling that they received a political boost from the nomination of justice brett kavanaugh after he was accused of sexual assault. (multiple gop operatives suggested hawaii sen. mazie hirono, a member of the senate judiciary committee, might go after barrett's catholicism.)
trump's baseless assertion is illogical on its face. it requires americans to believe that obama is devious enough to have ordered an unfounded prosecution of flynn to hamstring trump's presidency, but not devious enough to have publicized the ongoing fbi probe into the trump campaign's links with russia prior to election day 2016.
i have looked at my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and i say, as many issues as i have with some of the republican things, you guys have a lot more problems, she said. as long as i maintain the deliberation and the thought and the consideration for each issue that comes before me, and vote in a manner that i think is best for the people i work for, i think that's what is more important.

the affordable care act didn't legislate short-term plans out of existence, but it allowed the federal government to regulate them aggressively. the obama administration did just that, issuing rules that limited the plans to durations of no more than three months.
here they are: the department of health and human services announced monday that the premiums for benchmark plans on the exchanges ― those used to set the size of subsidies that most exchange customers receive ― would rise an average of 25 percent next year in the 39 states that use the federal exchange system on healthcare.gov.

experts believe that black msm may also shy away from seeking out prep for fear that having a truvada prescription would expose them to scorn from homophobic family members. black msm considering prep may face further internal conflicts if they don't identify as gay. fears that physicians holding the keys to a prep prescription may be yet another source of stigma and sex shaming could be quite justified in some cases, given the pervasive ignorance about prep in the medical field. and even though there are often ways to access prep for free, black msm may automatically assume that such an expensive drug is out of their reach financially and not even explore payment options.

• voted against barring job discrimination based on sexual orientation.
that all of this should be happening in kentucky is ironic. although a relatively conservative state, smack in the heart of what now qualifies as trump country, kentucky enthusiastically embraced the affordable care act when it became law. it took advantage of new federal money to expand its medicaid program, so it would be available to all people with incomes below or just above the poverty line.
so, too, has beshear. always bevin's most likely opponent in 2019, the son of popular former gov. steve beshear used his post as state attorney general to antagonize bevin, particularly through lawsuits that attempted to block some of the governor's biggest priorities. beshear quickly allied himself with the teacher movement, greeting them on the steps of the capitol during the protests and taking up their cause. he sued bevin to block the implementation of the pension bill, and in december, the kentucky supreme court ruled in his — and teachers' — favor.
of course, these groups also oppose more incremental proposals like biden's because they would still reduce provider revenue, albeit a lot more modestly. one argument in favor of promoting medicare for all is that it moves the boundaries of the political debate, so that these less aggressive initiatives come to seem more reasonable by comparison, and perhaps easier to pass.
state democratic officials who are defending the law plan to immediately appeal the ruling directly to the supreme court, california attorney general xavier becerra said at a news conference held after the 5th circuit issued its ruling. the supreme court already has rejected two other challenges to the constitutionality of obamacare.
there were rumors then that mulvaney would be ousted, but he was able to hang on for months longer.
when trump ultimately won the nomination, party leaders did their best to keep trump's statements to prepared speeches delivered off a teleprompter, in the hopes of limiting off-script remarks that could hurt the chances of republican congressional candidates.
early on, his campaign believed it could contend in those areas, and conservative educators, angry over bevin's targeting of teachers, helped: some even canvassed for beshear just three years after voting for trump.
in other words, it is impossible, under current law, to go out and buy contraceptive-only coverage on the exchanges. that would amount to creating a new program, as sotomayor said. these marketplaces are intended for people whose employers don't even offer them health benefits, not for people seeking supplemental coverage of some kind.
and the proposal would give an extra $13 per hour in hazard pay to essential workers in health care, food retail, public safety and transportation.
a federal appeals court on wednesday ruled that the affordable care act's individual mandate is unconstitutional, putting insurance for 20 million americans in jeopardy and threatening to throw the health care system into chaos.
this could turn into a policy problem, because excessive cuts could cause genuine access problems, and it's already a political problem, because doctors and hospitals have a lot of influence. a new, industry-funded group fighting medicare for all includes among its members three of the nation's most powerful provider groups: the american medical association, the american hospital association, and the federation of american hospitals.
in light of the upcoming presidential election, of course gaining a competitive edge is one of the most difficult aspects for the campaigners. but even with their growing calls for lessened taxes and increased minimum wages, candidates are missing the point: america's lack of affordable housing contributes greatly to the root of many of their socio-economic problems. but why isn't it being discussed in more detail?
let me just say this, because i think it's important to say this clearly: we're not beholden to anybody except the right answer for the american public.
but the democratic candidates agree on a lot more than opposition to repeal of the affordable care act. each one of them recognizes that, even with the law in place, tens of millions of americans still can't afford medical care, either because they still don't have insurance or the insurance they have leaves them with some combination of premiums and out-of-pocket costs they cannot afford.
former cdc chief: increased testing doesn't account for surge in cases— 6/28/20, 11:40 a.m. et
vice president mike pence has said that, should republicans keep control of both the house and senate after november's midterm elections, they will give repeal another shot. it may seem strange, given the likelihood that the 2017 repeal effort created such a backlash. but republicans could always tweak their old proposals and then mislead constituents about what those proposals would do ― in other words, what they are doing now ― in the hopes of squeezing through some kind of bill next time.
that is far higher than the comparable figure for comprehensive plans. because of affordable care act regulations, only 20 percent of the money charged for premiums can go to overhead and profit. the rest is supposed to pay for medical services (or for efforts to improve the quality of those services).
throughout his extensive tenure at the department of the interior, dan has distinguished himself with his integrity, an incredible work ethic, humility, and dedication to interior's mission, bernhard said in a statement.
these new policies are intended to make the exchanges more attractive to insurance companies next year, after more insurers pulled out of the program this year. consumers may be forced to endure more hassles in order to keep insurers in the fold because without the insurers, there's no coverage to buy.
he suggested that joe biden would confiscate guns. that's baseless. biden is running on a non-mandatory buyback of so-called assault weapons.
buttigieg has said that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and for that reason his plan focuses on bringing the uninsured into the system. the program would automatically enroll anybody eligible for free coverage through either medicaid or the public option, and it would provide a streamlined one-click enrollment option for people whose incomes made them eligible for subsidies.
patients find themselves unable to pay uva bills for many reasons: they are uninsured or sometimes have short-term coverage that does not pay for treatment of preexisting illnesses. or they are out-of-network, or have a high-deductible plan — increasingly common coverage that can require patients to pay more than $6,000 before insurance kicks in. virginia's medicaid expansion, effective this year, covers families with low income but is still projected to leave hundreds of thousands uninsured.
there is too much satire to pass up in trump vs. hillary. it is time to take a fun look at what life may be like when hillary clinton or donald trump become the president.
the guy who runs the miami resort where trump appeared tuesday knows this is false, too.
but these debates point to the biggest divide among the different democratic contenders to challenge trump in 2020: how, exactly, should the party try to implement its agenda? whichever strategy eventually triumphs will have major implications for the party's approach and level of ambition when it regains power.
whitmer campaigned for governor as somebody who could get things done, like fixing the damn roads, by citing her history of bipartisan work in the state senate. but gop lawmakers are already pushing to block or overturn some of her early moves, including a rollback of snyder-era changes that give business groups more sway over environmental regulations.

because of this, some republican voices have begun warning others to reconsider their current approach to repealing and replacing obamacare. sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) in particular has warned house members not to vote on the current bill as is because it might not get the necessary 50 votes to pass the senate and certainly won't have the 60 votes needed for any follow-up legislation.
barrett's record and writing on obamacare
it's a real possibility because the court is hearing a new challenge to the law one week after the election. and by that time, trump appointee amy coney barrett is likely to be on the bench.
he was able to cut through that national noise. when bevin was talking about impeachment and donald trump, he was talking about things that matter to people in their daily life like health care and education and roads, said rhode island gov. gina raimondo, chair of the democratic governors' association. this is a repeatable strategy.
in all of these respects, the more incremental plans would push the u.s. health care system in the same direction that medicare for all would: there would be more financial protection, a bigger role for government-provided insurance, and more federal regulation of health care prices. and remember, this is now the consensus position even for the democratic candidates who are moderates.
but the tax credits cut off once household income hits four times the poverty line ― which, for a family of four, works out to about $105,000 a year. and silver plans aren't that generous: they cover roughly 70% of the typical person's medical costs, which means they can have deductibles of several thousand dollars.
the effects of even such a partial ruling would still be far-reaching, as health care organizations and experts who filed friend-of-the-court briefs attested. insurers selling policies directly to individuals would face an entirely different legal environment and have to redesign their products. people with conditions such as diabetes, cancer and hiv who try to buy coverage on their own would lose their guarantees of access. even people with employer-sponsored insurance could lose some of the protections that the law gives them.
limiting hospital prices could save a lot of money
in most cases, medicaid and chip programs don't charge premiums for children or adults (though some states do), and these programs typically require only small cost-sharing like copayments.
but now ― and perhaps to them unexpectedly ― congressional republicans face the crisis of an incoming presidential administration that will sign their repeal-and-replace bills into law. which means the zero hour has finally arrived, and republicans must undertake the dread mission they've been putting off.

look, we have great respect for the institution of the supreme court of the united states, the vice president said. but chief justice john roberts has been a disappointment to conservatives — whether it be the obamacare decision or whether it be a spate of recent decisions all the way through calvary chapel.
now the administration says it will hang the aca around democrats' necks until it implodes, rather than even attempting to make it better, and turn its attention to tax reform. is that really what is best for the american people? is that is what is best for people facing serious and life threatening illnesses?

but most employers are likely to keep offering insurance, at least for the time being, because they will still have plenty of incentive to do so. although it's entirely possible millions would move from employer plans into the public option ― or subsidized private insurance, like the kind available through healthcare.gov ― it'd predominantly be people who switched because it allowed them to save money.
and there was no doubt that house republican whip tom delay (texas) realized that politically, clinton had won. according to the 1997 book mirage by george hager and eric pianin, delay went home and rewatched the state of the union speech at 1:30 a.m.
last month, a different u.s. judge ruled against aetna's proposed deal for humana.
my immigrant parents were shocked that a nation as wealthy as ours does not recognize health care as a human right, and they're right to be shocked. if the supreme court strikes down the aca, i will be at risk again ― and i will not be alone. millions of americans could lose protections and that could literally be deadly for many of us. we must do whatever we can to ensure that this country continues to provide affordable health care for all people. none of us should have to depend on luck to stay alive.
president donald trump was at it again on thursday night, promising to protect health care for many millions of americans while he's actually trying to take it away.
today, mr. trump, asked to defend his assertion that he opposed the iraq war before it started, replied simply that he was not a politician, so there might not be a public record of his opposition. but his repeated statement that we have lost too many lives and too much treasure in stupid wars in the mideast resonates, as perhaps it should.
schumer has blocked senate committees from meeting as scheduled and delayed passage of a short-term bill funding the government. democrats are also expected to keep the senate in session next week in hopes of keeping vulnerable republicans off the campaign trail. mcconnell, meanwhile, has responded by scheduling more votes on confirming judicial nominees.
update: march 2 ― sen. orrin hatch (r-utah) has issued an apology for his comments regarding obamacare supporters. the tweet appears below.
remember when the president solemnly swore his large adult sons would stay out of politics and focus on running the family business? https://t.co/1rwc1bte1g — emily q. hazzard (@eqhazzard) february 15, 2019
i would notice that obama, over time, would get more death threats. despite being billed as a unifier when he was running for office, he was just as swiftly turned into a polarizing figure, hated by certain kinds of whites, revered by most black folks even as a growing chorus wondered, aloud, what he was doing for us.
this weekend america will remember not only the horror of those attacks, but also the heroism of our response, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said thursday on the senate floor, spilling a little bit of the glory on himself.
rep. peter roskam (r-ill.) noted he was getting a lot of feedback from his district on obamacare ― protesters have zeroed in on roskam as a vulnerable republican ― and that he was listening carefully and looking to make a smooth transition from the status quo to a new approach.
too many people have had to make difficult decisions about whether they should quit school, give up a job or their home because they couldn't afford to pay their bills and pay for medical care. they have been forced to choose between living their lives and living ― and that's not ok. that should never be allowed.
in the last congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic va reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

instead of saying the president committed crimes and should be impeached, mueller's report suggested that the president may have committed crimes and that it's not up to the u.s. justice department to accuse a president of wrongdoing.
that was something president trump was discussing, and you know he processes stuff out loud. and that's fine, budd said.

prior to obamacare, abortion was a standard covered benefit in most private health insurance. but state lawmakers have clamped down, and many states now forbid insurance from covering abortion, even for women who don't receive federal subsidies for their insurance.
if we are just recovering back to where we were on march 12, when the governor declared a state of emergency, that's not good enough, she added. there are lives at stake.
that bill would have reduced government spending, freeing up money for tax cuts, thus fulfilling longtime republican goals. but it proposed to do so by taking huge sums out of medicaid and reducing spending on subsidies for people buying private insurance.
it's one thing to say that, on average, people in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care. it's quite another thing to say that every single person in the lower 90% of the income scale would pay less for their health care.
amanda terkel contributed to this report.
the absence of a more robust expansion of health care is one of several provisions in the bill that is already disappointing progressive lawmakers and activists.
unfortunately, prep has tended to make the greatest traction in major urban areas outside the south. and these cities are still often failing their local black msm populations with regard to prep.
he also addressed head-on the worries about disruption. sanders has always been forthright that his plan would mean eliminating existing private insurance, including employer-sponsored coverage, and that it would require people to pay the equivalent of a tax rather than premiums. on monday, he mocked the idea that americans would be upset about the shift, when what they really care about is keeping their doctors and hospitals ― and keeping their costs under control.
democratic congressional campaign committee chairwoman cheri bustos (d-ill.) told huffpost on tuesday that health care is the ballgame.
these democrats argue that the lawsuit has no merit, and they have the weight of the legal establishment on their side. even lawyers aligned with republicans who shaped previous challenges to the affordable care act have said they think this latest challenge should fail.
it sounds like something out of a star trek episode with a rupture in the space-time continuum, but legal experts huffpost consulted were genuinely uncertain how officials would sort it out. it's almost impossible to wrap your brain around how this would actually work, said sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university.
trump has also repeatedly — and inaccurately — criticized obama for his handling of the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic, falsely claiming that obama ignored that problem. on sunday, he said that was the reason he has not tried to contact obama for advice with the coronavirus pandemic.
arizona democrats are prepared to pounce on any shift.
what michigan got right ― and other states didn't
other women were told to pump in their manager's office or a meeting room without locks, where they were walked in on repeatedly. many had to pump in view of security cameras. in two separate cases, restaurant workers were instructed to pump behind the bread racks, leaving them partly visible to colleagues and customers.
ernst's fellow senator, chuck grassley (r-iowa), also faced hostile crowds at a town hall event on tuesday. constituents asked questions about the affordable care act and about grassley's decision to block hearings on former president barack obama's supreme court nominee, merrick garland.
i think she's been working real well, especially trying to get the dairy pride act passed through, bowe said after a roundtable discussion on dairy farming in altoona with baldwin.
and the record backs up his recollection. during the debate over the tax cut, when lawmakers were talking about the effects of reducing the mandate penalty to zero, pat toomey, the gop senator from pennsylvania, went out of his way to say that republicans were only taking away the penalty. we don't change the rules, he said.
parents also see significant health benefits: a 2015 study published in social science & medicine found women who are given paid maternity leave with full benefits are 16.2 percent less likely to become depressed than women without paid leave. another study found that women who have paid maternity leave are significantly less likely to experience depression later in life.
trump is learning this lesson now. the current shutdown is the longest in history, with no end in sight. he continues to insist on money for his border wall, while democrats refuse to give it to him.
few, if any, thought trump could actually win, and therefore gave little thought to running and staffing the government's executive branch.
patrick raycraft/hartford courant via getty images michael song, at right, and his wife, kristen, center, along with legislators and gun-safety advocates, pushed for connecticut to create requirements for safe gun storage. the bill was named ethan's law in memory of the son the songs lost in a firearm accident at a friend's home.
smaller cuts would require trade-offs on coverage or cost
my bet is that most employers would stop offering health benefits once their workers have access to medicare for all, larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the henry j. kaiser foundation, told huffpost. but, if the medicare plan proves less attractive than private insurance, lots of employers might keep providing coverage to attract employees with good health insurance like they do today. 
this public option would be essentially free to many lower- and even some middle-income people and offer better benefits than most private plans. but warren would let employers continue to offer coverage to employees, at least at first. she'd also leave the existing medicare and medicaid programs as they are, though she'd improve medicare benefits for seniors.
trump didn't endorse johnson in minnesota, but johnson made pawlenty's criticisms of the president ― he called him unhinged and unfit a few weeks before the 2016 election ― a central part of his campaign. it helped him best pawlenty with 53 percent of the vote, even defeating the former governor in his home county.
for example, when 22-year-old benedict college student faith dupree goes to the ballot box, her most pressing concerns are the black maternity mortality crisis and voter suppression. but 18-year-old mykel king, a first-time voter and student at the same college, is most concerned about prison reform, climate change and student loan debt. sheila albergottie, a 64-year-old educator originally from st. louis, has child care, health care and the student loan debt crisis on the top of her mind. these three columbia residents are a small sample of black voters, and they show how black communities can have backgrounds, beliefs and political values that differ and often overlap.
planned parenthood health centers provide a range of health care services for both men and women ― including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and screening for cervical and other cancers. the carol whitehill moses center in dc opened in september and is expected to provide care for more than 12,000 people within its first year.
polls have shown, consistently and conclusively, that the public does not want the affordable care act thrown out. whatever their thoughts about obamacare, voters want its expansions of insurance and protections for preexisting conditions to stay in place.
the plaintiffs' argument draws on two significant developments from the nearly decade-long history of the affordable care act.
lavora barnes, chair of the michigan democratic party and obama's state director in 2012, says she isn't expecting a repeat of what happened four years ago.
in mid february, republicans won their only special election since november in a district outside minneapolis. but trump had carried it by a 61-32 margin, dailykos reported, and the republican winning by just 6 points was a huge collapse.
obamacare is a complete and total disaster, trump said.  it's imploding as we sit. trump predicted that 2017 would be the bad year and catastrophic.
parson's reelection campaign did not respond to a request for comment. public polling of the race between him and galloway has generally given the republican a small lead, but his handling of the coronavirus pandemic has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks.
it's dangerous, said the new democrat, to read too many national implications into this very low-turnout primary in new york.
although tipirneni's progressive policy stances put her comfortably in the democratic mainstream, she identifies as a moderate democrat and emphasizes her data-driven approach to policy.
the record on health care and preexisting conditions is just one reason for the gop's political problems and, obviously, a lot can happen between now and november. but 10 years of fighting obamacare is bound to register with the voters, especially if democrats have something to say about it.
new york, new jersey and rhode island currently offer paid parental and caregiving leave, and washington state, the district of columbia and massachusetts have policies set to start paying out within the next couple of years. these states offer between four and 12 weeks to new parents.
throughout the campaign, she continued reaching out to business groups and republicans. in another spot, released in october, the georgia democratic party noted she worked with the gop and fought to stop a massive tax hike on georgians.
whenever the need for comparative clinical or cost effectiveness research is raised, corporate stakeholders bring up a number of myths, such as cea would stifle innovation, it would lead to rationing of care, and how can you measure the value of health services anyway? cea is an established but underused discipline in this country. as one response to these myths, wouldn't it be a good idea to address the widespread overuse of full-body ct scanning as a screening technique, since more than 30 million such scans are performed every year, posing potentially harmful radiation exposure, without evidence of benefit or approval by the fda or the american college of radiology?

this kind of behavioral analysis has been available after twitter opened up its data pipe to researchers via projects such as gnip, which is an open source repository for social data.
the couple now has coverage from a policy bought from the aca's health insurance exchange, for which they receive financial assistance.
the party is confident that 2018 could be a big year for arizona, said drew anderson, spokesman for the arizona democratic party.
states must get permission from the federal government to impose these requirements, and so far 15 have either gotten it or are in the process of applying, which means getting permission from seema verma, the trump administration official in charge of medicaid. she has praised the idea repeatedly, arguing that the requirements encourage people to find jobs. it is not compassionate to trap people on government programs, or create greater dependency on public assistance as we expand programs like medicaid, she said in september.
it's getting worse, as predicted, biden said friday in michigan of the rising coronavirus numbers. the president knew and lied about knowing.
in july, the administration announced a dramatic cut in funding for navigators, which are the federally certified organizations that assist people with enrollment.
according to an estimate from gilead sciences, which manufactures truvada, about three quarters of the men who have filled a prep prescription are white while just 9 percent are black. considering the racial breakdown of the epidemic among msm, these figures are gravely lopsided.
two weeks ago, the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela, and its new interim president, juan guaido.
he spent the first year of his presidency trying furiously to push repeal legislation through congress and, when that failed, he tried to use his executive authority to undermine the law ― by, for example, slashing outreach funds or promoting work requirements in medicaid that would limit enrollment in the affordable care act's expansion of the program.
or, at the very least, you cannot do so without expecting a lot of resistance. although centralized systems in other developed countries deliver high quality, universal coverage at a fraction of what it costs in america, none of those other countries first had to dismantle a scheme as entrenched and expensive as the u.s. system.
joshua bekenstein, a co-chairman of bain capital, and his wife, anita bekenstein, together donated $162,000 to the serve america victory fund, a fundraising vehicle for the pac, last year and so far this year. (moulton raises money for the pac through a joint fundraising committee that enables him to raise vast sums as long as it is divided into maximum amounts of $2,700 to individual candidates.)

sparing a moment to talk about the 2020 presidential candidates during her lunch break at trinity education community and conference center in columbia's waverly neighborhood, the 58-year-old explained that she is split on who to support between sanders, buttigieg and warren.
still, a collins vote for kavanaugh would be no less of a betrayal to the reproductive rights movement — the final betrayal, ilyse hogue, the president of naral pro-choice america, called it. there is no going back. it doesn't matter how many times you voted not to defund planned parenthood if you pave the way to end roe in this country.
there are real lives at stake in this thing, obama said during the meeting, according to the attendee.
he and his republican allies have spent the last few years trying to take away preexisting condition protections, through legislation to repeal obamacare and a series of executive actions to undermine the law. more recently, trump has backed a lawsuit urging the supreme court to wipe out the affordable care act ― and with it the preexisting condition proviso ― because of a supposed constitutional flaw in the law.
pelosi took issue with its provisions to turn medicare into a voucher program for future retirees and bump up the retirement age above 65.
ahps are not subject to the same regulations that the affordable care act places on insurance that individuals and small businesses buy on their own. they don't have to cover all 10 of the law's essential benefits, for example, and they have a lot more freedom to vary premiums based on factors like age, occupation or gender.
he has an extensive record of having an entire line of chinese-made products, donnelly said in an interview. he's been involved very significantly in those things.
the investigator handling that case noted that the ordeal not only cost the family money but left the baby in pain due to the switch to formula. the investigator wrote that equitable relief should require walmart to reimburse the woman for the formula she paid for out of pocket, since she would not have had to purchase formula to begin with had walmart accommodated her as the law required.
the complexity makes it tough to explain and it doesn't envision the sort of wholesale transformation that would come with medicare for all, the proposal to replace existing insurance arrangements with a single government-run plan. under biden's plan, some americans still wouldn't have insurance and some of those with coverage would still struggle with high out-of-pocket costs.
when the invitation came to testify, they had to decide who would go. fluke explained to candidate confessional why she was chosen.

as she faces her toughest reelection battle yet in maine, collins has attempted to show independent-minded maine voters that she remains willing to buck her party when the moment calls for it.
under the obama rule, religious entities were exempt and an accommodation was created for religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, which some groups objected to for not going far enough.
the gop should probably admit crafting legislation is not their thing, maher added.
moreover, states like florida and texas enacted laws making it harder for insurance counselors to advise consumers. and many gop-led states joined in on lawsuits that threatened to fell the affordable care act at the supreme court.

try irreversible coma. trump's gop has become a trojan horse for plutocrats, theocrats, bigots and foreign powers hostile to america's democracy and core ideals.
however, anthony hopp, director of membership development at samaritan ministries, says there's a lot more to it.
when beshear argued that bevin was a bully who broke with kentucky's more polite politics, the teachers provided a relatable face of who, exactly, bevin had targeted.
we are grateful to senator sanders for including home and community-based long term services and supports (ltss) as part of the medicare for all bill, said nicole jorwic, senior director of public policy at the arc. the 'all' includes people on waiting lists for these services all over the country.
what republicans tried ― and are still trying ― to do
les moonves said that trump is bad for the country but he is terrific for cbs.
many of the older americans hardest hit by these changes live in rural, republican-leaning areas, according to an interactive analysis by the kaiser family foundation. under the house plan, 60-year-olds earning $30,000 a year would see their tax credits drop 75 percent or more in most of arizona and large swaths of western nebraska. the least affected states include solidly democratic washington, vermont, new york and massachusetts.
congress is preparing to go on its july 4th recess, a time when members contemplate the liberty, the sacrifices of our forebears and how to game the federal budget by killing a bunch of medicare recipients. thanks to this week's news cycle, we now know that spilling the beans on heidi cruz likely meant planting a story about her in the enquirer. and the president wants congress to repeal obamacare and worry about a replacement later, meaning we might finally get that trump to nation: drop dead daily news headline. this is huffpost hill for friday, june 30th, 2016, and we'll be back on wednesday:
this is an updated version of an article published on april 8.
the thinking behind this new lawsuit is that, with the penalty now zero, the mandate can't be a tax ― which means it has lost its constitutional validity, which means the whole thing has to come off the books.
in recent days, trump grew fond of the idea of replacing mulvaney with meadows, calling meadows on thursday to discuss the appointment, according to sources.
my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
part of the problem is that even the elements of trump's trade deals that liberals like ― such as boosting labor standards in mexico ― are not enough to curb the appeal of offshoring to a country with cheaper labor and fewer regulations. to stop that offshoring, the united states needs to invest in economic and infrastructure development in mexico to bring workers' earning power much closer to parity with the u.s., according to robert scott, epi's director of trade and manufacturing research.
you gotta get 218 votes on the floor of the house to do anything. and then you've gotta figure out a way to get, you know, theoretically, 60 votes in the senate, rep. dan kildee (d-mich.), the chief deputy whip of the democratic caucus, told huffpost on thursday, speaking of the majority vote threshold to pass bills in the house and the filibuster-proof majority in the senate.
vice president mike pence offered a withering take on chief justice john roberts this week, urging conservative americans to consider the destiny of the supreme court as they cast their votes this november.
recent decades have shown this claim to be completely false as the magic of the free market continues to create worsening access, higher costs, less affordability, and variable quality of care. but this time-worn meme is still pervasive and distorts this election year's contentious debate over the future of our health care system.
sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), who has endorsed the sanders bill, refuses to admit that taxes would go up, presumably because she doesn't want to give republicans fodder for an attack ad.
the medicaid expansion is the primary reason that the number of americans without insurance has fallen to historic lows. it's also the single biggest reason that, in the wake of a ruling invalidating the affordable care act, approximately 20 million fewer people would end up with coverage, according to projections by the nonpartisan urban institute.
can you imagine, colleagues, the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these 100 mosquitoes were outside this jar, not inside this jar? jolly said, displaying a swarming specimen container provided by a florida research college.
voters know where [candidates] stand on impeachment, this strategist said. those numbers have been static for months. this election is going to be about health care, so if you're a democrat in a swing district and you use your one minute with a voter to tell them where you stand on impeachment, you're wasting the opportunity to connect with them on the issue that's driving their vote.
pelosi said trump ought to drop his bungled efforts to repeal obamacare and focus instead on legislation that would create jobs.
so i decided to press slavitt on some of these questions in an interview.
public-sector workers appear again and again in the reports. a supervisor at detroit's water and sewerage department instructed a female employee who worked out in the field to pump in a mcdonald's bathroom. a field employee with the indiana department of transportation couldn't get adequate time to pump from her bosses and was eventually fired, allegedly for being absent without permission. after an investigation, the labor department brokered her reinstatement. the worker was owed more than $26,000 in backpay.
at the end of her speech accepting president bill clinton's nomination to the supreme court in 1993, ginsburg thanked her late mother, celia bader.
those who retained coverage they purchase themselves also would lose the guarantee that insurance plans would cover basic needs like hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care. those who have coverage from employers could again face annual and lifetime limits on how much their policies would cover. people with prescription drug coverage from medicare would face higher out-of-pocket costs.
one thing to remember is that barrett's vote might not be the decisive one anyway. many legal observers think that brett kavanaugh hinted in a previous decision that he was inclined to let the rest of the law stand. kavanaugh plus roberts and the three liberals would be five votes to let the program keep going.
then just two months later on june 16, trump announces his big news, so ladies and gentlemen, i am officially running for president of the united states.
abrams, as a black woman who spent years courting donors to fund voter registration projects targeting people of color through her new georgia project, is often given the shorthand label of a progressive. but her 2018 campaign showed just as much dedication to reaching out to the middle as it did to firing up her party's base.

without the affordable care act, i would have reached the lifetime max already of a million dollars. before the affordable care act, that was a constant strain, buckholt said. we are scared to death as to what's going to happen with the supreme court.

the state hasn't taken up the medicaid expansion and recently tried to allow health insurance companies to sell policies that ignore key aspects of obamacare, chiefly its ban on charging higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions.
despite trump's best efforts, more fundamental components of the law persist, including new rules requiring insurance companies to cover people with preexisting medical conditions and charge them the same rates as everyone else; a vastly expanded medicaid program for americans living at or near the federal poverty level; and the creation of an insurance marketplace where low- and moderate-income individuals can buy insurance at subsidized rates.
dreamer activists called on democrats earlier monday to not settle for mcconnell's promise to hold a vote. if they lose daca ― as an estimated 122 dreamers already are each day ― they will lose work permits and could be deported.
the ad is undeniably moving ― and wildly at odds with hawley's words and deeds on health care. the same goes for the promises of bishop and the other house republicans, whose efforts to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions are a matter of public record.
president donald trump on wednesday sent out another tweet on health care. republicans will totally protect people with pre-existing conditions, he wrote. democrats will not!
the bonkers argument now threatening obamacare
so you do see taking back congress and ultimately taking back the white house as a part of the policy solution here?
wyden told jorjani he has a nonexistent record of ethics enforcement as acting solicitor, noting that several inspector general investigations were closed after agency officials failed to cooperate with investigators' requests. as huffpost reported last may, jorjani took six months to respond to investigators probing zinke's apparent effort to bully sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) into supporting obamacare repeal last year, only to dodge their questions entirely.
cruz was trailing businessman donald trump in a poll released by the des moines register on saturday. in the days before the caucuses, the texas senator stumped in iowa with such famous faces as conservative host glenn beck, family leader president bob vander plaats and iowa rep. steve king (r).
it's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not. sabrina corlette, research professor, georgetown university
there's a lot going on in that line of reasoning, some sensical and some not-so-sensical, but the heart of the argument these republican officials are making is about what is known as severability ― the question of when courts can eliminate just one piece of the law, thus severing it from the statute, while leaving the rest in place. although experts argue over exactly how to answer that question, they all agree that the purpose of severability is to respect the will of congress.
read more on this from huffpost's paul blumenthal.
trump made the suggestion in a tweet. as always, it's difficult to know how seriously to take the comment ― or whether to take it seriously at all.
on the second day of his confirmation hearing before the senate, kavanaugh called the opinion one of the greatest moments in judicial history.
and the comedian took aim at the gop's proposed replacement for obamacare and trump's baseless claims that former president barack obama wiretapped trump tower in the run up to the 2016 presidential election.
health insurance exchange policies tend to be expensive without subsidies, as are insurance plans purchased directly from an insurance company. the average price of the benchmark mid-level silver plans sold on exchanges like healthcare.gov is $462 a month this year, and those policies can have deductibles in the thousands of dollars that must be paid before full coverage kicks in.
all of those obstacles doesn't mean mayville and strizich are crazy for trying to make idaho the latest state to take up the medicaid expansion, which would make health benefits available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (for a single person, the 133 percent figure is about $16,000).
obamacare repeal effort also made an impression
the trump administration is reportedly looking at moving legislation concerning tax reform and infrastructure simultaneously, using the promise of infrastructure spending to win over democratic votes in order to pass tax reform. it is unclear, however, whether such a strategy could succeed, given the disagreement between democrats and republicans over how to fund infrastructure projects.

at the beginning of the congress, all but three democrats ― ocasio-cortez, ro khanna (d-calif.) and tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) ― voted for a rules package that included pay-as-you-go provisions that progressives thought were harmful to the medicare for all cause. and democrats have stayed in line thus far on efforts to impeach president donald trump or even to just acquire his tax returns.
this isn't the first time coverage for so many people is at the mercy of conservative, republican-appointed judges.
the goldstein race has the potential to be one of those sleeper races, said jonathan cohn, with progressive massachusetts, a statewide advocacy group. [lynch] doesn't have a strong presence. he's not particularly outspoken on much of anything. i think there is fertile ground to not do as well as people expect.

to katrina riley, a 69-year-old self-described moderate democrat, biden's long political resume would be a welcome change from president donald trump, who took office without having ever served in government or the military. riley also associates biden with a time she misses: i'd like barack obama back, she said.
sanders' work to protect the affordable care act from gop repeal attempts is an example of how this strategy works in the real world. beginning on january 15, 2017, with a rally alongside senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) in warren, michigan, sanders barnstormed the country, holding health care rallies in eight states to generate support for obamacare as republicans struggled multiple times to repeal it.
for moderate candidates like biden, support for greater access to government benefits may be enough to satisfy all but the most ardent single-payer supporters. but voters who are uncertain about the prospect of upending the entire health coverage system with medicare for all may also be unconcerned about candidates like sanders because they don't realize how much change his plan would bring.
in january, trump vowed insurance for everybody. on friday, price also promised, we don't believe that individuals will lose coverage at all. but that same day, house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) seemed to acknowledge his plan won't cover as many people, in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt.
when questioning the affordable care act's defenders, the justices spent the bulk of their time on the matter of whether the plaintiffs ― the republican states ― have standing to sue. there was also discussion of the merits of the argument on the mandate ― that is, whether it's an unconstitutional command now that the penalty is zero.
this is one way the buttigieg would build and improve upon the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
another piece of the affordable care act's machinery is grinding to a halt, at least for the moment, in what could be another effort to undermine the law by the trump administration.
obamacare allowed insurers to keep selling such plans, but it also gave the federal government authority to regulate them tightly.
but every democratic proposal, big or small, attempts to do what the affordable care act has tried to do: create a uniform, relatively generous standard for insurance and then give every american enough financial support to get it. every republican change so far, including the new rules for short-term and association plans, pushes the health care system in the opposite direction.
this kind of natural language processing is something that machines are increasingly capable of performing. for instance, researchers recently developed an accurate means of detecting empathy with the team believing this could be invaluable in psychotherapy sessions.
paid sick leave keeps our homes, offices and communities healthier while ensuring the family's economic security, the organization said.
those gop efforts sparked a tremendous backlash. but the effort to get a repeal bill through congress ended in the fall. it's possible that those memories have faded from public consciousness a bit, and that may even help explain trump's gradually, if modestly, improving approval numbers in the polls.
the central issue in that case was the affordable care act's individual mandate, the financial penalty for people who didn't buy insurance. the individual mandate is also the key issue in texas v. united states, though the argument this time around is ― by nearly all accounts ― a whole lot more loopy.
it's a problem we need to solve in the context of seeking universality, not in the context of throwing that idea away, he said. where do we want go as a nation? backward, so that these people with diabetes and chronic diseases again find themselves adrift?
trump's positions on what the health care system should look like have shifted wildly since his presidential campaign began.
the u.s. has seen more than 2.3 million reported coronavirus cases. but cdc director robert redfield said thursday that the true number of americans infected with covid-19 could be 10 times higher — or more than 20 million.
when i left the hospital, i was blind in one eye, weighed less than 100 pounds and was learning to walk again. still, i got a job as soon possible — at first as a telemarketer (a seated job, which i needed given my lack of strength). and, as soon as i was able, i started volunteering at my hometown hospital.
the death of ruth bader ginsburg is a tragedy for the country, which has lost a groundbreaking legal icon, and for the many causes she championed.
whether or not the high court takes the case right away, it's virtually certain to hear the case at some point. and if it rules against the affordable care act, as the lower courts have, the effects would be far-reaching and devastating.
trump's campaign, along with the republican national committee and associated groups, raised $247.8 million in september, well short of the $383 million raised by biden and the democratic national committee. to open october, the trump effort officially had $251.4 million in the bank, according to a campaign spokesman, compared with $432 million for biden.
the trump administration acknowledged it had changed positions in the case. early on, the administration argued that only certain key parts of the aca, such as protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, should be invalidated. but it said other important provisions such as medicaid expansion, subsidies for premiums and health insurance markets could continue to stand.
and i can tell you from running the medicaid program and the [children's health insurance program], where we need to be focused on is: are we investing in housing? are we investing in mental health? are we investing in transportation and nutrition in the community in ways that can help people get better access and care and stay healthier?
the plan does not specify exactly how the benchmarks will work or what might happen if, several years into the transition, the fledgling government plan isn't living up to the standards. but harris is vowing to set up a commonsense path to the new system and says the option to buy into medicare will be available to everybody right away.
the existing medicare for all proposals would basically eliminate private insurance because the new public program would cover everything, every single american would belong to it and the law would prohibit private insurers from offering anything similar.
cole said he didn't believe the renewed focus on republican efforts to repeal the affordable care act would make much of a difference in the long term ― it's going to be a blip on the political radar, he said ― but he certainly didn't appear afraid of another fight over obamacare or the house gop health care bill, the american health care act.
health care: more than 4.2 million latinos have gained insurance through the affordable healthcare act or obamacare, lowering the latino uninsured rate by nearly 8 percent. after spending years worrying whether they were one illness away from financial ruin, majorities of latinos will not support a candidate who threatens to eliminate one of the most successful public health innovations in decades. instead, latinos want a president who will expand coverage for a greater number of people and create improvements in preventative care. if you're running simply on a platform to turn back the clock and repeal obamacare, latinos will run the other way.
today, anyone who gets health insurance from an employer already doesn't pay taxes on the value of that fringe benefit. this proposal would level the playing field for people who buy health coverage directly from an insurer, although they already can deduct the cost now under limited circumstances.
trump's tweet seemed to be endorsing an idea that sen. ben sasse (r-neb.) floated minutes earlier on fox news and, according to the the wall street journal, in a formal letter to the white house ― that if senate leaders can't assemble a majority by july 10, they should try a different strategy: vote to repeal the bill outright, or at least strip its funding, and then spend a month in non-stop hearings and negotiations to hammer out a deal on a new coverage scheme.
they elected the character donald trump played on tv. they elected the character on 'the apprentice,' who's smart, who's decisive, who's a global business leader, said gop consultant wilson. he stumbles into this office. of course he's overmatched since day one. you would not put this person in charge of a waffle house, let alone the white house.
because it is now officially open season for all the unfair and unbalanced disgruntled moron hunters of america who have been given permission by their idiot king candidate to do whatever they want, say whatever they want, without any fear of any kind of reprisal.
but the general election comes first. and with voters facing a choice between a democrat (biden) whose agenda would provide coverage to millions and a republican (trump) whose agenda ― despite his misleading rhetoric ― would take coverage from millions, the different factions seem willing to play up what they have in common. and that's a defense of obamacare and belief in the principle of universal coverage, notwithstanding their differences over how to get there.
fixing these would not put a stop to nursing home covid-19 deaths. but it would almost certainly reduce them and, along the way, improve the quality and safety of eldercare and the lives of the people who provide it.
in its survey, aarp used its own estimate that buying insurance would cost many seniors as much as $8,400 more per year under the house republicans' plan. when aarp asked respondents whether they view the age rating provision as levying an age tax for that reason, 55 percent of voters said they did, including 51 percent of trump voters.
if you are repealing, show us what you'll replace it with first, and then we'll look at what you have and see what we can do. they're repealing it. we're not. it's their obligation to come up with replace first. and i think we have unanimity within our democratic caucus on that position, he said. if we put forward a plan first, they'd reject it.

the gauge for how far we can go on some of these issues is around the 40 people that have given us the majority, rep. tim ryan (d-ohio), a former presidential candidate himself, told huffpost on thursday.
a dramatic gender gap of 40 points in the state may be influencing how both senate candidates are communicating with voters in the final weeks of the race.
that would mean insurers would no longer be subject to guaranteed issue (a requirement that they sell policies to anybody, regardless of medical status) or community rating (a prohibition on charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions).
evers showed, and spoke briefly, at each event. but he wasn't the main draw for either politician — both spoke effusively about his ticket-mate, democratic sen. tammy baldwin. and he wasn't a headliner — nina turner, the former ohio state senator who leads our revolution spoke after evers, and for longer, at sanders' rally.
jayapal, the lead author of the medicare for all bill, told huffpost on wednesday that she does have commitments to get hearings on her measure, starting with the rules committee under the control of longtime liberal champion jim mcgovern (d-mass.) and then moving to the budget committee. she hopes to eventually get hearings in the energy and commerce committee as well as in ways and means, but she hasn't asked for a vote.
since trump's election, republicans in congress have been debating their options. faced with the need to do something as quickly as possible, gop leaders have endeavored to build consensus around a plan to repeal and delay ― a process by which the underlying funding for the affordable care act would be scuttled, but the mechanics of the law would be left in place. then, by backstopping hospitals against financial risk and bailing out insurers during the interregnum so that they continue serving their existing customers (and so that hundreds of news stories about people losing all or part of their coverage are staved off), republicans would buy themselves some time to, you know, come up with the thing they've been promising to deliver for eight years.
8. the check isn't in the mail
a democratic super pac with the blandly patriotic name duty and country announced it planned to attack the other two major candidates in the gop primary, u.s. rep. evan jenkins and state attorney general patrick morrisey. it wasn't immediately clear who funded the group, but later campaign finance filings revealed most of its cash came from senate majority pac, which is controlled by senate democratic leader chuck schumer.
i still believe that it was the right vote for me, and if i had to do it all over again, it would be the same vote, she said. i have moved on, and i think most alaskans have as well.
why pre-existing conditions are such a big deal
after a walmart employee wrapped up her maternity leave in 2015, she walked into her carson city, nevada, store with an electric breast pump in tow. she was intent on breastfeeding her new baby. walmart was legally obligated to help her do it by providing a private space and enough breaks so she could pump breast milk. but the slow-moving disaster that unfolded over her first weeks back illustrated the many challenges breastfeeding moms like her still face on the job.
medicare for all proponents learned from the gop's relentless attacks on the affordable care act that even incremental change will bring accusations of rampant socialism, so they might as well go for the whole thing.
when deposed, the official acknowledged that he was trying to avoid disclosure of these communications in the antitrust litigation and that aetna officials had decided to carry on further conversations by phone in order to avoid a paper trail that could come out in legal proceedings.
for instance, democrats are again trying to pass real paid sick leave provisions, after seeing their proposals gutted by senate republicans and the white house back in march. they aim to provide state and local governments with $1 trillion, and set aside $200 billion for essential workers.
at his press conference in may, mueller said his report was his testimony, and that he hoped and expected it would be the only time that i will speak about this matter.
the tax act largely and disproportionately helps caucasians at the possible expense of those who are non-caucasian, soled said. republicans didn't have an agenda [of] 'how do we hurt the non-caucasians?' but congress should be proactive in trying to reform the tax code in a way that doesn't perpetuate or worsen income inequality, he added.
in a fox news interview taped july 17 and aired two days later, trump told chris wallace:
this year's benchmark plan comes from molina, a national insurer that has traditionally focused on low-income populations. like most of the company's plans around the country, the benchmark molina plan offers a narrow network of doctors and providers. it also has a high deductible. but lower-income people get extra financial assistance to reduce the deductible, and the network includes well-regarded teaching hospitals like harper university hospital and detroit children's. doctor supply doesn't seem to be a problem, either. the huffington post reached out to several physician practices on the official provider list, and each one confirmed that it was taking new molina patients.
like with seemingly everything else, trump appears incapable of just accepting the facts.

republicans had hoped for other benefits from the nomination. they believed it could help boost their incumbent senators in gop-leaning states by forcing voters back to their partisan corners, and could provide a fundraising boost to at least partially offset the tens of millions of dollars democratic candidates and groups raised in the hours and days following ginsburg's death.
medicare for america envisions automatic enrollment so that the new public program would take in everybody now on existing government plans, including medicare and medicaid, as well as the uninsured and people buying private coverage on their own. employees of businesses with private benefits could accept company insurance or jump into the new public program.
and that was the end of the story ― or so it seemed. but in 2017, trump and the republicans zeroed out the mandate penalty as part of broader tax cut legislation. as a result, americans no longer face a choice between buying insurance and paying a fee. they face a choice of buying insurance and doing nothing.
you don't think that provides any policy lessons about the sorts of expansion that work best?
each argument represents one piece of the larger truth. the big problem with medicaid, as even staunch defenders admit, is that the program pays doctors very little ― and, as a result, it can be difficult to get specialist appointments. the big problem with the affordable care act's private plans is that they tend to have high out-of-pocket costs, enough to keep even people with insurance from getting care they need.
top democratic strategists said trump's new fixation on obamagate is clearly an attempt to change the subject as the coronavirus death toll in the united states climbs toward 90,000 less than three months after trump promised that it would be zero.
the debate over the new proposal comes against a backdrop of rising popularity for law currently in place. americans favor the obama administration's affordable care act by an average 5-point margin, according to hufffpost pollster's aggregate, up from a negative score as recently as last october.
pelosi, who is expected to return to the house speakership thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.
even though outright repeal appears to be off the table, there are still efforts to undermine the law. the big gop tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don't get insurance. without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.
the pro-obamacare group protect our care has already launched a tv ad urging senators to stop any nominee who will support trump's lawsuit that overturns health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. it will be running in washington, d.c., as well as in bangor, maine, and anchorage, alaska ― where sens. susan collins and lisa murkowski will be sure to see the spot, since they're considered the two republicans most likely to potentially vote against a trump pick.
phil boyce, head of programming at salem, said he never told walsh that he could not criticize trump, only that trump bashing was going to hurt his ratings and decrease revenue. he did drive away half his listeners, boyce said.
it doesn't sound rational because those are the things that donald trump said, inslee said. we are not going to eliminate cars. we are not going to eliminate trains. we're going to have what i have in my driveway today which is a blue gm bolt made in michigan with american workers.
before, he was saying he was waiting for him to get sworn in, cummings said. he got sworn in. then he said he was willing to give him a chance to get his cabinet set. so we'll see.
the ceremony comes at a time when many progressive women feel that their access to safe and affordable reproductive care is under attack. emboldened by president-elect donald trump's victory, republicans in congress are pushing forward with plans to strip planned parenthood of its federal funding. house speaker paul ryan announced last week that this provision will be included in a special bill republicans are preparing that seeks to repeal obamacare.
both the doctor and the surgeon seemed confident the growth was benign. it wasn't. a biopsy showed that danielle had clear-cell sarcoma, a rare, potentially lethal cancer that typically affects people aged 20 to 40. suddenly, danielle needed another, more invasive operation. and she had to get it at an academic medical center in omaha two hours away, because the doctors closer to her home in norfolk, a farming and manufacturing city of about 25,000 residents, had never seen it before.
without the backing of the federal government, a group of democratic state attorneys general, led by becerra of california, were left to stand in as defendants. numerous organizations representing physicians, hospitals and other segments of the health care system also oppose the lawsuit.
ultimately, the test of reform isn't whether it leaves a flawed status quo in place. it's whether it brings america closer to a place where everybody can get health care when they need it. biden can defend his plan on those grounds without hesitation.
that is what democracy looks like, equals, yes, but also having the humility and dignity to listen to those who have been victimized by whatever power and privilege you might have. you have both historical and present-day benefits. so, the questions: what are you going to do, to challenge that, in your white communities, within your white families?
former vice president joe biden accused trump of undermining protections for people with preexisting conditions. trump responded by insisting we guaranteed preexisting conditions ― a brazen, if familiar, lie.

i think it is a dream, ocasio-cortez said thursday.
if you talk to the executives who run these hospitals and the analysts who study them, they will tell you that there is no single strategy administrators use to make operations more efficient. instead, it's simply a matter of finding lots of little ways to do more for less money ― whether it's refusing to buy every new tool specialists request, even when older ones will do just fine, or checking in on patients after they've left the hospital.
the affordable care act, aka obamacare, provides financial incentives to introduce innovative cost-saving programs and, in the face of greater financial pressure, more hospitals might adopt them.

while decidedly on the defensive on the ground in key states, trump released a scathing new ad on friday attacking biden's record on race. specifically, the ad seizes on biden's support for a criminal justice law that disproportionately punished people of color.

mental health protection is something the country supports: a recent poll found that the majority of americans ― regardless of political party ― think mental health care should be covered by insurance.
keeping the same policy and paying the full premium may make sense for unemployed people who can afford it, she said. for example, a pregnant woman may not want to switch policies and doctors prior to giving birth, or a person in the middle of medical treatments may prefer to have continuity of care.

as for the coverage loss, bishop assured the detroit free press that he was confident that congress will build on the progress outlined in this report to make health care work for everyone. he didn't specify how (and his campaign spokesman did not respond to questions huffpost submitted monday morning).

he claimed, again, that he banned travel from china and europe. no, he imposed partial restrictions with many exemptions, tens of thousands of people continued traveling over.
instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the affordable care act by giving americans more choice, reducing health care costs, making our health care system less complex to navigate, a senior biden campaign official told reporters sunday. and he will not support any policies that would mean getting rid of obamacare.
from day one of the obama administration, mitch mcconnell and his patriotic country of old white men (with the exception of john boehner) gathered together like a meeting of the dons and made it their one single purpose to block anything that our new president was going to try to do by any means necessary.
enrollment on the health insurance exchanges dipped this year, partly because the trump administration halted some outreach and advertising the obama administration planned for the end of the 2017 sign-up period.
in a huffpost/yougov poll released this week, just 39% of voters approve of trump's handling of coronavirus issues, and only 35% approve of the federal government response.

there were more ambitious options, too, like opening up medicaid to individual buyers or creating state tax credits to supplement the existing federal ones. these ideas, which have come up for discussion in other states, would have entailed their own trade-offs ― including, most likely, additional government spending. that's true of reinsurance, as well. but the sums would be relatively modest, depending on the option, and all would leave in place those protections for pre-existing conditions.
liz morris, the deputy director of the center for worklife law, said she would like to see the law amended to allow for damages so that firms that break the law face greater consequences. there may be no financial implications for the employer if they completely ignore the law, morris said. in my opinion, it's the biggest problem.
and then there's this, which comes close to making no sense:
michigan has been a case study in what the expansion can accomplish. approximately 680,000 residents now have health insurance through the expansion, and as a result they are more likely to get medical care (like treatment for heart conditions) and less likely to experience financial distress (like running up credit card debts), according to studies by researchers at the university of michigan.
and none of her outreach to the center took away from her work to register and turn out minority and young voters who were more likely to support democrats. at the same time, she largely avoided embracing left-wing policy priorities like medicare for all and abolishing immigration and customs enforcement.
the president has also pointed his finger at others. he first attributed the loss to democrats' unwillingness to cooperate, despite never reaching out to them.
studies have shown that health care prices in the u.s. are outrageously high by international standards. knee replacements cost $28,000 on average in the u.s., for example, while they cost $18,000 in the u.k. in a medicare for all system, the government would force american prices down ― not all the way down to european levels, but enough to get a better handle on costs here.
it would depend on the policy details, and even then there'd be room for debate about exactly how real or serious the effects would be. but the industry would do its best to scare people, which brings us to the other problem with medicare for all: politically, it'd run into massive opposition from the health care sector. and few industries wield as much political power.
suspending payments that insurers were planning to get could make that problem worse in the future, by making insurers who want to provide better coverage to sicker people even more reluctant to do so.
well, that's an issue that i have. i need more information about the credits and also about the fact that it looks like the credits are the same amount whether you make the bottom of pay scale, or income scale, or the top.
by high prices and unaffordable costs. the costs of health insurance and care have reached more than25,000 a year for a typical family of four insured by an average employer-sponsored ppo (4), having doubled over the last ten years--clearly a huge burden when we consider that the median household income is now about53,000.

planned parenthood also has a more complicated relationship with collins than straight-up advocacy groups do; the group still has to operate clinics across the country and relies on people like the senator for funding for programs. maintaining at least a cordial working relationship with collins ― and other gop politicians ― is something planned parenthood arguably has to do for its survival.
initially, the trump administration asked the court to eliminate only the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions, but later revised its stance by siding with the republican state officials who wanted to invalidate the entire law.

on friday, whitmer provided the trump administration with that confirmation, setting the stage for the work requirements to start next january. but in the official letter, whitmer repeated some of the objections she had made as a candidate ― and cited a new analysis, from the national consulting firm manatt, phelps and phillips, projecting that arkansas-level effects would mean 183,000 people on medicaid losing their insurance, or more than a quarter of the people who got coverage through the expansion.

this is our one chance to actually repeal obamacare and to give states flexibility, labrador said, suggesting he wants to see something that would cut at least some of the obamacare regulations and decrease premiums.

and hate isn't always so explosive. it often manifests as a quiet cruelty. last year, according to mekelburg's other former friend, the twitter troll stopped at a sunoco in fishkill to buy bananas at the gas station's convenience store. inside, she found an older man ― a muslim immigrant ― working behind the counter. mekelburg paid for her bananas but refused to speak to the man. she wouldn't look at him. she just threw a few bills on the counter. when the man tried to place some change in her hand, she made it clear to him that he was not to touch her.
some of the plans that aetna shut down were actually making money, the documents indicate. and aetna remained optimistic that obamacare plans would be profitable in the long run.
despite some of the policies instituted by the affordable care act, america's medical system is still plagued by problems. insurance premiums and drug prices have skyrocketed, leaving americans struggling to access affordable care. a 2016 survey of 11 countries from the commonwealth fund found that u.s. citizens were far more likely to go without care because it was too expensive.
one of the best judges of what the change means for people with pre-existing conditions are the organizations that represent such people. on wednesday, 29 of them ― including everybody from the american cancer society and american diabetes association to the march of dimes and national hemophilia foundation ― put out a statement warning that this dangerous action could take us back to the days when people with pre-existing conditions were openly discriminated against and blatantly denied access to lifesaving care.
trump has proposed or imposed policies that have weakened the aca's health insurance marketplace, limited access to medicaid for low-income people and sought ways around the aca's guarantee that people with preexisting conditions be allowed to buy health insurance at the same rates as everyone else. many of these policies are tied up in legal battles, and courts have blocked others.
but republicans also worry that mcsally's moves to win the primary may poison her chances in november against a democratic opponent who has been free to spend millions introducing herself to voters. after tuesday's primary, mcsally will have little time to pivot or restock her campaign resources.
rather than pick a fight that would have risked accusations that democrats were hostile to religion, obamacare's architects agreed that ministry members would not have to pay the mandate penalty, as long as the ministries met a handful of conditions ― such as submitting to regular audits in order to ensure solvency and covering medical conditions that arose after a member joined.
(the unnamed hhs official told the huffington post that email and automatic phone calls were among the outreach tools that remained available to the agency, but he would not clarify exactly what that meant.)
here's what i would tell the president: if you can't get a better deal and if you can't protect that 62-year-old worker in greenville from having dramatic premium increases because democrats won't work with you and you can't get the republican party on board, stop, take a time-out, let it collapse, sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) said on msnbc's morning joe. then turn to the democrats and say, 'this was the system you created. it has collapsed, now help me replace it.' that's what i would do.
funding comes largely from the federal government, and it too would vanish with a court ruling wiping out the affordable care act. states would have to quickly decide whether to continue covering some or all of these adults with their own funds, said judy solomon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities. it's doubtful many would be able to do that.
during the first week of medical school, i nearly passed out while walking up a flight of stairs. doctors at penn acted swiftly and within weeks, i had a diagnosis: inflammatory bowel disease. i started treatment but a few months later, the medications stopped working. i also kept this to myself, determined to just get through my classes. but by winter, i was making 20-odd trips to the bathroom every day, and i could barely handle that.
another event was the entrance of businesses into the hospital space. over the years, business jobs have become more common and much more powerful in health care. the people running hospitals are usually no longer doctors ― there's a layer of mbas that didn't used to be there. now, you find companies run by businesspeople who often have very little knowledge of the needs of medicine. they are, in the end, for-profit companies, and their goal is to maximize their revenue. i think they've done that very effectively.
i had no meetings with mitch mcconnell on how i was going to vote on witnesses. none. zero. i think it's tremendously sexist. after all, i don't hear anyone on the far left saying that [mitt] romney got a hall pass, collins said, referring to the utah gop senator who voted in lockstep with her on the issue of witnesses.
on tuesday, politico reported that the federal government will not reopen health insurance enrollment on the federal healthcare.gov exchange that serves the residents of 38 states. peculiarly, those places are mostly gop-leaning states that declined to create their own health insurance exchanges and that trump won in the 2016 presidential election.
the 13-page application for coverage from the tennessee farm bureau plan, a possible model for kansas, asks 67 questions about personal health care history, covering the last seven years.
what color represents the highest level (hazardous) on the epa's air quality index, is included in the name of a pop music band whose last five studio albums have reached the top 2 on the billboard 200 album chart, and is the name of a student newspaper at the university of chicago? (maroon)
leading legal scholars ― including those who were central to bringing the previous lawsuits against the affordable care act ― think this lawsuit is nonsense.
health care is high on the list of voter concerns for 2020, as last week's democratic candidate debate made clear once again. it's no mystery why. about 28 million americans don't have health insurance, while tens of millions with coverage still struggle to pay their medical bills.
texas' 2nd congressional district: rep. dan crenshaw (r) vs. sima ladjevardian (d)
time to make a decision, gentleman and ladies, byrne said. and this is one of those moments where you've got to say who you are deep inside of you. are you for president trump and repealing and replacing obamacare, or are you against president trump, and you are against repealing and replacing obamacare? it's that simple.
youth turnout typically plummets during midterm election years ― fewer than one-fifth of registered voters between ages 18 and 35 voted in 2014 ― and nextgen has spent heavily to turn them out. some early polling has suggested that young voters are more enthusiastic in 2018 than in a typical midterm year.
mcclellan represented the richmond area for 11 years in the house of delegates and four years in the state senate. she frequently points to the spirit of community service in her family ― a family of educators and community leaders ― as her inspiration.
outside the building, dozens of people gathered to protest macarthur and the health care bill. they carried signs that read, killer tom, health care, not wealth care, and stop twitler now ― a reference to the president and his active twitter account. a group of demonstrators also held a die-in to protest the health care bill. they lay down on the ground and held up mock tombstones while someone dressed as the grim reaper stood over them.
they didn't. it turns out that's not because they didn't have any ideas. it's because their best idea is … crappier health insurance.
the trump administration's move is not without precedent. in 2011, president barack obama's justice department declined to defend the defense of marriage act (doma) in court. critics at the time warned that failing to defend an existing law might set a bad precedent, and some of obama's own advisers opposed the decision.
it's not like the democrats, pro-choice advocates, and everyday voters who support a woman's right to choose will feel any better or protest any less merely because a conservative female justice helped overturn roe v. wade.
the question now is whether he'll get away with it.
gaffigan also revealed that he found a lot of bots in his replies, that even trump's ridiculous talking points work on his supporters and that many people believe the qanon conspiracy theory.
another criticism leveled at the ministries is the limited services.
affordable care act supporters have spent $13,950,400 on pro-obamacare ads this cycle (through june 30), just more than the $13,441,570 spent on anti-obamacare ads.
the aspiring lawyer talks politics with the shrewdness of a veteran washington insider and with a passion she attributes to her father, who made her watch the news at a young age. i would have to watch '60 minutes' and things like that and then it just got interesting to me, she said, explaining that she kept up with former republican presidential candidate herman cain's alleged sexual assault scandal in 2011 as a kid. so i've been in this game for a little bit.
republicans could still make gains. democrats could misstep, either in their treatment of barrett or in the procedural roadblocks they are deploying to slow down her confirmation. or barrett's performances in judiciary committee hearings could turn into cash windfalls.
republicans refused to give president barack obama's supreme court pick, merrick garland, a hearing or a vote in early 2016, insisting that voters deserved to weigh in before filling a seat to the court.
sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), a vulnerable red-state democrat up for re-election this year, in a state where trump is overwhelmingly popular and many residents rely on obamacare's pre-existing condition protections, said he's planning to question kavanaugh on whether he believes obamacare is constitutional.
as recently as april 19 (coincidentally the date of the new york election), bernie sanders tweeted, on sunday, i visited brownsville. i came away more determined than ever to address the affordable housing crisis.
that has led some republicans, including trump himself, to suggest in recent days that perhaps the law could collapse on its own, and then democrats would have to come up with a solution.
q: that's why sanders and warren and the rest talk about going after insurers and drugmakers. what's wrong with that?
neil j. young is a historian and author of we gather together: the religious right and the problem of interfaith politics. he hosts the history podcast past present.
republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal obamacare since its 2010 passage. the justice department would normally defend a federal law, but the trump administration has declined to take that position against a challenge by 18 republican-led states.
whatever their rationale, they are making their feelings known and, in the process, supplying conservative judges with arguments that can stop the lawsuit in its tracks.
the president is exempt from conflicts of interest, chaffetz said. he is exempt. that's the law. and democrats are flailing and that's about all they have at this point.
he hasn't had a real challenger in a decade, barzee flores said of the incumbent congressman in an interview recently aired on siriusxmprogress. he is for the first time having to answer for his atrocious voting record. he voted to repeal, without replacement, the affordable care act 18 times. nearly 300,000 people in the district he allegedly represents would have lost access to health care when you include people with pre-existing conditions.
most mainstream legal scholars, even conservative ones, consider the lawsuit thin. but republican-appointed judges in texas and on the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals have advanced its arguments to the supreme court, and barrett has been critical of the health care law in the past.
trump took over his father's real estate business in 1974, when it was worth $200 million, a figure that inflates to over $1 billion in current dollars – meaning that the billionaire status he so frequently brags about actually came about thanks to his birth.
washington — it's easy to write off former vice president joe biden's comment this week — predicting republicans would have an epiphany and embrace bipartisanship after president donald trump leaves office — as a simple gaffe or as a way to signal to moderate voters that he, too, cares about the nation's precious norms.
ben hasty/getty images food banks, such as the one pictured here in cumru, pennsylvania, have experienced unprecedented demand since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
associated press robert mueller at his press conference in may.
it's a problem that already exists in some states, like iowa and tennessee, but it could get worse and affect even more americans if the trump administration regulations go into effect, especially if the new measures cause more insurers to abandon markets altogether.
but trump spent far more time being, well, the guy we've seen since day one of his campaign. he belittled the protesters who interrupted him at regular intervals, boasted about his crowd sizes (far bigger than bernie's, by the way), and, of course, made particular pains to try to emasculate lyin' ted cruz.
prescription medications in the u.s. are more expensive — frequently a lot pricier than in other countries. people without insurance can't afford them, while even those with coverage frequently owe so much in out-of-pocket costs in the form of copays and deductibles, that they can't pay for their drugs, either.
your campaign is essentially fighting with him now in a way that is casting aspersions on his character, calling him dishonest, maddow said to clinton.
then there's moulton's big-dollar fundraising model. it's hard to believe that he is not at least a little bit ideologically constrained by his donor base.
the whole repeal-and-replace gambit relies on getting republicans with competing interests on board, even if it's not in their constituents' interests, with the distant promise that leaders can come up with something better. the emerging line from republicans is that people who currently get nearly free health care under the medicaid expansion will like having more options for insurance.
there was something for everyone -- as long as you weren't advocating for multiculturalism, inclusiveness and any of that other namby-pamby stuff.
we've got so many people crossing over. i think we can end up being a blue state like virginia, breedlove said monday as she waited to hear harrison speak in columbia.
asked on wednesday what republicans would do if they couldn't pass their bill, gop conference chairman john thune (r-s.d.) suggested republicans didn't have a backup plan.
trump jr. has this month alone caught heat on the social media platform for repeating his father's lie about the number of people who attended former democratic rep. beto o'rourke's rally in texas and insulting loser teachers.
murkowski, 61, chuckled when asked if it sounded appealing to ditch her party. she said the reality is there are only two parties in congress ― the senate's two independents caucus with democrats ― and she has no interest in joining democrats.
richard north patterson is the new york times best-selling author of 22 novels and a member of the council on foreign relations. he is a contributor to the new book fight for liberty – defending democracy in the age of trump.
recent years have seen increasing corporatization and consolidation throughout the medical-industrial complex, including among insurers, the drug industry, hospital systems, nursing homes, and dialysis centers. as their market shares grow, they have more latitude to set prices to what the traffic will bear.
based on previous projections, the number of newly insured californians plus those getting new state assistance could easily exceed 1 million, according to several analysts that huffpost contacted.
booker has not relented on kavanaugh's position on racial diversity, profiling and targeted policing. the senator pressed kavanaugh on his position on voting rights, citing a case from south carolina in which the judge ruled in favor of a voter identification law despite evidence of the law's discriminating effect. booker called such laws a modern-day poll tax.
like other moderates including sen. michael bennet (colo.), biden insisted he supported universal coverage even while opposing sanders' medicare for all plan, and suggested another path.
as for the idea that removing regulations will allow people to tailor benefits to their liking, that overlooks the fact that people frequently have no idea what medical problems they will have in the future ― and that, in an unregulated insurance market, even insurers that want to cover services like mental health or maternity would find it too costly, because doing so would attract disproportionate numbers of people who need the coverage.
washington ― hours after opening debate on a republican health care bill, the senate roundly rejected the first of a series of gop proposals late tuesday night: the obamacare repeal and replacement plan that republicans had been working on for months.
with snyder on his way out of office last year, because of term limits, and the gop's hold on that position in clear jeopardy, the legislature passed (and snyder eventually signed) legislation creating the work requirements. that legislation included a trigger provision that would have rolled back the expansion altogether if the federal government didn't give approval, which it did pending confirmation and a few minor modifications from the state.
in unveiling his bill, sanders (who co-sponsored warren's bill as well) was simply introducing a new variation on an idea he has touted for years and, famously, made the centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. but it was the first time he got support from so many of his colleagues, including, conspicuously, pretty much every democratic senator thinking about a white house bid in 2020.
the obama administration had arranged for the ads, and paid for them, before leaving office. a senior hhs communications adviser, who declined to give his name, said the trump administration decided to stop the advertising for the sake of efficiency, and to save on the $5 million that the campaign would have cost.
daniel greenwald, who manages the restaurants, said he did not know the full extent of the labor department's findings until huffpost shared them. he suggested employees made up the allegations. he also said the restaurant fired a manager at the time believed to be responsible for any violations. it's in the past, it's settled… we've definitely moved on, greenwald said.
but, berwick also said, the same feature ... maintains the inefficiencies of private insurance and a multi-payer system, with its inherent complexities.
i don't feel like i've changed, the activist, trey ward, says in the ad. i didn't leave lindsey graham; he left me.
one is that the affordable care act survives without much fuss, the program goes on as it is, and nobody loses coverage. this lawsuit is so weak that even conservative legal experts who supported previous challenges think it has no basis. several or all conservative justices might join liberals in rejecting it.
at first, management told her she would have to pump in the store's fitting rooms, but there was no outlet for her to plug in her electric pump. she asked if she could use an extension cord and was told it would be a tripping hazard.
a victory for harrison on tuesday would make history for south carolina. it would become the first state in u.s. history to have two black u.s. senators, an especially noteworthy distinction for a former slave state that was first to declare secession from the union during the civil war. (sen. tim scott is the first african american to be a u.s. senator from south carolina; the republican has said his 2022 reelection bid will be his last.)
officials at samaritan ministries told healthline their membership has jumped from 22,000 households in 2013 to its current 62,000 level.
he successfully sued the clinic and got the $600 back, but he refuses to turn the money over the lab: i told them to fuck off.
should private insurance have any role at all?
why people who hate obamacare love ministries
appearing on fox news, sen. john kennedy (r-la.) said that anyone worried about barrett voting to strike down the law if she is confirmed, which looks all but certain prior to the nov. 3 election, should put down the bong.
washington ― as republicans stake out positions on what an obamacare repeal needs to look like to secure their vote, one popular component of the 2010 health care law is threatening to sink the gop's entire repeal effort: the medicaid expansion.
most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. yougov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. if these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.
she is now on food stamps and talking to bankruptcy lawyers. a bank began foreclosure proceedings in august on the blacksburg house she shared with her family. the home will be sold to pay off the mortgage.
as for the final outcome, the high court has already rejected two challenges to the 2010 health care law, with chief justice john roberts joining the court's four democratic appointees each time. the chances of this latest, less legally plausible lawsuit prevailing would seem to be pretty small, though it could depend in part on whether all five of the justices who upheld the affordable care act previously are still on the bench.
like any political spat, the standoff between democratic leaders and their new colleagues is multifaceted. it is in part informed by ideological differences: house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and rep. ilhan omar (d-minn.) really don't agree on american foreign policy with respect to israel, for example. it's also partly generational: the old guard is simply not quite gelling with the new wave.
michigan has been an innovative state for a long time, j. mario molina, physician and ceo of the eponymous insurance company, told huffpost. in some states, it's just ... let's churn through patients, see how much money we can make. this state, it's more sophisticated ― for example, when it comes to working on quality. doctors understand that part of their compensation will depend on whether they provide quality of care, not just lots of care.
ends obamacare taxes. taxes to finance the affordable care act's expansion, including new payroll taxes on the wealthiest americans and taxes on health care companies and tanning salons, would expire.
trump has backtracked somewhat from his earlier calls for republicans to begin working on health care now. with the house under democratic control, he tweeted tuesday that republicans could wait until after the 2020 elections to get going on health care again.
since taking office, the trump administration has attempted to weaken the aca law in other ways ― by, for example, cutting funds for organizations that help people enroll for coverage under obamacare. and although the republicans and trump have not yet succeeded in their oft-declared goal of repealing the law outright, they did pass legislation ending the individual mandate penalty ― the fine for those who don't have insurance that was designed to spur people to get coverage.
california's existing program, started more than a decade ago, is relatively cheap. workers in the state pay a 1 percent payroll tax on wages of up $115,000 to fund the program. and the fund is currently running a surplus, newsom said thursday. one way to pay for an expansion would be to tap into that surplus. he also mentioned raising the payroll tax as an option or raising the income limit so those earning more than the current taxable ceiling would contribute more.
when carrier announced it would shutter its indianapolis furnace plant in 2016, and lay off more than 1,400 employees, trump seized on the news as an example of how free trade screws american workers. he vowed that if he won the presidency, american companies would no longer shift production to countries with cheaper workers.
not basing everything on personality but on his performance, his wife lisa said in agreement.
my medical school was appalled and swiftly reinstated my active-student status. however, the damage had been done: now the insurance company insisted i had a preexisting disease and my care was suddenly substantially more expensive. furthermore, i was told i had exceeded the maximum annual coverage for my insurance (the so-called cap on care). it was only february.
the subject that day was medicare for all, a universal coverage proposal that envisions a single government program paying the health bills for every american. at the april 2019 hearing, barkan offered both a statistical and a personal brief for the idea, describing fights with private insurance companies, ongoing anxiety over high out-of-pocket medical bills and the toll those struggles had taken on his family.
clinton's recent domestic policy offensive fails on both fronts. nobody really believes that a woman who served on the board of walmart when her husband was governor of arkansas and who made millions of dollars giving speeches to big banks and private equity firms is a populist democrat. and nobody really believes that a woman who previously advocated a medicare-for-all plan thinks single-payer will destroy medicare. party activists also don't believe that her incrementalism is more legislatively plausible, because no actual democratic efforts are going to be possible for years to come.
if they don't hear passion and change, you're going to see donald trump get four more years, he said. let's be the party of working people again.
the lower-polling candidates, including sen. kamala harris (d-calif.), sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) and former rep. beto o'rourke (d-texas), all deployed different strategies for a breakout moment: klobuchar used her corny sense of humor, harris tried to focus on criticizing president donald trump, and o'rourke had success introducing his campaign's new focus on gun control to a national audience.
like liberal activists mobilizing around the country on a variety of issues, taking action is making these idaho volunteers feel less alone and more empowered.
it wouldn't be in keeping with conservative philosophy, but that hasn't stopped trump before. besides, if you look at the actual details of what speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) wants to replace medicare with, it looks a lot like the affordable care act. they could all take some form of spiteful pride in essentially stealing obama's landmark legislation from him ― which, i suppose, is fair turnabout, since democrats originally stole it from the heritage foundation and mitt romney. you shouldn't discount the extent to which animosity inside the beltway is solely driven by who ends up getting to take credit for what.
gaffigan, known as a clean comic, even dropped some choice four-letter words.
but ginsburg was a vote to uphold the law both times. without her, things become a lot more complicated. for starters, because it's not clear how many justices will even be on the court for the hearing.
other parts of arizona, including adjacent areas of the phoenix metropolitan area, have been trending more democratic. clinton lost the state by just 3.5 percentage points, and in maricopa county, which encompasses greater phoenix, voters ousted joe arpaio, the notoriously anti-immigrant sheriff.
trump could continue along the path the irs started by making clear to the public that his administration won't penalize people who don't get health coverage.
democrat hiral tipirneni, 50, a physician and an advocate for cancer research, is taking on republican debbie lesko, 59, a conservative state senator, to fill a suburban phoenix seat vacated by rep. trent franks (r). franks resigned in december after it emerged that he had offered a female aide $5 million to serve as a surrogate mother for his children.
i can kind of see how some people feel as if our votes don't count, but it's still important that we do vote, he said. i understand that my vote is important and that if i don't vote, i can't really complain when things aren't the way that i like it.
more to the point for trump's florida audience, he spoke directly to seniors who have increasingly soured on his handling of the pandemic.
last month, the justice department threw its support behind a lawsuit arguing that obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional.
in missouri's 1st congressional district, cori bush is challenging longtime rep. william lacy clay. bush is backed by brand new congress, the same group that helped propel ocasio-cortez to victory. bush was one of the first people ocasio-cortez thanked after she won, and ocasio-cortez has stumped for her friend in missouri.
trump's wife isn't the only one who's been giving him that advice.
in that 2012 decision, chief justice john roberts, writing for a 5-4 majority, said the mandate was a valid exercise of congressional authority to levy taxes. but the 2017 republican tax bill, which trump signed into law, reduced the penalty to zero while leaving the rest of the mandate's legislative language in the statute.
but not all insurers will be unhappy if these new regulations are finalized. unitedhealth, which dropped out of ahip a few years ago, already sells such policies. in an earnings call in october, the company's chief executive said the opportunity to sell more of them ― along with so-called association health plans, which allow small businesses to buy policies that are also exempt from some of the affordable care act's regulations ― would be a profit opportunity.
these findings are consistent with the financial losses reported by companies including unitedhealth group, anthem, aetna and health care service corp. on their exchange business. unitedhealth group has publicly weighed pulling out of these marketplaces, and several insurers have cut or halted fees to insurance brokers who send them new customers as a way to reduce their exposure.
repealing the affordable care act was a core promise of his 2016 presidential campaign and although efforts to pass repeal legislation failed (just barely), trump has taken a number of budgetary and regulatory actions to further undermine the law.
getting picked up at the airport and squeezing into the mid-2000s sedan driven by your district scheduler
kevin counihan, who was chief executive officer for healthcare.gov and before that managed the state exchange in connecticut, warned that halting outreach now could undermine the program in the future.
planned parenthood is suing president donald trump's administration in court to block this gag rule, which allows title x recipients to still talk about abortion with their patients, but prohibits them from giving people information about where to get an abortion, such as the name of a provider or the location of a clinic.
fellow california democrat rep. ro khanna was also emphatic that coronavirus was a case study in why medicare for all is important.
those are both relatively modest cuts. the administration argues the ssdi cut isn't really a social security reduction: white house budget documents omit the disability program's name, describing ssdi as a federal disability program. and the medicare cut would be imperceptible to many older americans because doctors and hospitals might bear the brunt of it.
the trump administration's new medicaid funding plan is based on the same principles as those previous versions.
cuomo was initially supportive of the bill but became more hesitant after it passed the state assembly. he raised concerns about the possibility of immigration enforcement agencies using dmv information to track down undocumented immigrants. ultimately, once the state attorney general said the bill's safeguards would prevent it from being weaponized against undocumented people, cuomo signed the measure into law.
there are key opportunities with veterans choice and it is in high demand among veterans.
the president's take may be more nuanced than that of mr. trump, but that's more about trump than anything else. in a nutshell, the obama argument is this: although we've got more work to do to improve opportunity and increase justice for all americans, we have made real progress, we're moving in the right direction, and we are significantly better off than we were in the past.
exchange shoppers should be prepared for long hold times on the customer service lines and should seek help from local enrollment counselors, pollitz advised. trump's large cuts to enrollment assistance likely will make it difficult to schedule help, so people should try more than one counseling organization, she said.
all of this, by the way, is in addition to a lawsuit making its way through the federal courts that seeks to invalidate the entire aca over changes to a financial penalty. despite a favorable ruling from a conservative judge in texas and backing from the trump administration, the lawsuit is so weak that even longtime critics of obamacare think it's baseless. few expect it to advance, but the possibility remains.
former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton tweeted her opposition to kavanaugh on wednesday morning, arguing he would of course work to gut or overturn roe v. wade.
democrats tried to slow the confirmation process by forcing procedural votes and a rare closed session on friday, but republicans quickly defeated their efforts with 51 gop votes. they argued there's nothing illegitimate in filling a supreme court seat so close to a presidential election when the same party controls both the white house and senate.
unfortunately, we only reserved the room at the aurora central library for 90 minutes, which is usually plenty of time to see everyone, he said. for those who were unable to see the congressman today, we apologize.
i don't think [the investment fund] has anything to do with my role as a board member of the united states of care. i suspect every board member and every participant is going to have their own set of activities. i happen to have a core belief that we need to refocus investment in underserved communities. and i've walked my talk, by the way, for a number of years, so you can take a look back at my track record.
biden's rejection of medicare for all could reflect any number of factors, including a substantive preference for keeping a mix of private and public insurance. but one former obama administration official thinks at least part of the explanation is that biden tempers his enthusiasm for universal coverage with an acute sense of what's not achievable in health care reform.
as long as the affordable care act remains on the books, millions of low- and middle-income individuals will continue to get comprehensive, subsidized insurance they wouldn't have otherwise ― and, most likely, have better access to care as a result. that's especially true in states where leaders are more enthusiastic about making the program work.
the judges sounded like they lived in fantasyland
not surprisingly, the uninsured group was most likely to skip medications (including but not limited to insulin and other diabetes therapies). among non-elderly adults with no health coverage, 35.7% reported not filling a prescription because they didn't have the money.
in a major win for the democratic party's progressive wing, marie newman defeated democratic rep. dan lipinski in tuesday's primary in illinois, according to the associated press, toppling one of the last remaining opponents of abortion rights among house democrats.
creating a single-payer plan where the wealthy pay more and everyone else comes out no worse or ahead would require a delicate balance of high tax rates for the wealthy that do not cause substantial tax avoidance and moderate to low tax rates for everyone else, jodi liu, chief author of the rand report, told huffpost. the overall tax revenue needed would depend critically on how much providers are paid.
i applaud the administration for its action today, and i look forward to the finalization of the proposed rule, paul said on thursday. conservative health care reform is alive and well, and i will keep working with president trump to build on this progress.
the conservative argument for a feminist barrett seems to center around the fact that she is a mother of many children who still managed to succeed. she is a walking example of how young children and demanding work can coexist—i dare suggest even happily, writes wall street journal opinion writer kate bachelder odell in a piece calling barrett a role model for mothers.
in her book a fighting chance warren repeatedly recalls the forces the big banks were able to marshall against her and the other democrats fighting for bankruptcy reform and the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau, noting the staffers and lobbyists and lawyers for the megabanks outnumbered [financial reform advocates] by a zillion to one. one of the chapters of the book is titled what a million dollars a day can buy, referring to the amount banks spent fighting the dodd-frank financial reform law.
but the new rules are arguably more notable for what they don't address: subsidies for so-called cost-sharing reductions, which are paid to insurers covering the poorest enrollees. trump has threatened to cut off those payments and send the markets into a tailspin in an unorthodox bid to pressure democrats into supporting his plan to repeal the affordable care act.
people say 'i don't know what medicare for all is about,' sen. john barrasso, a wyoming republican who happens to be a physician, told huffpost. well as a doctor, i can tell you. it means longer lines and waiting times to get to see a doctor. it means higher taxes. it means fewer choices, less freedom.
but now, on the eve of the state's first major election since they lost everything, kentucky democrats claim that this state, where they've won 10 of the last 12 governor's races dating back to 1971, isn't totally red yet. limited pre-race polling for tuesday's governor's race has shown the democratic nominee, attorney general andy beshear, at worst tied with gov. matt bevin, the archconservative firebrand who has bullied his way through four years in frankfort.
for example, the congressional budget office originally predicted the law would cover more people. but then the supreme court ruled that states could opt out of the affordable care act's medicaid expansion, leaving millions of poor people in those states uninsured. the cbo also predicted higher enrollment on the health insurance exchanges. but the agency incorrectly assumed ― as republicans constantly warned at the time ― that employers would end job-based health benefits and direct workers to the exchanges instead, which didn't happen.
the washington post via getty images braylen washington waits for a drive-in campaign rally for jaime harrison to begin in north charleston.
the decision to side with the plaintiffs reportedly came directly from the white house, despite trump's repeated campaign vows to protect people with pre-existing conditions, and was controversial even within the justice department. three career attorneys removed their names from the brief indicating the administration's intentions and one of them ended up resigning after more than 20 years as a government lawyer.
for left-leaning economists like scott and spriggs, the only silver lining of trump's presidency is that he has raised the political costs for business-friendly democrats who are tempted to return to the party's past support for pro-corporate policies, such as lopsided international trade agreements and excessive budgetary austerity.
a rebuttal to the free market meme
to get around that rule, mcconnell opted to simply end all senate floor business and adjourn. so kavanaugh's hearing will continue, even as senate floor business will not.
all of it was overblown for an op-ed that still managed to endorse most of the president's policies and praised trump's selection of wingnuts like former attorney general jeff sessions to his administration. but the media response shouldn't be all that surprising given its desperation to celebrate any tiny hint of anti-trump resistance in the republican ranks.
one of our ongoing disagreements has been about the nature of the party, and where you fit within it. with respect to gop extremism in areas like climate denial, gun violence or reproductive rights, you often say, but i'm not like that. but the party is. you may be moderate in your views; the party is not. even candidates with temperate instincts must go along to survive, or meet the fate of jon huntsman, mocked for publicly accepting climate change and evolution.
kevin lamarque / reuters house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) is wondering what this 37-page document is that republicans claim is their obamacare replacement.
associated press teachers from across kentucky gather inside the state capitol to rally against changes to their state-funded pension system, friday, april 13, 2018, in frankfort, ky.
the most glaring example is trump's claim that the order makes protecting people with preexisting conditions the policy of the united states, despite his ongoing attempts to eliminate it and his record of undermining those protections.
warren's problem is clearly as much about electability as it is about policy. alan abramowitz, a political scientist at emory university, wrote last week that house candidates who backed medicare for all in the 2018 midterm elections performed about 5 percentage points worse than candidates who did not, adding ammunition to the centrist argument.
democrats now have their hearts set on special elections in montana and georgia's 6th district. the latter race, to fill a seat vacated by secretary of health and human services tom price, has received significant investment from the dccc and outside groups like daily kos.
a more ambitious policy answer would be the one california is now considering. that state has proposed bolstering the tax credits for insurance buyers so that they are available to more people and provide more assistance to people who get them. if successful, that effort would make the affordable care act look more like many of its architects originally intended, before political pressure to contain the cost of the program forced lawmakers to reduce the assistance that insurance buyers would get.
however, says gillian dean, md, senior director of medical services at planned parenthood, it is not a solution for everyone. that's because it is only used until 10 or 11 weeks, at which point a lot of women don't even know they are pregnant — teens with irregular periods, obese women who don't notice weight gain. it also can't be used by some women with certain underlying medical problems.
but while michigan's insurers are raising rates this year, they aren't freaking out.
president trump's bogus executive order on preexisting conditions isn't worth the paper it's signed on, pelosi said in a statement thursday. it is an insult to every family with someone with a preexisting condition that president trump thinks he can get away with this farce while he races a justice onto the supreme court to strike down the lifesaving protections enshrined into law by the affordable care act.
this year, bishop's issues page has no mention of health care. stu sandler, a campaign consultant for bishop, told the washington post that the new site reflects the congressman's accomplishments and that he hasn't changed his position on obamacare.
medicaid cuts could impact people of all ages and put at risk the health and safety of 17.4 million children and adults with disabilities and seniors by eliminating much needed services that allow individuals to live independently in their homes and communities, leamond said. this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable.
arthur delaney contributed to this report.
this new iteration of medicare for all legislation looks a lot like the previous one, which the independent vermont senator introduced in the fall of 2017. it envisions a government insurance plan that would pay for all medical services with almost no out-of-pocket expenses, making it more comprehensive than either traditional medicare or employer policies.
while the american social safety net has large holes and the health care system is fragmented and confusing, the newly unemployed have several ways to replace employer health benefits.
the end citizens united poll, conducted by global strategy group, was an online survey of more than 1,200 voters in arizona, colorado, florida, georgia, iowa, michigan, north carolina, new hampshire, nevada, ohio, pennsylvania and wisconsin.

on tuesday, barrett declined to characterize the roe v. wade decision that legalized abortion as a super-precedent that must not be overturned.
raul mejia, a prep specialist at callen-lorde, goes further. in addition to how inaccessible prep is, black msm are still black people and as such deal with life-threatening issues such as racism, internalized homophobia, homophobia, hyper-masculinity, violence and police brutality on a daily basis, he says. this needs to be taken into account when attempting to serve this community.
and then last year, trump and the gop congress spent months trying to repeal major parts of the law ― and uninsure 20 million or so people in the process ― but failed. but they eventually were able to deal some damage to the law by repealing the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, which, for practical purposes, eliminated the mandate.
the reason that republican leadership is rushing renewed talk of repeal before the easter recess is because we're edging closer to june 21st, the date when insurers have to both decide whether or not to stay in aca marketplaces and finalize their 2018 plans and rates. while talk alone doesn't determine policy, it certainly signals where it is headed.
associated press sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who is riding high in the 2020 presidential polls, introduced an updated single-payer health care bill in the senate.
our country is in a culture war, and we're warriors in that culture war, boyce said.
macon, ga. (ap) — backed into a corner and facing financial strains, president donald trump went after his opponent's family and defended his own struggle to contain the pandemic as he fought to energize his sagging reelection bid in the nation's sun belt. with election day looming, democrat joe biden pushed to keep voters focused on health care in the midwest.
khn's findings, based on court records, documents and interviews with hospital officials and dozens of patients, show uva:
the protests died down after a few weeks, but they left a lasting effect on the state's politics: ky 120 united, a group that started on facebook to organize the teacher demonstrations, has remained active, and teachers' pledge to legislators that they would remember in november last year has carried over to this election. bevin won a low-turnout race in 2015; this time, he's facing a motivated opposition that he's only bolstered, and not just in places like deep-blue louisville, where teachers staged another round of sickouts and protests this year. (bevin's labor cabinet investigated the teachers who called in sick; the governor blamed teachers for a student getting shot on a day when schools were closed.) he may also have hurt himself in smaller, rural counties, where public schools, health systems and the state government are often the largest employers.
the farm bill, which reauthorizes agricultural subsidies as well as the supplemental nutrition assistance program (i.e., food stamps), passed the house in july with only republican votes. that partisan division was due in large part to the work requirements that republicans have pushed for years. but now, simple math is forcing their hand: republicans need at least nine democrats to get any food stamp legislation through the senate, and so far none of them have signaled support for stricter benefit rules.
sen. bernie sanders (i-v.t.) on wednesday elaborated on his plans to pass a medicare-for-all proposal in a sharply divided congress if he wins the presidency in 2020.
well, the single most startling difference is that americans think about cost and bills and whether they can afford a medical procedure ― and that's just not even in the conversation in other countries. i started this book while living overseas, and i've interacted with many other health care systems. my experience in those other countries has been, for instance, profuse apologies for having to pay $100 for stitches. i remember thinking, you don't even know how lucky i am, because if i had gone into a hospital in new york with this, i'd come out with a $500 copay, and my insurer would be billed thousands of dollars.
the executive order is largely a symbolic effort and ignores the gop's ongoing effort to repeal the aca.
the second part of the answer gets closer to the heart of the issue, which is really the fundamental debate taking place right now. to what extent should the cost of health care fall on those individuals and families who need it, because they have health problems, and to what extent should government require insurers to spread that financial burden as broadly as possible?
i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan. our troops have fought with unmatched valor ― and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.
but others argue republicans were going to do what they were going to do, no matter what official studies showed. i think, generally, the interest of the members of congress pushing for the bill was a tax cut that was fairly regressive, said lily batchelder, a former senate finance committee chief tax counsel and now a tax law professor at new york university. that's what they put forth, and i think that aligned with their views of what's best for the economy.
what the health care debate looked like back then
after a bit of a break in july, candidates and voters are gearing up for the next round of high-stakes races in this year's primary elections.
michael, who is on prep, doesn't mince words when addressing the larger societal context into which prep has arrived. there is something very imperialistic about the way that prep has been rolled out, he says, because you can't get a young man of color to care about whether or not he contracts hiv when he doesn't feel good enough about himself to care about whether or not he lives or dies.
kevin lamarque / reuters president donald trump is lobbying for a health care law introduced by house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.). aarp is trying to stop the legislation.
it's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not, she said.
it's not so different from what trump always promises, except that biden's policies would bring the u.s. closer to that goal and trump's would push it farther away.
pence sat and smiled tensely as trump stole the show. when pence got in a full sentence, his comment on trump was, i believe he'll be a great president of the united states.
as of now, two republicans are duking it out in the primary to face baldwin in november. leah vukmir is a conservative member of the state senate who has won endorsements from powerful wisconsin gop politicians.
anyone that can actually do basic math can understand that their projections for obamacare the last time were way, way off the mark, white house press secretary sean spicer said at wednesday's press briefing. when they come out with this score, we need to understand the track record when it comes to health care.
donald trump spent much of his campaign and early presidency promising insurance for everybody. most republicans have known better, and so they have made the argument that ryan and his allies were repeating over and over again on tuesday.
this is at odds with the latest evidence.
the obama administration did just that. when it wrote the rules for the individual mandate, the administration said that short-term plans would not count as qualifying coverage, which meant that people who had these plans would still have to pay the penalty. the administration also limited these short-term policies to durations of just three months — although that regulation just took effect this year, and some insurers have found ways to sell a year's worth of coverage even with that regulation in force. (basically, they allow customers to buy four plans, each for a duration of three months, at one time.)
these were awkward conversations. we loved tearing through the foibles of our president-elect, and i was a ringleader. but these conversations got me riled up, and i couldn't see any other way to de-stress.
but it's not just insurance rules that would disappear. money would too. today americans who buy insurance on their own can get tax credits if their income is below four times the poverty line (about $100,000 a year for a family of four). those credits effectively discount premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year ― and they would be gone if the affordable care act comes off the books.
mishandling the pandemic isn't enough for trump, biden charged. on top of that he's still trying to take away your health care.
any change in our health care system has to be done pragmatically and incrementally. dr. al gross
the author of that ruling was chief justice john roberts, who joined the four liberals in allowing most of the program to stand. it's a pretty clear sign that, had barrett been on the bench then, she would have voted with the other republican-appointed justices and said obamacare was unconstitutional.
obviously, the ability to frame issues so shrewdly is part of pelosi's power. but she often has such a strong hand because democrats stick together. during the shutdown, there were hardly any democrats demanding that pelosi move away from her original demand that there be no money for a border wall. again, progressives were key in making that the default democratic position, though pelosi also won because she was able to keep every other democrat in line as well.
sanders, in a statement last month, elaborated on his plans. he opened with a quick history lesson: as was the case with workers' rights, the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the gay rights movement and the environmental movement, the only way transformational legislation like medicare for all passes is when millions of people stand up and demand it. and we're making progress in that fight every single day.
but there's a big catch: these unemployed workers must pay the full premium (plus a 2% administrative fee).
wednesday night, sandwiched between harris and sen. cory booker (n.j.), biden seemed more sharp, energetic and prepared. he ably parried broadsides from both rivals and dished out fire of his own on other candidates on stage, who lobbed repeated attacks on the former vice president over his support for the 1994 crime bill, his health care plan, immigration and his record on women's rights.
mike blake / reuters tom steyer's nextgen group is putting $4 million into digital ads that aim to increase youth turnout.
but other states have different ideas. although california's democrats are breaking ground by passing laws that add substantial new financial assistance and cover (some) undocumented adults through medicaid, their counterparts in more liberal states like maryland, new mexico and washington are enacting state-level versions of the regulations that the trump administration has taken away and contemplating or other initiatives, like automatic insurance enrollment, that are likely to improve access to care.
on the republican side, sens. mike lee (utah) and rand paul (ky.) also voted against it.
over the last four years in washington, graham has latched himself to an unpopular president he once derided as racist and unfit for office ― one who tramples on the type of inclusive and moderate politics had proudly touted for years. now, he's running as trump's top apostle in congress who always has the president's back and who isn't afraid to scream a little to get things done.
canova is running for the seat held by former democratic national committee chair rep. debbie wasserman schulz.
advanceable, refundable tax credits: the bill includes an advanceable, refundable tax credit for individuals without access to health insurance for the purchase of health insurance beginning in 2020. these credits vary based on age, with older individuals receiving more generous credits than younger. credits would be: $2,000 for individuals under 30; $2,500 for individuals 30-40; $3,000 for individuals 40-50; $3,500 for individuals 50-60; and, $4,000 for individuals over 60. there would be an aggregate cap for a family of $14,000 and no more than 5 family members would be eligible for a credit.

in addition to curbing the influence of pharmacy benefit managers, he is running on creating a nationwide public health insurance option that would allow individuals and small businesses to buy into medicare at cost.
restaurants made up more than 10% of the cases, including small eateries and large chains like mcdonald's, subway, olive garden, cracker barrel and buffalo wild wings. an outback steakhouse was cited in 2017 for failing to provide a worker with a space safe from the view of co-workers. the investigator found that the restaurant's parent company, bloomin' brands, did not have a clear corporate-wide policy for pumping at work, even after the law had been in place for roughly seven years. the company did not respond when asked if that had changed.

automatic federal budget cuts beginning in 2013 (known as sequestration) reduced medicare reimbursements, which are a particularly important source of revenue for hospitals. congress has cut back on the amount hospitals can deduct for bad debt. congress, in its budget tightening, reduced other forms of assistance to rural hospitals as well.
no one would think that a little eyeball can put so much stress, financial strain on a family, said josephson, 47. if the affordable care act had never happened and the insurance could exclude us for the rest of our lives about his eye, we never would've been able to do this vision therapy because we couldn't afford that on top of the regular doctor bills that we were paying.

how did this happen? start with the relationship between the party establishment and its base. your family, and mine, occupy a privileged slice of american society. not so for most members of the gop electorate. they are folks that few of us know very well: evangelicals; modestly educated whites threatened by economic dislocation; and people whose distrust of government partakes of paranoia.
to beat mcconnell in november, mcgrath must rack up huge margins in jefferson and fayette counties, where louisville and lexington, respectively, are home to the state's largest bases of reliable democratic voters. booker also won warren county, a western kentucky area that has begun to trend toward democrats.
a former adviser for fossil fuel moguls charles and david koch, jorjani has served as interior's principal deputy solicitor since may 2017 and was officially tapped last month for the solicitor post. the new role includes managing the agency's ethics office, which has come under increased scrutiny after the department's office of inspector general announced a pair of ethics probes into multiple high-ranking agency officials, including newly confirmed secretary david bernhardt.
a lot of people hate obamacare.
he was dynamic, handsome, had pushed his way up from a working-class life to become a harvard-trained lawyer. he had been a community organizer, and the very fact that he was half-white and half-black meant that right in his blood was the ability to speak to a range of people, to be a unifier, as manifested in this, his first national speech.
all across the country, party meetings that had once been sleepy affairs, dominated by robert's rules of order and a handful of graying activists, have become standing room only. the overflowing crowds have sent stunned party regulars scrambling to find new venues, while the surge in interest, and the coinciding fundraising boost, is enabling local chapters to hire staff and build infrastructure in previously unthinkable ways. on the national level, democratic politicians have been rushing to respond to the sudden outpouring.
democrats also began airing ads linking the nomination to the health care fight. a supreme court controlled by donald trump could overturn the affordable care act by the end of this year, a narrator warns in a new ad from the democratic congressional campaign committee in the election for the gop-held seat in southern illinois' 13th congressional district. rodney davis won't help us. he votes with trump.
the strategies for both parties are fairly obvious: democrats, led by presidential nominee joe biden, plan to relentlessly spotlight barrett's views against obamacare and argue she is part of a republican plan to kill protections for people with preexisting conditions. republicans intend to engage in pure power politics and will attempt to bait democrats into attacking the religion or lifestyle of barrett, a 48-year-old mother of seven and former law professor at notre dame.
by insurance status. six years after the passage of the aca, we still have almost 30 million uninsured. among the uninsured, tens of thousands die each year because of lack of health insurance. (3) there are also tens of millions of underinsured without access to necessary care.
breitbart news' most critical coverage of ryan has come from matthew boyle, the chief washington correspondent who long championed trump's candidacy and recently scored an oval office interview.
we see a lot of them, said tina merritt, a partner with true north title in blacksburg. and a lot of people don't even know until they go to sell the property.
the same, he added, is true for other local officials he's talked to recently.
but the debate in the democratic party isn't simply about whether health care reform should require wiping out private insurance. it's about whether the economic agenda should include some kind of job guarantee or a universal child allowance, whether government should guarantee access to high-quality child care, and whether the crisis of global warming requires something with the ambition of a green new deal. behind each of these proposals are layers of substantive and strategic questions, among them whether to pursue bipartisan reform, even if that means settling for less sweeping measures, or whether to assume gop intransigence and focus on maximizing what democrats can accomplish on their own.
critics, however, say the ministries are unregulated, don't guarantee claims will be paid, and could hurt the overall healthcare industry by pulling a segment of the country out of the insurance market.
but i do believe that we need to get a force multiplier if we are going to change the equation in this country. i personally am very excited by all of the energy on this topic. i want to digest it and understand it all and figure out how to turn that into real victories.
but trump has responded to the reduced access by adopting a lighter work schedule – one that typically does not start until 11 a.m. and ends by 6 or 6:30 p.m. that has left plenty of time to watch cable television coverage about himself and then react to it in off-the-cuff remarks to the press and, more famously, brief statements he releases on twitter.
single-payer medicare for all-style plans seek to replace every current form of health coverage ― both private insurance and public programs like medicaid and medicare ― with a sole government-run system that would pay everyone's medical bills and be financed by taxes. by contrast, biden aims to preserve most of the existing health care infrastructure, including the job-based health plans that cover the majority of working-age americans.
medication abortion changes many things but not everything, perritt says.
but there's one less-discussed topic that these democrats think could be a massive political liability for trump and republicans: the president's latest budget request.
the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid to adults earning just above poverty wages has been very effective at expanding coverage to low-income people, but a 2012 supreme court ruling made this policy optional for states, and 14 states have refused to participate. biden proposes allowing people in those non-expansion states to sign up for the new public option plan at no cost.
health care represents more than one-sixth of the economy and, every day, millions struggle with medical bills in ways that cause real harm. democratic candidates are right to argue about the best way of addressing those problems and democratic voters are right to take those differences seriously.
this was just before a video celebrating biden's longtime friendship with the late republican sen. john mccain. the video described mccain as joe's friend who saved obamacare, referring to his pivotal 2017 vote against repealing the affordable care act after earlier votes to repeal.
14 million is 35 times the number of people buried in arlington national cemetery, the nation's second largest cemetery; see photo below. (some unfortunate people will lose their lives due not to untreatable conditions but rather to lack of health insurance.)
there's no shortage of well-crafted ideas for reducing the price of drugs and making sure people have insurance with enough coverage to pay for them. but turning any of these ideas into policy would require defeating the power of health care lobbyists, winning over or overcoming conservatives, and convincing voters that the change would be worthwhile.
tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate ― it is cruel. one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.

other outside groups have been more eager to jump in on gross' behalf. the lincoln project, a super pac run by anti-trump republicans; 314 action fund, which tries to elect democrats with a scientific professional background; and independent alaska, a new super pac of unknown origins, have together spent about $3 million boosting gross and attacking sullivan.
meanwhile, the number of people without health insurance will go up by several million, according to the urban study. the actual number depends on how you define insurance.
instead, new lines of contrast were few and far between, with all three top candidates opting to take a rain check on a climactic battle. sanders and warren teamed up to battle biden in an occasionally testy health care exchange that mostly was a retread of arguments from earlier debates. repeat viewers who were sold on sanders' medicare for all plan and those who prefer biden's more incremental push to expand obamacare were unlikely to have heard any arguments to budge them.
supporters of these plans say they are more affordable, provide more choice, and are more personal as opposed to corporate.

here are some of the biggest changes that would take place if something like the house gop draft bill were to become law:
the legislature balked at that but advocates for immigrants and more health care access have said they will keep pushing, just as they intend to keep pushing for other reforms ― including, for example, regulating the prices of hospitals.
tom williams via getty images senate democrats led by majority leader chuck schumer are pressing ahead with so-called budget reconciliation that will allow them to pass their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package with a bare majority.
a small group of protesters just outside the arena chanting, black lives matter was drowned out by the louder retorts that came from the pro-trump faithful, which included one man who demanded to know why the agitators didn't all just move to syria, if they loved muslims so much. for these efforts, he was rewarded with a boisterous round of cheers and high-fives from the people standing in line next to him.
but such a statement preserves health care as a political issue, and a lawsuit making its way through the courts adds urgency. voters are likely to know exactly what's at stake in november 2020.
multiple candidates accused each other of lying, made misleading statements, or ignored criticism of their plans and records. neither of the two front-runners onstage, former vice president joe biden and sen. kamala harris (d-calif.), made particularly coherent arguments for their proposals.

engelhardt, whom trump elevated to the circuit court last year, wasn't trying to make an argument in favor of the plaintiffs. but in raising the issue of reconciliation, he inadvertently did ― making clear that, by issuing a decision against the affordable care act, courts would be accomplishing for republicans what they could not (and still cannot) accomplish through congress. this is precisely the kind of legislating that the courts are not supposed to do and that republicans have spent so many years decrying as a matter of principle.
biden's proposal, which he put forward two weeks ago, would create a new government-run insurance plan but make enrollment in the plan optional, leaving in place most existing insurance arrangements. he is among the many democrats wary of medicare for all, because, they say, it would be too disruptive and too difficult to enact politically.
the affordable care act expanded health insurance coverage to more than 20 million americans who had previously been uninsured. a full repeal of the law would leave those people uninsured again.
ultimately, that could be ryan's true legacy: tethering his party to an extreme, deeply conservative agenda that the public rejects, starting with the november midterm elections.
but the guidance gives states leeway to rewrite the rules of their insurance markets by allowing the sale of policies that don't include the law's pre-existing protections ― and then letting people use federal tax credits to buy them.
healthcare advocacy groups, however, question whether the administration is trying to prevent people from signing up for obamacare, officially known as the affordable care act. since the aca passage in 2010, republicans have repeatedly tried — and failed — to repeal it, and have plotted to sabotage it with administrative schemes.
attacking the nation's first black president raised trump's profile in the republican party a decade ago, when he became the most prominent birther to spread the lie that obama had not been born in the united states and therefore was an illegitimate president.
the charade may have reached peak absurdity over the last week and a half, when two of the gop officials most famous for their hostility to obamacare, florida gov. rick scott and texas sen. ted cruz, were among those vowing to help people with pre-existing conditions. scott, now running for the senate, first got into politics by fighting the affordable care act. cruz, who's busy defending his seat, once led a shutdown of the federal government in an effort to defund the program.
i ask the men and women of this congress: look at the opportunities before us! our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. our most exciting journeys still await. our biggest victories are still to come. we have not yet begun to dream.
right, i remember how democrats couldn't pass obamacare for two years despite holding congress and the white house, and then obama campaigned hard on it in 2010 and the dems lost big again, and so he declared a national emergency to get it done.
by comparison, kentucky's total medicaid enrollment ― including kids on the children's health insurance program ― is about 1.25 million right now, according to official statistics.
when donald trump took the stage in cleveland to accept the 2016 republican presidential nomination, he sounded different from the party's traditional, business-friendly standard-bearers.
and maybe that's not surprising, given the controversy and tumult that has surrounded the law ever since it was proposed.
these efforts have gotten even more intense since trump took office. his administration has pulled funds for enrollment outreach and proposed regulatory changes that, experts say, will undermine guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions. late last year, republicans passed ― and trump signed ― a tax bill that eliminates the penalty for people who don't buy insurance.
but these are cuts nonetheless. and even in a highly partisan era in which news stories come and go in a matter of hours, vulnerable democrats think trump's budget could have real staying power in the campaign.

elsewhere on capitol hill, vice president-elect mike pence gathered with republican lawmakers to press the opposite case.
during the proceedings, collins made headlines for taking jabs at the democratic house impeachment managers. she chided rep. jerry nadler (d-n.y.) for accusing the senate of engaging in a cover-up by blocking witnesses, sending supreme court chief justice john roberts a note that resulted in an admonishment of both nadler and white house counsel pat cipollone. and when rep. adam schiff (d-calif.) mentioned during his arguments a cbs news report that the white house threatened to punish gop senators who voted against trump, collins shook her head and said, not true.
the department of education under president donald trump wants to roll back civil rights protections for college students who've been sexually assaulted or harassed. women are still paid less than men to do the same jobs, and the gap is even larger for black and hispanic women.
here again, it doesn't take legal expertise to spot the biggest problem with this logic. whatever congress did or didn't think when it passed the affordable care act in 2010, it opted in 2017 to get rid of the mandate while allowing the rest of the law to stand.
correction: a previous version of this article misidentified judge john bates as andrew bates.
when he stood up at the dnc, khizr khan probably had no idea of the impact his simple gesture would have. he knew that he'd be subject to scrutiny and hate by some. he probably knew he'd tug on a few heart strings. but what he couldn't foresee was that his simple yet emotionally charged gesture would shape the 2016 presidential election in a symbolic way.
both welker and trump pressed biden on why, if immigration reform is so important to him, he and then-president barack obama had not succeeded in passing it.
bowe, who said he backed trump because the democrats didn't have a good candidate, chuckled when asked how he thinks the president is doing.
we have a lot of candidates this year. so it's a little overwhelming. mykel king, 19 your browser does not support the audio element.
but the law's regulations have also pushed up premiums, because insurers are suddenly paying for more medical services. and, although the affordable care act's tax credits offset those higher premiums, many people still have ended up paying more than they did previously ― or more than they feel they can afford.
simply put, walls work and walls save lives. so let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make america safe.
the insurance wasn't perfect. even with the subsidy, blitz could only afford a mid-level silver plan, which came with a $2,500 annual deductible. he also ran into glitches with the federal health insurance exchange and almost lost his subsidy.
amanda voisard / reuters robert kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response (aspr) at the u.s. department of health & human services (hhs), and robert r. redfield, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, take part in a house energy and commerce health subcommittee hearing on health and human services oversight of the coronavirus outbreak on feb. 26, 2020.
i was happy to have obamacare before i went on medicare. my insurance through the aca was honestly the best insurance i had. — glenda pollock (@glenda_pollock) june 28, 2020
hatch then called the affordable care act the stupidest, dumbass bill that i've ever seen.
the big zit on the face of his proposal is the raising the age ... for medicare. i mean, that's a nonstarter, said the california democrat. so if you didn't need to know anything else about his proposal, know that.
the largely rural 5th district, which stretches from sumter in the south to the suburbs of charlotte, north carolina, in the north, has trended increasingly republican in recent years.
when it comes to gun control, parnell supports closing the default to proceed loophole, which permits gun sales without a background check if the fbi does not complete it within three days of the request.
washington (ap) — supreme court nominee amy coney barrett is presenting herself in her final round of confirmation questioning as a judge with deeply held personal and religious beliefs but vowing to keep an open mind on cases. senate republicans are championing her conservative approach to the law as doubtful democrats run out of time to stop her quick confirmation.
the head of iprex, robert m. grant, md, mph, a professor at the university of california, san francisco, school of medicine, all but acknowledges that his team was indeed ill suited to determine how to help prep succeed among black msm. asked over email whether more research is needed into how better to promote prep uptake and adherence among black msm, he replies, no, not in my opinion and not in the way that research is usually funded. does anyone really need white research network chairs and nih leaders deciding what black people want or need to know?
the affordable care act's architects always expected to revisit health care. they understood the law would not fix all of the problems in the u.s. health care system ― and that it would create some new ones along the way. still, they hoped to create a program that would run smoothly, make coverage available to most residents and prove broadly popular.
senator ted cruz (r-texas), meanwhile, is begging for help from the same gop leaders he's attacked in the past (like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), whom cruz called a liar a few years back) as he tries to fend off a serious challenge from democratic congressman beto o'rourke, who is galvanizing support across texas and coming up even with cruz in polls. it appears grassroots fundraising has slowed for cruz and exploded for o'rourke.
although president donald trump has said he hopes the challenge to the affordable care act succeeds, republicans have mostly distanced themselves from it. democrats, for their part, have been highly critical of the case. that includes president-elect joe biden, who on tuesday called the gop-led lawsuit cruel and needlessly divisive, particularly amid the coronavirus pandemic.
the new inspector general investigations will likely serve as new fodder for committee democrats who have voiced concerns about ethical lapses by agency officials and voted against bernhardt's nomination last month, citing his long list of potential conflicts of interests stemming from his years as an oil and gas lobbyist. thursday's hearing will give lawmakers a rare opportunity to question the person who has overseen the agency's ethics office since early in zinke's tenure, and would continue to do so if confirmed as solicitor. zinke resigned in january under a cloud of ethics scandals.
it's also a bit of an odd litmus test in the context of other nations' universal health care programs, which are meant to be the models for plans like medicare for all. private insurance even exists as a supplement to public programs in countries like the united kingdom and canada.
on the senate floor, mcconnell asked for consent to waive a rule that prevents committees from meeting for more than two hours after the senate convenes. the senate met at noon on wednesday, which would mean that no committees could meet after 2 p.m. unless mcconnell got consent. schumer objected to granting that consent.
several former biden staffers whom huffpost interviewed said they did not recall him warning obama to wait on major health care reform. they didn't dispute the published accounts or recollections of other officials per se, but they argued that it would be wrong to interpret such episodes as anything more than biden offering his candid advice on priorities in order to get the most out of obama's first term.
what i really appreciate is when candidates actually canvass, like go door to door to those communities and actually talk to people, she added. just remind them of dates when they need to vote, remind them and actually have voter registrations.
on monday, the department of justice asked federal courts to throw out all of obamacare, not just one part of it, as it had done previously. the turnabout has undercut some of the gop's rhetoric regarding the law and has handed democrats a potent issue for the 2020 presidential campaign.
she recently posted a photo on instagram, apparently from her wedding, with her dad. thank you for teaching me how to be a viking warrior — even when some thought it more appropriate for boys, she wrote.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) tried to convince the president he had no leverage and wouldn't be able to make democrats give him $5.7 billion to build a border wall. paul ryan, who was then the speaker of the house, told trump he saw no way for republicans to win a standoff. and kevin mccarthy, then the house majority leader, warned that a shutdown during the holiday season was a bad idea.
meanwhile, the president's campaign released new numbers suggesting he's likely the first incumbent president to face a fundraising disadvantage in the modern era.
bates acknowledged in his decision that aetna was among the insurers losing money on obamacare policies and that those losses could have been a factor in considering whether to eliminate insurance plans.
title i – energy and commerce:
notably, as huffpost's alexander c. kaufman reported, democrats removed language calling for ending fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks from its party platform.
here are some of the ways obama's presidency has benefited parents:
jim bourg / reuters attorney general jeff sessions discusses a new justice department initiative on religious liberty during an event in june.
peterson the pig farmer brought grassley a bottle of tums that he said the senator would need for the next few years, according to the new york times. grassley later told reporters that the only time he needs the heartburn medication is when he has eaten chocolate ice cream before going to bed.
indeed, cruz expresses the disease in its purest form. he is gratuitously cruel in his comments about others -- who can forget his deathless assertion that, in debate, mitt romney french-kissed barack obama. he uses his own gop colleagues as targets for lies, slander and smears. he panders to hatred and suspicion of all muslims. he casts his irresponsible grandstanding -- like trying to shut down the government -- as lonely heroics. he denies climate change and compares himself to galileo. he wallows in fake piety while perpetrating dirty tricks. he demonizes disagreement and lies without compunction. he shows no real empathy for anyone.
correction: a previous version of this article misstated that maine added ranked-choice voting to its new primary voting system. ranked-choice voting was considered but ultimately did not pass.
kavanaugh said wednesday that he couldn't give assurances that he would uphold pre-existing condition requirements under obamacare as constitutional if the issue arose before him on the supreme court in the future.
and, although buttigieg's plan is less ambitious than the approach sanders and warren endorse, it would make health care more affordable for millions of americans and make sure almost everybody has comprehensive insurance.
but that hasn't stopped republicans from deploying racist attacks this election season in full force. as frank sharry of the immigration group america's voice notes, we can expect an ugly midterm election strategy: smear immigrants as criminals and attack democrats for defending them.
the application for iowa's farm bureau plans requires people to provide five years of medical records and disclose virtually any medical issue within that time frame. and it's not just serious conditions like cancer. ear, nose or throat ailments is one of the categories. a section in the 13-page application for tennessee's plan asks about 66 different health conditions, including everything from autoimmune disorders to allergies. just to be safe, question 67 asks about any other disease, disorder, medical condition, spells, symptoms or treatment not previously listed on this application.
and while the arizona democratic party has pitched in for tipirneni with a field office, staff and get-out-the-vote resources, national democratic groups, including the democratic congressional campaign committee and the democratic national committee, have not given her any cash directly.
thursday's debate moderators were two white men, one black woman and one latino man. it was a diverse group of questioners, and it paid off. some of the strongest questions of the night came from abc news correspondent linsey davis and univision anchor jorge ramos.
it is not actually his fault, because the president of the united states is fundamentally a mouthpiece or a figurehead position for the power structure of this country. a power structure, many have learned, because of things like the occupy wall street movement, that is woefully slanted toward the richest 1 percent of our population.
i hope they get an earful from their constituents back home ― that asking folks to work, train or volunteer for 20 hours a week in order to participate in public assistance is a good thing, rep. mike conaway (r-texas), chairman of the house agriculture committee, told reporters in july.
ryan insisted such redistribution would ultimately leave the poor better off, in part by improving the economy as a whole. but he also justified his agenda in moral terms, speaking frequently about makers (i.e., people who work and earn good incomes) and takers (i.e., lazy people who subsist on government assistance).
it had taken time to build that coalition, just as it took time to craft the legislation ― and to work through all tradeoffs of politics and policy. (when obama was thinking through the complications, he'd twist an invisible rubik's cube in the air, vox noted recently.) working within parameters the congressional budget office had set, democrats ended up with a plan that, by the cbo's reckoning, would expand coverage and reduce the deficit ― just as they'd always promised.
khanna emphasized that it was easy to monday morning quarterback the deals that pelosi had cut on previous bills, but it was much more difficult to actually get more from mcconnell and the trump administration.
for instance, florida senator rick scott claimed the deal would require the elimination of airplanes, but politifact pointed out airplanes aren't mentioned at all.
in connecticut, lamont signed a law in january that provides interest-free loans to federal workers affected by the government shutdown — his first piece of legislation after being sworn in on jan. 9. both essential and nonessential federal workers can apply for loans of up to $5,000.
oxford university rolled out a coronavirus vaccine trial in south africa on wednesday, marking the first such human study on the african continent.
those americans who do have opinions on the confirmation tend to feel strongly about their position. nearly identical percentages ― 84 percent of those who favor his confirmation and 83 percent of those who oppose it ― say that the issue is at least somewhat important to them, with 52 and 53 percent, respectively, calling it very important.
but there was plenty to draw the eye's attention among the people who were still stranded in the long line that snaked around the pennsylvania farm show expo center & expo center, where an alpaca show was splitting the bill with the republican frontrunner.
during tuesday's long and lively session, she declined to say whether she would recuse herself from any election-related cases involving the heated race between trump and democratic nominee joe biden.
trump's claims that obama wiretapped him at trump tower in 2016 has required his own department of justice lawyers to concede, in official federal court filings, that trump's assertions are at times completely baseless.
the white house asked the supreme court in june to overturn the full aca, which could end coverage for nearly 23 million americans.
after ocasio-cortez's stunning defeat of crowley, a powerful democratic leader who had been mentioned as a future speaker of the house, other progressive candidates are trying to follow suit.
republicans have tried over and over again to coalesce around a cheaper and less government-focused replacement for obamacare, and they've failed every time. cobbling together a plan that preserves some of the most popular parts of the law ― such as its guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions, expanded medicaid coverage, and provisions allowing young people to remain on their parents' policy until the age of 26 ― without a mechanism like obamacare is extremely difficult, and maybe even impossible, a fact that even some republicans acknowledge.
it would be very hard. that's all pie in the sky, said sen. joni ernst (r-iowa), adding that conversations were needed to explore how we move it forward.
i'm always sick of the candidate that shows up to a church and just walks away. that has always ... i'm not calling out any candidate, but that's just the trope that just occurs and occurs, harrington said. and i'm waiting for the day when black communities just say, 'you know what? unless we see what you're doing, you're just not going to step foot in this church and just take photo ops with people.'
this should make people think again before (once again) saying that an absolutely ludicrous argument had no chance of destroying the aca in scotus, leah litman, a university of michigan law professor and former supreme court clerk, told huffpost.
so far, that has not shown up in polls. public surveys released this week showed democratic candidates leading in iowa and north carolina, the two states likely to determine the senate majority, and a close race in south carolina, a deeply conservative state where judiciary committee chair lindsey graham finds himself in an unexpectedly tight battle for reelection.
the lawsuit that led to the texas ruling was brought by a coalition of 20 republican-led states including texas, alabama and florida.
it was less than two months ago that president donald trump, during the state of the union address, declared that one of his priorities was to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. it was a vow he has made repeatedly, going back to the 2016 campaign ― and yet it is one he has also broken repeatedly.
martha viehmann, of anderson township near cincinnati, said the state, after falling badly to trump, has come alive. sen. sherrod brown, one of the stronger progressives in the senate, faces a critical re-election bid in 2018.
the ad is emotional and devastating ― and may help explain why bishop is now talking about one of his own family members. on sunday morning, while he and slotkin debated each other on wdiv, the detroit nbc affiliate, bishop said that his wife grew up with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. my wife has a pre-existing condition, bishop said. it is first and foremost on my mind.
trump has long promised a replacement for the aca, but has yet to come up with one. he promised when he first took office to repeal and replace it within 100 days of stepping into the white house.
in classic trumpian fashion, he simply lied and said the worst wouldn't happen because he was on top of things. at least some voters might believe this, which would lessen the blow. but this pose couldn't last, as gop lawmakers tossed the hot potato back in his direction every time someone asked about it.
she added, that's where i'll continue to be.
that would be good news if it were remotely tethered to reality. but congressional republicans and president donald trump have been threatening those protections since obamacare became law in 2010, and have yet to present an alternate plan to provide the same guarantee. and senate republicans begin hearings monday on the nomination of amy coney barrett to the supreme court, where she would be in a position to kill the aca.
michigan, a state that was pivotal in trump's 2016 presidential victory, was actually one of the states where republicans fared worse. they lost a pair of closely contested congressional races along with the top statewide offices, up to and including governor.
the closings were the latest in a trend that has seen 21 rural hospitals across texas shuttered in the past six years, leaving 160 still operating.
but if conservative justices, especially roberts and kavanaugh, are not inclined to hear the case now, litman added, the more liberal justices must consider whether to force the issue and whether they will be burning their favors [and] capital with them by granting the case now when the chief [and] kavanaugh might not want to take it now.
what this crisis has taught us is that, our health care system and our public health are only as strong as the sickest person in this country, she said.
pres. trump promised a health care plan before the end of august. it never came. now he's teasing it again and not offering details.
the lammers understood they were not buying a traditional insurance product. the company literature made clear the couple was ultimately responsible for their own bills, and that medi-share had limits and offered no guarantees of payment. still, after listening to their friends in medi-share talk about their experiences ― and after speaking with the company's representatives ― the lammers came to believe medi-share would take care of their expenses just as well as the company plan they had from danielle's old employer.
on wednesday, with the tweet and later a speech in wisconsin, trump pretended none of this was happening. just like he has before. just like he is almost certain to do again on thursday, when he gives a speech at the department of health and human services.
we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end.

once the government takes over the healthcare system, it's nearly impossible to undo the damage. that's why u. s. lawmakers must repeal and replace obamacare sooner than later. canada proves that single-payer health care inevitably results in rationing and lost lives. government-run health care is one canadian import we should turn away. (2)
trump's reelection campaign, meanwhile, is focused on the economy and the historically low jobless rate while ignoring the government's red ink.
meanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration ― reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
the republican bill would cause millions of people to lose their coverage — but it would also increase costs significantly for those who remain insured, the researchers wrote. although it's just one study, and fairly rough, it's consistent with studies that found the republican tax credit scheme would force older and poorer consumers to get far less assistance from the federal government ― which would mean either they'd have to pay a lot more to get a comprehensive policy, or make do with one that covered a lot less.
that's not to say that the pac bestows its endorsement on every military or public service veteran who happens to be running for office. the goal of moulton's initiative is to help democrats flip the house, so he has limited himself to candidates in swing districts who he has determined are the best candidates to win in the general election.
alegeus healthcare, a provider of platforms for corporate insurance plans, compiles an annual healthcare consumerism index that measures the degree of engagement ... exhibited during healthcare spending and saving decisions. it reports that the index this year jumped to 54.4 from 48.3. so, we're doing better.
one fox show invited walsh to appear, but on the condition he agreed to speak only about issues and not attack trump, according to the walsh campaign. walsh declined. his number-one issue at campaign stops and in media interviews is trump's unfitness for the office.
it would appear the effort was not so successful.
it's centered around white behavior, and then we're always compared to white behavior when our relationship to democracy and voting in this country is distinctively different, brown said, noting black voters' pragmatism. we're voting for people who's going to provide the most protection for us in our circumstances, but not necessarily because they've got to be the next superstar. we haven't felt like that about many candidates.
trump's proposal would cut $465 billion from medicare providers such as hospitals, which prompted howls from democrats such as former vice president joe biden, who said it eviscerates medicare, while top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york said trump is planning to rip away health care from millions of americans with cuts to medicare and the medicaid health program for the poor.
but current gop proposals to replace the law ― such as block grants ― would result in far less federal spending on health care and thus far fewer insured people.
as democratic presidential candidates tout their plans to promote voting rights and political participation, democrats in the states are already working to strengthen voting rights measures.
what they do next is crucial. if house republicans drop the lawsuit or appropriate the money to keep the subsidies flowing, it not only would make sure low-income families keep their benefits, but it would quell a major source of worry for insurance companies.
in truth, trump has never thought past repealing the aca and still has no coherent health care agenda. he and congressional republicans failed to repeal it in 2017 and haven't tried again. but trump's justice department backs a lawsuit brought from a group of state republican officials to achieve the same outcome, a case the supreme court is due to hear one week after election day. if the plaintiffs win, the entire law could disappear, along with health coverage for an estimated 21 million people. companies could also deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions once again.
appearing at a community center in a democratic pocket of his new jersey district, macarthur fielded questions for nearly five hours from a loud and feisty crowd about his role in crafting the gop health care bill and its effect on the insurance marketplace. a few constituents also demanded that he call for a special prosecutor to investigate whether president donald trump's aides colluded with russia during the presidential campaign.
in the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed essential and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances. many will miss their first paycheck on jan. 11 unless trump signs a spending bill before then. employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.
as in the rest of the country, michigan has rural patches with fewer, largely more expensive options. people who don't get subsidies and stay with their current plans will pay more. but it's also not hard to find residents like amy lynn smith, a detroit-area freelance writer with diabetes who said the law is saving her hundreds of dollars a month in premiums.
helzer said the meeting of the progressive caucus was especially popular at the convention, with about 600 people showing up.
the federal government has been shut down since early saturday because the senate didn't approve a deal on the four-week spending bill needed to keep it open. forty-four democrats and four republicans voted against that bill, with many saying they wouldn't support anything that didn't help the 700,000 undocumented young people trump put at risk of losing deportation protections when he ended daca. other lawmakers who voted no said short-term spending bills are a bad way to operate the government.
republicans in washington, d.c., have also done their part to undermine the law. marco rubio, the gop senator from florida, led a successful crusade to pull funding from the affordable care act's risk corridor program, which was supposed to insulate insurers from big losses in the early years of implementation. some insurers took big losses as a result, and a few even shut down.
highland, ind. — president donald trump is set to fly to indiana on thursday night for a campaign rally, and if senate republicans have their way, his first goal will be to slam joe donnelly.
as president, trump has shown time and again that his real health care agenda amounts to less health care, less security and fewer people covered. trump has used many tools to undermine and sabotage affordable care act programs ― which he straight-up promised to do as soon as he took office. it's one of the few promises he's kept.
in maine, a new measure expands abortion access by allowing advanced practice clinicians such as physician assistants and registered nurses to perform abortion procedures ― not just doctors. gov. janet mills (d) said the measure would expand abortion access, particularly to people living in rural areas.
bill maher dissected the gop's failure to repeal and replace obamacare on friday.
in follow-up interviews, respondents who indicated wanting to withdraw were less ideological than an expression of protest. in a 2009 story on the sooner poll, one of us (keith gaddie) similarly described the desire to secede as a take your ball and go home attitude. support for secession reflects less of a desire to leave than a sense of aggrievement with the federal government.
we expected the market to be bigger, with more people and more younger people than we enrolled, rick notter, director of the exchange business for michigan blue cross blue shield, told me recently.
the regulation published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services on thursday is a response to insurers' demands that federal authorities take steps to limit consumers' ability to drop in and out of the insurance market. such gaming of the system drives up costs for the carriers that must cover the consumers' claims.
attacking obama was a common theme among candidates in that race. texas sen. ted cruz frequently rallied his audiences by promising to repeal every word of obamacare and rip the iranian nuclear deal to shreds on his first day in office. florida sen. marco rubio even suggested that obama's policies were not merely misguided, but intentionally designed to hurt america.
they're asking the court to reconsider, which is something, bagley said. but there are lots of ways to limit the scope in the meantime and they've chosen to do none of them. ... normally, you would work a lot harder, as the federal government, to keep your program going.
in the past, experts note, local and state governments have sometimes declined to spend money available to them through public or private grants, precisely because they worried that the money would run out and they'd be stuck with programs that couldn't sustain on their own.

instead, mcsally and her comrades keep suggesting they want to preserve the kinds of guarantees that current law provides, even though independent analysts and experts have debunked them repeatedly.
herring and fairfax were considered leading contenders for the governorship, but they've both had to weather scandals. herring admitted that he wore blackface at a college party in 1980. his comments came after a racist photograph in northam's medical school yearbook page surfaced. (northam is not running again due to term limits.) and last year, two women accused fairfax of sexual assault in the early 2000s. he has denied the allegations. mcclellan said her run, and the outpouring of support for women and women of color, is not directly in response to those scandals. black women have been the backbone of our communities and our economy but have been relegated to the shadows or the back over the past 400 years, she said in her interview with huffpost. and again, whether it's sojourner truth and harriet tubman, or ida b. wells, or shirley chisholm, have said, you know, we're going to keep pushing and keep striving for progress. we're at a critical moment where we've broken through. ... so this is not something in response to 2019; it's the natural progression of 400 years of just pushing through to lead.
this is wonky stuff, but the notion behind it is to let states with a deregulatory bent allow the sale of plans with skimpier benefits and less financial protection than what's on their local market now.
the problem is you also have to have all of the republican governors supporting whatever you do or you're not going to get the support of 51 folks stepping in, rounds said. realize we need 51 votes on this, and if you don't treat your states appropriately, you're probably not going to get your 51 votes.

after high school, mekelburg attended the university of rhode island and graduated in 1996 with a degree in communication studies. she started dating future husband salvatore sal siino, who had also grown up in new jersey and earned a cluster of fancy degrees, including an mba from harvard business school. in 2003, siino took a job in new york city. by then, he and mekelburg were a couple. they moved to manhattan's upper east side.
as someone who has served as a consumer representative on boards that evaluate new treatments, i can tell you that patient engagement is critically important to assessing what really works in terms of treatment and care, and what research is needed to inform decision making.
the house republican bill included some extra funding for states to use in other ways to help people with pre-existing conditions. in the debate, mcsally alluded to this but failed to mention that, according to multiple experts, the money was not nearly enough to do the job.
swensen declined to discuss individual cases, saying the hospital was bound by patient confidentiality. uva health ceo pamela sutton-wallace declined an interview request. a spokeswoman for northam did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
in expansion states, medicaid could serve as a valuable stopgap for people who lose jobs and health benefits. if you've just had a big change in income, like you lost your job and your income went down to nothing, and you live in an expansion state, which is most of the states, there's a good chance you're going to qualify for medicaid, pollitz said.
mexican citizens wishing to enter the us will be scanned, branded and processed. next, they meet with none other than mr. tony robbins. he will teach them how to walk on burning coals with bare feet. a much-needed skill before accessing the drawbridge that only opens once a month. the hombres will approach the bridge to cross trump guantomino moat. here they will drop their knives and guns into the trump incinerator. the melted steel turns to a liquid and is then funneled underground for 2000 miles to the north. the destination will become the foundation for the trump canuck wall with canada. this wall will be completed in time for the donald's second inauguration in 2021.
the senate on thursday rejected a bill that would restrict the trump administration from funding a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the affordable care act that is scheduled for oral arguments at the supreme court just days after the nov. 3 election.
influential organizations including the idaho medical association, idaho hospital association and aarp formed a coalition three years ago to promote medicaid expansion called close the gap idaho. so far, however, those groups haven't pitched in to help collect signatures for the ballot initiative.
democrats had few procedural tools available to block the nomination, which they argued was illegitimate because of the gop's hypocrisy in confirming a supreme court nominee during a presidential election year.

premiums or out-of-pocket costs remain a lot higher than many people feel they can afford, and insurer pullouts have left some areas, particularly rural ones, with few or even no choice of insurers. but some carriers are expanding their options, filling in gaps others are leaving, and many industry officials say the biggest source of uncertainty isn't the underlying market weakness that plagued the program in its first few years; it's the neglect and sabotage from hostile officials, including the ones working out of the white house.
yes, those are pretty big stakes. no, you haven't heard a lot about it lately.
after health and human services secretary tom price said sunday that nobody will be worse off financially under the republicans' plan, breitbart news mocked the claim on twitter and questioned whether it would go down as the lie of the year. a congressional budget office and joint committee on taxation report published monday suggests that as many as 24 million people could lose health insurance as a result of the gop bill.
if insurers had no idea who'd be sick and who'd be healthy when they sign up for insurance (and keep them insured at the same price even after they become sick), this wouldn't be a problem. but they do know – and they're developing more and more sophisticated ways of finding out.
in twin falls, democratic state senate candidate deborah silver, who lost a state senate race in 2016 and the state treasurer race in 2014, hosted a meeting in her home.
nevertheless, the republican governors of oklahoma and tennessee are still seeking federal approval to accept more limited federal funding for their medicaid programs, respectively known as soonercare and tenncare.
for example, in a september 2015 60 minutes interview with scott pelley, trump said that everybody's got to be covered and that the government's gonna pay for it. at a february 2016 gop primary debate, trump told the audience, what i do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a republican, i don't want that to happen. we're going to take care of people that are dying on the street, because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we're going to take care of those people.
economist jonathan gruber, one of the obama administration's advisors responsible for passage of the aca, in his post-debate interview on cnn said, the problem with obamacare was that insurance companies were not given the protections they wanted in order to participate in that market. both senators cruz and sanders would dismiss this as ridiculous. bernie thought insurance company executives were making enough money and didn't need more. it was cruz and the republicans that voted against releasing an additional $7-plus billion to insurance companies to cover losses on obamacare policies, at a time when those same companies were experiencing record profits.
other gop ads accused harrison of supporting eliminating the filibuster and packing the supreme court ― charges he denied at a campaign stop on monday.
the idea of taking one vote to repeal the law, with plans to come up with a replacement afterwards, is not new.
they are now feeling the heat, schumer said.
neither state has expanded medicaid eligibility to more of its low-income residents under the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. in fact, the closures and at-risk hospitals are heavily clustered in the 14 states that have not expanded.
biden pointed out that trump was criticizing a position the democratic nominee doesn't actually hold. although many democrats support medicare for all, which would eliminate private insurance in order to create one government-run plan, biden is not among them.
when sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders ― among them, sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a white house bid. that announcement came one day after sen. kamala harris of california, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for medicare for all in a new york times op-ed. and, of course, sanders himself is widely expected to run again.
pennsylvania sen. bob casey (d) noted that trump is saying exactly the opposite of what his party is doing.
but even the existing farm bureau plans have limits, like the $3-million cap on lifetime benefits in iowa. the tiny handful of people such a threshold could affect would be the ones with the medical conditions that require the most intensive, expensive therapies.
it is not good enough to work on a compromise for months and months and months with no solution, jolly said. the time for the politics of zika is over. the politics of zika are garbage right now. the fact that candidates are going to spend money on commercials about zika instead of responding together in a bipartisan, bicameral way in a divided government to a public health crisis that americans understand ― we are wasting time. that is why i'm joined by these mosquitoes today.
on monday, carson penned an op-ed for fox news explaining why he'd stay in the gop presidential primary race despite polling behind the other four candidates -- business mogul donald trump, ohio gov. john kasich and sens. marco rubio (fla.) and ted cruz (texas).

the third-year political science major and statewide president for the college democrats of america showed up to campus that morning wearing a badass shirt with the democratic donkey, clearly indicating her politics.
voter turnout was low, even for an off-year election on relatively obscure local matters, mayville said. the enthusiasm of the volunteers in idaho falls, pocatello and twin falls didn't translate into a lot of signatures.
you may have heard that less than 20% of what physicians do has solid medical research to support it. that's kind of astounding when you think about it. doctors do something because that's the way they were trained to do it, and until new information comes to light, they will continue to do it the same way. take the treatment for ear infections in kids. doctors prescribe or parents demand tubes, antibiotics, anything to stop the pain. but good research shows that too many antibiotics have negative outcomes. as a result, treatment for ear infections has changed appropriately over the past several years. same for tonsillectomies, the third most frequent surgery for children.
mulvaney also, inexplicably, said in a speech at the oxford club in england last month that the u.s. is in desperate need of more immigrant workers for economic growth — even as his boss has continued to crack down on immigrants.
i really thought, until now, that i had done my part and was content to enjoy my retirement and all of the great activities available to us here in southwest colorado, she said. many new people are getting in the game, many of them young, recent college graduates. we just had our two-year reorganizational meeting last saturday, and two recent graduates were elected to the county executive committee. now that the dems are fired up and involved, it has become apparent that many of us are progressives and may have been when no one noticed.
greater access to health care for people with pre-existing conditions who were shut out of the old market and those whose low incomes made health insurance too expensive before the affordable care act's subsidies became available in 2014 was one of the core goals of the law president barack obama enacted six years ago.
barkan is in the advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or als, a degenerative neurological disease that has taken away his mobility and his ability to speak without assistance. in order to address the virtual convention, he used a text-to-voice computer program ― the same technology that he employed more than a year ago when he traveled to washington to testify before congress.
and wouldn't it be the same for other essential benefits ― slightly lower premiums for all, but much higher out-of-pocket costs for the people who might need some of those other essential services?
even if republicans can't jam trumpcare through congress, make no mistake that they'll create it by sabotaging the current health care system, step by step, murray said. we've already seen it start to happen ― and democrats will be ready to hold republicans accountable and make clear exactly what's going on and who's responsible.
when mueller first dropped his report in april, it didn't have the type of impact democrats wanted. it didn't do much to sway public opinion. and supporters of president donald trump who heard mueller speak still thought the report cleared him.
and new mexico lawmakers increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, from $7.50 (just above the $7.25 federal minimum wage) to $9. they intend to further increase the minimum wage to $12 by 2023. the state also raised the minimum wage for teachers and tipped workers.
many who buy short-term plans will appreciate the chance to get insurance for much lower monthly premiums. if not for the availability of short-term plans, some of them would not have gotten any insurance at all. but those plans also don't provide the same kind of protection against medical bills, which means that some people who buy the plans will discover ― upon getting sick ― they don't have coverage they need.
she looks for a judge who will follow the facts and the law where they lead, clark said. she does not, however, use an ideological litmus test to disqualify or approve judges because of their personal beliefs.
we'd like to see more candidates offer concrete ideas for how people can join together, henry said. despite union jobs being discussed in the detroit debates, she added, there was virtually no discussion of how a presidential candidate would empower workers to join unions.
democratic leaders emerged from that session proclaiming they're unified in their opposition to repeal, unified in their zeal to resist and unified in their refusal to help republicans devise new health care reforms until they see the gop's opening bid at an obamacare replacement ― something that republicans have failed to produce during the eight years since the affordable care act debate began.
norfolk, neb. ― danielle lammers, a 35-year-old administrative assistant, wife and mother, had a bump on the back of her lower thigh. it had been there for as long as she could remember, but in july of last year it started to hurt while the family was on vacation at a lakeside cabin in missouri. her family doctor referred her to a surgeon who could remove it, though she soon learned she was pregnant and had to put off the procedure until she was in her second trimester.
the jct crashed a final report on the conference bill, concluding the final version would add nearly $1.1 trillion to the national debt. but, the report was finished the day trump signed the bill into law, on dec. 22, 2017, so lawmakers never got to use it.
still, if democrats get a chance to start legislating, they will have to make choices about emphasis and political strategy. do they insist on single-payer or something close to it, negotiating back from that? or continue to push hard for more incremental measures?
it centered on the law's so-called individual mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. in 2012, the u.s. supreme court rejected a challenge to the mandate, ruling that the penalty was allowed through congress' power to tax.
as it happens, that part isn't entirely true. the markets appear to be in better shape than burr and his allies concede ― or perhaps even realize. just this week, the henry j. kaiser family foundation released a study of insurer financial performance that concluded the individual market has been stabilizing and insurers are regaining profitability.
politically, it makes sense to give solutions that make sense, fitzpatrick said, mentioning better interstate competition and medical liability reform.
i am not about folks who have good ideas. i want to see some evidence that you have a plan, that you know what you're going to do to take me from here to there, she said. she has a plan for all these different issues that she can show that there is going to be a way for it to be successful. that's why i support her.
but overall, there is plenty for liberals to like in a bill that would cost an estimated $3 trillion.
there are a lot of eyeballs there that are only there, wessel said of the twitch buy. the people who are on twitch are not watching msnbc. the folks who are there are only there.
a problem for the repeal and replace plan is that republicans haven't coalesced around a replacement for obamacare since it was signed into law almost seven years ago. one idea they are reportedly considering is immediately passing a repeal bill that actually leaves elements of the affordable care act in place for as long as another four years.
the department of labor on thursday proposed a regulation that would make it easier for some individuals and small businesses to get coverage exempt from some key obamacare rules, including a requirement that all plans cover 10 essential benefits.
her trajectory began with a fight over congressional testimony. she'd been denied the opportunity to testify before a house panel about the need for insurance companies to cover contraception. the exclusion ticked off democrats, who noted that only men were on hand to discuss an issue with a disproportionate impact on women. the democrats held their own panel with fluke and others. republicans declined to show up.
and in this scenario, trump could gain what he desires most: public affection. it would be a sordid and petty way to resolve this eight-year long conflict, but at long last, it would provide a way for everyone finally to win.
the bill also extends the extra $600 per week for unemployment through the end of the year. the extra $600 from the federal government — designed as a lifeline to many of the 33 million unemployed — is currently scheduled to expire at the end of july, and republicans have said they'll oppose any effort to keep the full amount past then out of concern that it disincentives work.
a federal judge on thursday blocked a trump administration effort to undermine part of the affordable care act.
have been a u.s. citizen for the last seven years
in 2012, the supreme court considered and ultimately rejected a constitutional challenge to the affordable care act's individual mandate, the financial penalty for people who had access to insurance but didn't buy it. in that case, a five-to-four majority led by chief justice john roberts ruled that the mandate was a constitutionally permissible tax.
while [the centers for medicare and medicaid services] has taken steps to correct some of the current challenges in the marketplace, these changes likely are not significant enough to sway health plan decisions for the upcoming plan year, cara kelly, vice president at avalere health, said in a press release. losing health plans from the exchanges is still a risk for 2018.
the circuit courts of alexandria and fairfax do not use the statewide case management system and are not included in this analysis.
but that gave people an idea. if repeal immediately and replace whenever was backed by the president, maybe that strategy could be used on him.
either way, absent a guarantee of maternity coverage, most insurers will not offer it or charge extra for it ― which, in either case, means the people who want it would have to pay more.
did it make enough of an impression to change outcomes in the tipping states? quite possibly, especially insofar as trump's management of the crisis was a constant reminder of an erratic, tumultuous presidency many americans simply have come to find exhausting.
dozens of patient and healthcare industry groups, including the american medical association, american hospital association, american cancer society and seniors advocacy group aarp also filed briefs in support of the law.
if republicans get through the midterm elections with their congressional majorities intact, next year could play out in the very same way. gop leaders have already made clear that they will try once again to repeal the health care law if they can.
and all four of the 2020 contenders co-sponsoring the sanders bill have indicated during campaign appearances they would also support more incremental efforts to achieve universal coverage, such as proposals that would allow employers to keep offering private coverage for employees who want it.
biden knows this because, as he likes to remind voters, he was part of the last big health care battle and lived through the political fallout. a lot of what he said this week was unfair. but not all of it.
huffpost readers: do you have an experience pumping at work you would like to share? get in touch with us.
mekelburg's best connection to this world was through anni cyrus, who produces the glazov gang, an islamophobic talk show that can be found on youtube. host jamie glazov is the editor of one of horowitz's anti-muslim publications. mekelburg asked for cyrus' help in launching her own anti-muslim organization. cyrus, who did not respond to huffpost's requests for comment, greeted mekelburg's overture with enthusiasm.
while many other cases were not so egregious, they shared similar themes, particularly in low-wage fields like retail and food service where workers struggle to find a clean, private space for pumping. many of them are sent to restrooms ― in some cases, even public ones ― despite the fact that the law explicitly says restrooms are unacceptable because they're unsanitary.
biden also sought to win support from the state's auto workers during an appearance at the michigan state fairgrounds. i've always believed in michigan. we have the finest auto workers in the world here, biden said.
it's a tack democrats are pursuing throughout the midwest, nominating a self-proclaimed nerd in ohio's richard cordray, a deal-cutting legislative insider in michigan's gretchen whitmer, and a buttoned-down businessman in iowa's fred hubbell. all are promising to end one type of chaos or another: hubbell is promising to undo a flawed privatization of medicaid; and whitmer's modest major policy promises are to fix the damn roads and end the water crisis in flint. evers is focused on protecting pre-existing conditions and fixing the state's potholes, which he calls scottholes.
moulton, 39, styles himself a new democrat, but given where the energies in his party lie at the moment, he sounded very much like the old guard. he was there to talk about his serve america pac, which helps elect veterans. the pac added 12 candidates to its list of endorsements and expanded its endorsement criteria to include people who have performed other types of public service. the pac is endorsing state and local candidates for the first time; four down-ballot contenders are among the 12 additions.
after years of republicans trying to repeal the protections stopping insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, now trump says the protections are unconstitutional. republicans always had to defend those votes in this election, but now they have to defend his decree too, said jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist who works with health care advocacy groups.
in other words, the realtor association's ahp is subject to the same rules as policies that insurers sell to individuals, directly or through obamacare's exchanges. similarly, the state business organization's plan is subject to the same rules for all small employers.
trump supporters who gathered to hear pence speak at a tightly packed airport hanger with little social distancing in greenville on tuesday said they appreciated what graham had done for the president, even if they didn't get along at first.
respondents also preferred keeping medicaid as an open guarantee rather than a flat amount doled out to states or recipients. the program currently provides as much funding as necessary to cover eligible recipients health care costs.
congress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions. ... it repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place, the scholars write.
connecticut also closed a loophole on ghost guns ― untraceable firearms sold in parts and assembled at home ― now making it illegal to manufacture a firearm without subsequently engraving or permanently attaching an identifying mark to it, like a serial number, so the gun can be traced.
alex wong/getty images president barack obama and his democratic allies knew the affordable care act needed improvements.
callen-lorde has the largest prep program—2,400 people strong—in new york state, of whom only 12 percent are black. we know that historically, black lives have not mattered in this country, and we need to turn that around, especially when it comes to prep, hardikar says.
of course, her strategy isn't easily replicated. jealous and garcia were hammered by millions of dollars in attack ads from the republican governors association, leaving them with little chance of success. but abrams, a favorite of both the democratic small-dollar donor base and the party's megadonors, had more than enough cash to invest in getting her message out, parrying gop attacks and getting out her core voters.
when we extend the olive branch and focus on common wins that chip away at root problems, we gain listeners and build mutual respect. while some policies may need to change, we can always circle back later to discuss them after the hurt and distrust have been replaced by a foundation for fruitful and cooperative engagement.
let's recall that most of the founding fathers despised the idea of party systems, and for good cause. it's hard to unite against common threats when we're busy point-scoring and vilifying the other team. the dnc needs to make it clear in their policy, their rhetoric, and their actions that they're going to fight like hell for all of us, arm in arm with any republicans who share an interest of keeping winter at bay.
when pushed by maddow, clinton reiterated that there are genuine policy differences between her and sanders that need to be debated, but she insisted that the attacks will not be personal.
leakes, who was once a democrat, said he felt the party took him for granted, so he began questioning why black people had to vote along democratic party lines at the ballot box. not even democratic efforts to fight against voter suppression can win over leakes, mainly because he doesn't believe it exists in south carolina, but also because he served on the south carolina state election commission in columbia for five years. he believes voting in south carolina is a fair game. similarly, he believes individuals should be able to fend for themselves, though he knows there have been historical barriers for black people seeking economic gain.

collins surely knows kavanaugh opposes legal abortion and that justice anthony kennedy's retirement leaves roe hanging in the balance. but absent some ideological awakening, it's hard to see her coming down against someone who has made all the right noises about respecting precedent.
washington (ap) — fulfilling a campaign promise, president joe biden plans to reopen the healthcare.gov insurance markets for a special sign-up opportunity geared to people needing coverage in the coronavirus pandemic.
kavanaugh refused to say whether he thinks sitting presidents can be made to comply with a legal subpoena, a highly relevant topic given the ongoing russia investigation and deliberations within the white house on whether to allow trump to sit down for an interview with special counsel robert mueller.
it's almost like people are waking up to the fact that black people are capable of yielding an enormous amount of power, garza said. but i think that what gets missed in that, is that somehow we're just inherently political. and i think that the reality is: black folks turning up and turning out is really a function of a whole ecosystem of organizations and institutions that are deeply invested in making sure that we don't get left out of the decisions that are being made about us.
when i saw alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, i knew i did the right thing.
moore is also a seasoned climate change denier who has spent years peddling the fringe, anti-science misinformation that trump and his team have embraced. he has asserted that the historic paris climate agreement was economic poison, called global warming the biggest scam of the last two decades and said america has the cleanest coal in the world.
a lack of consequences from the penalty-less mandate would appear to undercut another gop claim: that the courts cannot sever the mandate and let the rest of the law survive.
washington ― president donald trump, health care failure is not your only option. you can still work with democrats to repair problems with the affordable care act, top democratic senators said thursday.
after the 2016 beatdown, democrats finally began to revamp the party in an effort to address the problems that years of largely unchecked power created. it was an effort to build a movement that is looking not just towards the next election, but to the next 20 years, said ben self, who was elected chairman of the state party in 2017.

at one point in the hearing, sen. chris coons (d-del.) expressed frustration with kavanaugh's inability to give clear answers regarding comments he made two years ago that expressed his desire to overturn a three-decade-old supreme court ruling upholding the constitutionality of an independent counsel. kavanaugh insisted his objection applied only to the independent counsel law and not that of the special counsel. if such questions came before him on the court, he added, he would approach them with an open mind.
he is locked in an increasingly close race with democrat rob quist, 69, a folk music sensation in the state who is running on a populist platform of protecting public lands and making health care more affordable. the special election is this coming thursday.
republican efforts to roll back obamacare were wildly unpopular and a big reason that they lost their majority in the u.s. house of representatives last november. but republicans are still at it, especially in state capitals where they still have full control of legislatures.
it was a beleaguered position that essentially matched where warren was some six weeks ago, when pressure was mounting for her to release a more detailed medicare for all plan. her campaign had hoped that by first releasing a plan on how to finance the ambitious program without raising middle-class taxes and then two weeks later promising to enact it gradually, that it would quiet some of the critics and allow her to move forward with her campaign. but as even some sympathetic analysts admit, in the short term, warren has done neither of those things.
in 2012, the supreme court ruled in favor of the obama administration in a case challenging the law's individual mandate, which requires most u.s. residents to obtain health coverage or face fines for failing to comply. the question in that case was essentially whether the federal government can compel individuals to buy a commercial product and penalize them if they don't. at the time, obama's justice department maintained the entire law couldn't stand without the mandate.
the administration was joined by the little sisters of the poor, an roman catholic order of nuns that is one of the groups seeking an exemption for its employees, in appealing the 3rd circuit ruling to the supreme court.

an investigator found that nurses at a bellevue, washington, hospital couldn't find time to pump due to the nature of the business. one employee there ended up with a breast infection. a time study performed at a michigan hospital revealed that nurses spent the bulk of their 15-minute breaks traveling to and from the lactation room, which was on another floor, leaving them with only five minutes to actually pump. one hospital worker called pumping at work a constant struggle. nursing homes and home care settings accounted for another 19 cases.
the fear grew exponentially when now-sen. doug jones defeated trump-backed roy moore in the special u.s. senate election in alabama last december. but it would quickly fade away: the passage of the gop tax cut law eased tensions, and bannon's blabbing to author michael wolff soon led to his involuntary exit from trump's inner circle.
finally, although it does not directly bear on the discussion of our historical development, there is one other section of the howard speech to emphasize as both especially important, and as central to obama's take on america, in particular given trump's disproportionate appeal to racially resentful white men. it is a call for empathy, about being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes and understand that person's perspective--even if one disagrees with the policy positions to which that perspective gives rise. he was talking to african americans directly, but my hope is that hearing him say this to african americans encourages each of us to apply the lesson to our fellow americans of every background:
last week, the u.s. department of agriculture encouraged states to take away food benefits from custodial parents who refuse to cooperate with child support enforcement, a state-federal program that can track down noncustodial parents and make them pay child support. only six states currently require snap recipients to cooperate with child support. making all of them do it is another thing house republicans tried to pass last year but couldn't.
in short, said gene steuerle, coordinator of treasury's reform effort from 1984 to 1986 and now a fellow at the non-partisan tax policy center in washington, individuals got a modest tax cut and corporations got a modest tax increase. perhaps most important, the measure did not increase the national debt.

now we get to medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program for low-income people, children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and elderly nursing home patients. borrowing from house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and countless gop leaders before him, trump calls for block granting the program. that's another way of saying he wants to set a cap on how much the federal government will give states to run the programs in exchange for allowing states to modify it with less federal involvement. it's also another way of saying he wants to drastically shrink this program, which provides benefits to more than 70 million people.

department of education officials say devos is the lightest of lightweights, and that a handful of her appointees are running the policy efforts at ed, cutting most career staff out of the loop of information, let alone decision-making. in particular, insiders say, robert eitel, a former executive at the predatory schools bridgepoint education and career education corp., is playing a key role in policy affecting for-profit colleges, casting doubt on his commitment to recuse from some matters. a good number of the conscientious career staff are out looking for new jobs.

indeed, trump's proposed cuts to medicaid and subsidies for so-called obamacare health insurance policies total almost $1 trillion over 10 years, according to calculations by the liberal-leaning center on budget and policy priorities, whose president, robert greenstein, called the trump plan stunningly harsh.
the video announcing the launch of her campaign opens with a mention of king: across virginia, people are echoing the words of dr. martin luther king jr.: 'where do we go from here?'
to expand insurance, they relied on medicaid for the poor and a new marketplace of subsidized, regulated insurance for people buying coverage on their own ― while very deliberately leaving employer coverage largely untouched.
republicans argue that medicaid was created to serve the most vulnerable and has become bloated under obamacare. verma and other republicans said implementing work and community engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by connecting people with jobs and training.
embracing the way we do business in washington
obamacare, the signature domestic achievement of trump's democratic predecessor, barack obama, has been a political flashpoint since its passage.
win or lose, though, the mild-mannered parnell has excited local democrats, laying the seeds for future inroads in the state. it is shaping up as an interesting case study for the 50-state strategy that democratic national committee chairman tom perez has vowed to restore.
in a nation facing a critical moment of reckoning with respect to race relations, the racial discrepancy in prep's use thus far may result in yet another example of whites benefiting from a major societal advancement while african americans are largely excluded.
trump is a devoted breitbart reader, as bannon told the huffington post last summer, and some suspect he made an unsubstantiated claim about former president barack obama wiretapping his building after reading an article on the site.

the effect of these coverage losses on individuals' health and financial security is sobering to contemplate, whitmer wrote. as in arkansas, michigan's new law provides no resources for job training, job search, or job supports. there is no reason to expect better job outcomes.
additionally, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has thrown his support behind mcsally. mcconnell and his allies have already bought ads to portray mcsally as stricter on immigration. she previously defended the daca program and supported a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who illegally came to the u.s., but has since moved to the right on the issue.

instead, under orders from attorney general jeff sessions and with the support of president donald trump, the justice department sided with the states and urged the courts to invalidate two of the law's key protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.
newsom's proposal counts as groundbreaking and radical for the u.s., the only developed country in the world that doesn't guarantee paid time off to new mothers; just two of 34 oecd countries do not guarantee paid leave to new fathers. and it comes at a time when democratic state and local politicians around the country are proposing new liberal social programs ― beefing up obamacare protections and provisions and passing greater labor protections. these guys are just catching up with others around the world, however.
but kelly has declined to take a position on the measure, and there's a lot of political pressure to pass it, especially from the farm bureau, which hopes to follow in the footsteps of farm bureau chapters in tennessee and iowa that offer plans under similar auspices.
how did we get into this mess? was there a particular moment in american history that health care really took a decisive turn for the worse?
with that in mind, let's take a look at what the trump campaign says it wants to do. mostly, trumpcare is based on proposals republicans have touted for years, but never put much effort into enacting, even as they continue to claim an obamacare replacement is just around the corner.
associated press in his 1996 state of the union speech, president bill clinton called out republicans for shutting down the government.
as a result we end up with the most bizarre health-insurance system imaginable: one ever better designed to avoid sick people.
as a psychologist, sean kenny has seen how the affordable care act has helped his patients afford therapy, though high deductibles and significant out-of-pocket costs for medications are still challenges for many.
beyond the question of mcconnell's strength, holmes also said he thinks it's impossible for democrats in states like iowa and texas to shift the conversation from the all-encompassing trump to the relatively low-key mcconnell.
if republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal, and then replace at a later date! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 30, 2017
in a nutshell, zubik hinges on the question of whether it's a substantial burden for religious nonprofits to be required to fill out a form noting their objections to providing contraception under the law. the little sisters of the poor and a smattering of religious nonprofits from across the country argue that it does -- that, in fact, it essentially makes them complicit in providing coverage for services they view as sinful. the federal government, which provided this accommodation, obviously disagrees.
the centrist group third way estimated in a report released thursday that 2.2 million trump voters will be worse off under republican leaders' proposed american health care act. many of those voters are rural and white.
the process that first produced obamacare in 2009 and 2010 unfolded a bit differently. it featured its share of backroom deals and at least one big vow that democrats would break. (if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.) but it also featured more than a year of public deliberation, including upwards of 130 hearings across the five committees, according to a tally that democratic staffers compiled at the time. many of these hearings included testimony from both liberal and conservative experts, with opportunities for tough questions by both parties. and that followed a presidential campaign in which the democratic candidates, including the eventual nominee and future president, coalesced quickly around a model for reform and spent their time litigating their relatively narrow disputes in detail.
ryan was hardly the first republican to call for a sweeping rollback of new deal and great society programs. ryan's agenda was in many ways a direct descendant of the plans that newt gingrich, the georgia republican, proposed and tried to enact when he became house speaker in 1995.
new york mayor bill de blasio posed the question on his own.
look, folks, biden told the ibew. this is not who we are. this is not the america we knew growing up.
american airlines announced friday that it plans to resume selling every available seat on flights, even as coronavirus cases have surged in states across the country.
warren, a battle-scarred wall street foe widely considered the most progressive sitting senator after sanders, is evidently trying to make her own mark on health care policy.
emmanuel dunand via getty images change has come to america.
his mother, dawn josephson, told huffpost in 2012 that her family had been spending $1,000 a month out of pocket for services their insurance policy didn't cover, and that the family was afraid a supreme court ruling might invalidate the law and leave her family in the lurch again.
nearly all texas businesses have been allowed to reopen at half or limited capacity. businesses that have already been allowed to reopen can continue to operate under current health protocols.
it remains to be seen if any legislation addressing zika will make it to the president's desk by the end of the week, when lawmakers plan to head out for a seven-week break.

and while it's possible employers could drop coverage on their own, few experts expect that to happen anytime soon. among other things, businesses still see health benefits as a useful way to lure and retain workers, especially the higher-paid workers who wouldn't get much of a subsidy and thus wouldn't save money by switching into the exchanges.
washington started supporting sanders after watching a video explaining his policies by the young turks, a progressive news and opinion program on youtube. he admires sanders' work in the civil rights movement in chicago in the 1960s.
that's exactly what snyder did. when obamacare became law, he reasoned that the state would benefit by making medicaid available to all low-income residents, as the law envisioned, because the federal government would be picking up most of the cost. it would mean more people with insurance, yes, but it would also mean more money for the state and its businesses. snyder wanted michigan to run its own version of the law's marketplaces, because he figured state officials knew the local insurance markets well ― and would be in a position to smooth the transition to a new health insurance system, with more widely available coverage.
i actually have my glock [firearm] with me in the office today, mcsally said, before referencing her military past. the first u.s. woman to pilot a fighter jet in combat, she flew a-10 warthogs that attacked the taliban in afghanistan.
these provisions are among the law's most popular features, because they make insurance available to some of the people who need it most. they are likely part of the reason that, according to numerous studies, the public as a whole has better access to care and more financial security than it did before the law took effect.
it's about picking good leaders, he said. i see how different people come to congress. and some of them just play along with the system and do what they need to do to get re-elected, and some of them stand up and are willing to buck the system and do the right thing and vote for change.
another big difference between the harris and sanders proposals is the role of private insurance, which has become a flashpoint in the democratic primary debate.
at that time, fluke was part of a group of people on campus who were, as she described it, concerned about the lack of comprehensive reproductive health care coverage on our insurance for students. the group had explored a few avenues for speaking out, as well as the possibility of filing a lawsuit, but concluded that working through the affordable care act was the best path forward. they held a press conference at the national press club, which got the attention of lawmakers.
(politifact rated the claim that the ahca would not eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions as mostly false.)

but given that single-payer is staunchly opposed by republicans in washington and has struggled to get sufficient support even in california's democratic-controlled legislature, the more consequential action, for now, will likely be on three other parts of newsom's announcement.
they should text her, he said. she gives almost every member her cellphone number.
the conservatives filing the lawsuit had claimed that provision of the affordable care act was coercive to the states. in the initial conference, biskupic reports, the four liberals rejected that argument and roberts sided with them.

thirty-one states and the district of columbia have expanded eligibility for medicaid under obamacare, which has resulted in about 11 million people getting coverage. but under the republican bill, starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer provide federal funds for people who newly qualify under the expanded eligibility standards.
senators just adjourned for a break. back in 10 minutes.
simply being the first of something shouldn't be a goal in and of itself, even something as overdue as having a woman elected president of the united states. as you can see from the examples above, context and what the person actually achieves ultimately trumps being first. believe it or not, i very much want every person's mom, grandmother, daughter, and myself to see america's first female president -- but i want that woman to be an amazing progressive president who i can be proud of. and i'm not sure if hillary would be that president.
donning a polo shirt and jeans in a sea of hundreds of folks in suits and ties who he described as people with money, he knew he stood out. he also knew that it was important that he was present at this moment, especially after the backlash benedict had gotten for hosting the president. as trump spoke, king watched in a weird awe.
tuesday happened to be an especially good night for the left across the country, with progressive candidates upsetting establishment picks in maryland's gubernatorial primary and new york's 24th congressional district as well.
whether these differences between warren and sanders are more about strategy or substance, or maybe a little of both, is a matter about which even like-minded progressives can disagree. the same goes for how much these differences really matter.
the change is from va-centric to veteran-centric resulting in a system with both strong a va and a choice program. veterans are individuals and offering them choices will put them in charge, ultimately driving unprecedented engagement, better health outcomes and unmatched satisfaction with the va.

openly discussing sabotage of the insurance market doesn't seem like a good pr strategy for a party in full control of government that can't even accomplish their signature policy goal, said one senior democratic aide.
history has thrust one more urgent task on us. will we be the generation that finally wipes the stain of racism from our national character? biden said during his acceptance speech. i believe we're up to it.
we haven't expanded medicaid, for political reasons, a frustrated jones said of alabama in a phone interview last week. no one wanted to legitimize obamacare.
now the trump administration has undone all of that.
according to laron nelson, phd, fnp, an assistant professor of nursing at the university of rochester, the structure of the major studies responsible for the advent of prep did not prioritize investigating how truvada could most successfully address the pressing needs of black msm.
it's not clear if the extension would include caregiving leave; about 13 percent of californians who seek paid leave need it to look after sick spouses, partners, children or parents, according to the state's data.
it mattered little that the dating scene was disastrous; i'd been single for most of the decade since my ex ended our marriage over the phone. i preferred being on my own to being in a union that had any room for secrets.
as a former law professor whose research found that medical bills were a leading cause of household bankruptcies, warren is more interested in the details of technocratic fixes to the aca than are many medicare-for-all warriors like sanders. on thursday, she rattled off statistic after statistic demonstrating the success of the massachusetts health model, such as the fact that it has the second-lowest premiums in the aca market of any state in the country.
but partisans still must decide whether to vote. one reason hillary clinton lost in 2016 was that not enough of hers did. and then there are the less committed partisans ― the ones who don't lean so strongly in one direction or the other, who think about the previous four years and the next, and who ask themselves which candidate promises to be a more capable, responsible leader.
protecting people with preexisting conditions has always been among the affordable care act's most popular provisions, perhaps because it seems like such a basic principle of fairness: few people argue that somebody should have to pay higher insurance premiums, or lose access to it altogether, simply because they have a congenital condition, survived cancer or are living with the lingering effects of injury.
the federal government had historically limited ahps to small businesses in a common line of work, such as restaurant franchises. the trump administration decided last year to loosen those restrictions significantly, so that small employers with nothing in common other than geography could form ahps ― and so self-employed individuals could join as well.
democrats seemed ready to tear one another apart in 2020 over medicare for all, and republicans seemed eager to make political hay over those democratic efforts to end employer-based health insurance. but trump's threats to dismantle obamacare through the courts has united democrats, with even the most progressive lawmakers saying democrats should first shore up the affordable care act.
president donald trump is rooting for the case to succeed, even though an estimated 20 million people would lose insurance and, as usual, he doesn't have a replacement plan. at his behest, the justice department last week formally informed the 5th circuit that it, too, wants the whole law to come off the books.
the trump administration and several states have been promoting alternatives to obamacare″ coverage from the exchanges that some unemployed people may want to consider, such as short-term policies that can last up to a year.
crucially, western wayne also helps patients enroll in medicaid if they are eligible. and barnes was, because michigan is among the states that have expanded their programs through the affordable care act.
eventually the administration took more control of managing the crisis and at least one of its big initiatives, a big investment in vaccine development, seems likely to yield real relief soon. but that success always took place against the backdrop of trump's unscientific pronouncements on fighting the virus, from the hyping of hydroxychloroquine to the suggestion that injecting bleach was something to explore.
#2: place a freeze on non-starter debates.
trump said, i have done more for the african american community than any president since abraham lincoln. that is ludicrous. lyndon johnson, for one, signed the civil rights act and the voting rights act.
that same year, a rasmussen poll reported that 31 percent of texans said they believed texas had the right to secede but 3 in 4 texans said they did not support leaving the united states.
with trump's first 365 days down with, at best, limited successes, republicans confront a second year that is not merely challenging, but potentially devastating.
members of congress would run down the hall to the physician's office to be tested, jolly said. they would spray themselves before coming down here. this is the fear of floridians right here.
but barrett has a reputation as somebody unusually willing to disregard past precedents when such rulings are inconsistent with her vision of the constitution. that makes her votes in big cases difficult to project.
one of his advertisements features a sun-drenched shot of the family outside, with hawley's (adorable) little boy bouncing a ball in the air. we've got two perfect little boys ― just ask their mama, hawley says before mentioning the pre-existing condition. we know what that's like. i support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions.
white house chief of staff mark meadows told reporters that monday's event likely would be held outdoors.
since the ministries are not insurance companies, their members would be required to pay a fine every year for not having signed up for health insurance if the exemption were not in place.
if the gop's repeal bill fails, they can and should work with democrats to improve the aca, durbin spokesman marter said.
ruth bader ginsburg, who died friday at the age of 87, spent her life building a world in which women and men were on equal footing, at home and beyond. through careful, strategic legal work, first as a litigator and later as a supreme court justice, ginsburg helped turn the idea of gender equality into a fundamental right ― and she did it while raising two kids and facing down the same discrimination she spent her career dismantling.
rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, told huffpost on monday it's apparent that strides have been made to address real concerns raised by caucus members. he added: at first glance, it appears that medicaid issues are still very problematic.
private insurers have frequently lost money on their aca exchange plans, but they've profited handsomely from their participation in medicaid and medicare advantage.

the better care reconciliation act went down, 43-57, with nine republicans voting no: susan collins (maine), tom cotton (ark.), bob corker (tenn.), lindsey graham (s.c.), dean heller (nev.), mike lee (utah), jerry moran (kan.), lisa murkowski (alaska) and rand paul (ky.)
unfortunately, as i started my program in boston, i became sick again — experiencing the relapsing part of my incurable relapsing-remitting disease. i soon found myself at student health services, where a wonderful primary care doctor outlined a series of referrals and tests.
cruz added late tuesday night that the replacement plan he voted for would likely be the contours of a final bill.
we are prevailing, the president said, promising to deliver the first doses of a vaccine to seniors when it's ready.
her twitter timeline was one long screed that reflected the collective id of the make america great again movement. tea party rage, evangelical hokum and white supremacy ― it was all there. in sufficient volume, this kind of hate can now turn any no-account right-winger into a star on social media. and it worked for @amymek.
i can't give assurances on a specific hypothetical, kavanaugh said, adding that his declining to speak on the matter is consistent with how other nominees have discussed issues they may rule on in the future. an independent-minded judge, he argued, can't tip their hand before litigants have appeared in court.
gop repeal bills would have dramatically reduced that funding while giving states more leeway to limit enrollment, benefits or both ― even for people who had been enrolled in medicaid before the expansion. since that didn't work, republicans are now focusing on a narrower but still important change: requiring people who enroll through the expansion to demonstrate that they are working, that they are looking for work or that have a good reason why they are not.
the president likes to do things by trial and error, said ruddy, who said he predicted a big adjustment period after trump took office. he's not a strategic planner.
the administration has also backed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the entire law in the courts ― including its popular protections for people with preexisting protections ― without proposing an alternative plan if that does occur.
and it won't be good for their health or for the electoral prospects of the gop.
kim hicks, another republican who stood in line for the event, criticized macarthur for presenting himself as a moderate member of the gop.
yet with a large screen at their disposal, twitter users quickly developed a completely new plan — to jazz up ryan's presentation with their own photoshop magic.
the coronavirus pandemic and the recession that's very likely to hit the u.s. economy offer a case study in how this kind of financing scheme puts americans who earn very little at risk of getting sick or losing a job ― or both ― during a crisis.
the bill represents a starkly different vision for the health care system than embodied by the affordable care act. president barack obama's 2010 law expanded health coverage to 20 million previously uninsured people and slashed the share of americans without health insurance to an all-time low. the law targeted financial assistance to lower-income households and featured a slew of consumer protections, starting with an ironclad guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
democratic senators also pointed to kavanaugh's remarks at a march 2016 event at the american enterprise institute, in which he suggested overturning a 1988 high court ruling that upheld the law authorizing an independent counsel prosecutor. the statute, which was used to appoint kenneth starr, the independent counsel who probed president bill clinton, has since expired. asked at the event if he could think of a decision that ought to be overturned, kavanaugh directly named the ruling, morrison v. olson, and said he would put the final nail in it.
the outlook for any of these proposals in the state legislature is unclear. california has a history of aggressive action to help people get health care, up to and including its implementation of the affordable care act. but some of its more ambitious initiatives have failed because legislators could not agree on funding and the state constitution requires a two-thirds vote for new taxes.
the threat to these protections is from president trump and the republicans suing to end them, schumer wrote. we're fighting to stop it.
i would say the oil and gas industry are the biggest beneficiaries, hirono said.
i'm asking you guys to have some respect, he pleaded exasperatedly at one point.
in his remarks, inslee talked about the washingtonians who were grateful for the coverage they'd gotten from the affordable care act over the last few years ― and those who were still struggling, even with the law fully in place.
and in missouri, josh hawley, the state attorney general challenging incumbent democratic sen. claire mccaskill, has written and talked repeatedly about his oldest son, who has a rare chronic disease.
later, on fox news, trump said ― well, he said something. via sopan deb at cbs news:
but that change took place while steve beshear, a democratic governor enthusiastic about helping poor people get health insurance, was in charge. bevin, his successor and a loud critic of obamacare, campaigned on a promise to roll back the expansion. although he backed off that promise ― perhaps because many of those who supported him would have been among the hundreds of thousands losing coverage ― he has continued to suggest medicaid needs radical changes because, he says, it encourages dependency.
but a 2012 supreme court decision made it easy for state officials to reject the medicaid expansion and gop leaders in 17 states have done just that, even though the federal government picks up nearly all of the expansion's cost. (it's 18 states if you include maine gov. paul lepage, who refuses to carry out an expansion the state's voters approved by ballot initiative.) republican officials in a similar, overlapping list of states have done their best to undermine the private insurance reforms.
it's not just that biden's health care platform is less progressive than those of his rivals, especially sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), nor is it simply that biden holds centrist views about the value of competition and choice in the insurance market.
senator mitt romney, a rare republican critic of trump, urged colleagues on monday to vote for barrett, saying it would strengthen the court.
the second time i saw him, he came to a storytelling show i host. i doubted he'd make it, since it was late on a school night, but i was disappointed when i didn't see him. until he found me at intermission. your opening song was hilarious, he said.
if enacted, greenstein warned, it would produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern u.s. history,
at his press conference on wednesday, trump lamented that some obamacare plans carry very high deductibles that reduce their value for people who'd have to spend thousands of dollars out of pocket before their benefits kick in.
spending on prescription drugs in the u. s. rose to457 billion in 2015, one-sixth of total health care spending. (10)
entrepreneur shri thanedar is also running on a progressive platform. he spent at least $1.2 million on tv ads as of march — far more than his opponents — and has invested nearly $6 million of his own money into his campaign. however, thanedar's past political activity haunts him, including his donation to sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) in 2008, and his attendance at a 2016 rally supporting sen. marco rubio (r-fla.).
the affordable care act doesn't allow health insurance companies to charge older people more than three times the price for a younger adult. the house gop plan would increase that limit to five times, although states would have flexibility to set their own rules. this might mean lower premiums for some younger consumers, but older people could pay considerably more.

mb: the reality is that obamacare isn't working. it is killing the healthcare system. #kyelect — matt bevin (@mattbevin) october 27, 2015
in a speech on the senate floor announcing that his caucus would vote to move forward, schumer said he hadn't spoken with trump since their friday meeting at the white house ― before the government shut down. the great deal-making president sat on the sidelines, he said.
the company spent only 64 percent of the premiums it collected in its obamacare plans on medical care. a provision in the affordable care act requires that insurers spend at least 80 percent of monthly premium dollars for medical costs rather than on administration, marketing or profits. if that threshold isn't met, the company has to refund money. hcsc said in a statement that it would pay rebates consistent with federal law, axios reported.
taken together, the two steps ― getting rid of the mandate and then changing the rules on short-term plans ― could accelerate an evolution already underway for people buying insurance on their own, rather than through an employer.
it will be up to the state's department of health and human services to put in place the new system for beneficiaries to report their work status. but while michigan already has a well-developed online portal for public benefits, robert gordon, the new state secretary of health and human services, said he too worries about a replay of the arkansas experience ― with people losing coverage even when they are following the rules when it comes to employment.
an emotional sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) hugged son-in-law ben domenech and told him to take care of his daughter meghan, the arizona republic reported.

several democrats urged their supporters to keep resisting and organizing in the wake of a major gop health care defeat.
several analysts also suggested setting aside extra funds to help rural hospitals and others struggling to pay for operations. medicare already tailors payments based on regional costs, and a sanders aide made clear to huffpost a new system could add further modifications as necessary. there's no reason we can't adjust rates geographically, the aide said.
the other worry is that people joining the ministries do not fully grasp the limits on their coverage, discovering the truth only when they get sick and suddenly face steep medical bills.
the winneshiek county democratic party had its largest central committee meeting ever in january, with a third of the 40 attendees being people who had never attended a meeting, according to the county correspondence secretary.
he also hypocritically criticized democratic congresswomen for not donning american flag pins for the state of the union, despite not wearing one himself.
yeah, that's called the democratic primary election, pete. that's called an election, castro responded. this is what we're here for.
much of that is due to the gop health care bill drastically undermining those protections.
sen. patrick leahy, d-vt., asked what she thinks of trump's view that he can pardon himself.
this article has been updated with additional information about the court ruling and the background of the case and with statements from political leaders.
collins is one of the few gop senators who support abortion rights. luckily for planned parenthood, she and sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) sit on the committee, giving abortion rights supporters a majority. both collins and murkowski oppose the gag rule and sent a letter to health and human services secretary alex azar about it last year.
house republicans, led by speaker paul ryan (r-wis.), appear to be putting the finishing touches on the legislative vehicle with which they intend to eliminate former president barack obama's signature health care law and put in place a new system ― one that would provide significantly less funding for people seeking health benefits and for states providing medicaid coverage. ryan has said that he hopes the house can begin advancing legislation when it comes back from recess next week.
they need that ninth justice, that's why it has to be hurried, durbin said.
this is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable, buttigieg said after the former san antonio mayor's exchange with biden.
when sen. orrin hatch (r-utah) asked kavanaugh for his views on diversity in legal circles, he noted that most of the nominee's clerks have been women. kavanaugh said he believes in equality and has been very aggressive about hiring the best, and understanding that the best include women.
in a surprise announcement, president donald trump tweeted friday that rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.) is his new white house chief of staff.
medicare for america envisions creating a comprehensive public insurance plan that would automatically absorb at least half the u.s. population and be open to anybody who wanted to enroll. but the measure would allow employers to keep offering private coverage, giving employees of those firms the option of sticking with a company plan. it would also preserve medicare advantage, the privately run version of traditional medicare that roughly one-third of seniors currently use.
the coverage would be more generous than what the affordable care act requires but, still, less generous than what medicare for all would provide. in the bills from sanders and jayapal, nobody would pay individual premiums and nobody would pay out-of-pocket costs, regardless of their incomes, except for token copayments on some name-brand prescription drugs. financing for the system would come entirely from taxes.
that's why even the insurance industry ― which got a lot of what it asked for from the trump administration in this regulation ― isn't satisfied. the cost-sharing reductions are the industry's most pressing concern, and trump's comments wednesday that he might end them have heightened anxiety about what the exchanges will look like next year.
the case prevailed before u.s. district judge reed o'connor in 2018. the democratic officials, who are defending the law because the trump administration won't, appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit. last month, two judges from a three-judge panel of the 5th circuit upheld key elements of o'connor's ruling, including his finding that the mandate was unconstitutional.
the ahca would have allowed states to waive those protections if they set up high-risk pools for the sick to get coverage. the big problem with such a plan, however, was that the republican bill drastically underfunded those high-risk pools.
naturally, all of those features would come with trade-offs ― like more disruption, swapping private payments for taxes, more government influence over a big section of the economy ― that might not appeal to all democrats, let alone all americans.
u.s. department of justice lawyers pressed the supreme court on friday not to expedite a decision on the affordable care act that could end up delaying donald trump's hoped-for death of the health care system until after the presidential election.
that last part is important because, traditionally, it's been the most difficult link for researchers to establish. and even now the evidence that the affordable care act has improved health is far from definitive. but several studies point very strongly in that direction.
no one benefits from not allowing these millions of americans to get health coverage in the midst of a pandemic that has practically shut down the nation. there is no upside to the trump administration's decision.
right now, democrats appear to be at each other's throats. however, it's highly likely that a month from now, the party will come together just as it did in 2008. the fight this fall will be between two candidates, yes, but also two vastly different understandings of our national narrative, of the course of our development over the past several decades and, in particular, the last eight years.
at some basic level, you could say that the problem started with insurance, but that's not to say that insurance is a bad thing. what those insurance policies did was to separate the payment from the services, and in the early days, we became blind to what was paid because we didn't pay it ourselves. up until a couple decades ago, if you had good insurance, your insurer pretty much paid everything. now, that's not the case anymore because people have higher co-pays and higher deductibles, and suddenly they're saying, whoa, how did things get so expensive? this allowed the system to become so costly, because consumers didn't notice for a long time.
when a trump-supporting woman stepped out of line for a brief moment to continue the verbal sparring she'd been conducting with a female protester, a young man from the anti-trump forces presented himself inches from her face, and called her a skank. a couple of people oohed and then got back to the business of spewing their own animosities.
now, trump is all they've got. their tax law, benefiting the wealthy and corporations, went nowhere in galvanizing voters for the midterms (many having likely seen it for the scam that it is). according to a recent fox news poll, it's now more unpopular (40 percent) than obamacare (51 percent). vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric, always a desperate last resort, only hurt the gop in virginia's 2017 gubernatorial and legislative races and in special elections across the country.
this will likely be a point that is criticized, but … i actually think the timeline is the most realistic for moving a country toward something like medicare for all, kavita patel, a physician, brookings fellow, and former obama administration official, told huffpost. patel, with whom the campaign shared its proposal beforehand, said, senator harris is clearly trying to lay out a more pragmatic version of medicare for all.
but as well-known as he was in new jersey, rodney frelinghuysen would have been battling a difficult political climate. frelinghuysen was a key vote for the gop obamacare repeal in the house, though he initially helped sink the first repeal attempt when he came out against it, and he was unable to significantly change the gop tax bill, which would raise taxes on a number of his constituents by scaling back deductions on state and local taxes.
in a rational world, this record of success would inspire enthusiasm and support for the medicaid expansion ― not just from democrats, who have always believed in government-sponsored health care, but also from republicans, who have proclaimed over and over again their determination to stop the opioid epidemic.
1. donald j. trump, president of the united states. last week's ranking: duh
anthem argued that there was enough competition because large companies with more than 5,000 employees often used multiple smaller players in the national market, but the judge disagreed.
gop lawmakers voted to defund, change or repeal parts of the law at least 67 times while president barack obama was in office, and they promised voters that if they won control of the white house, they'd make the dream of full repeal come true.
the congressional budget office concluded in its summary of the legislation that those with pre-existing conditions would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all.
among the ipab's most vocal champions were president barack obama and his economic advisers, who, contrary to popular opinion, were serious about crafting health care legislation that would offset new spending with cuts. they also hoped that controlling costs in medicare would encourage the entire health care system to become more efficient in ways that would ultimately save everybody money.
trump and mccain had several public spats before the senator died. trump in 2015 infamously mocked mccain's five-year internment as a prisoner of war during the vietnam war, saying that because he was captured he wasn't a war hero.
with johnson on the top of the ticket instead of pawlenty, national republicans are less enthusiastic about the race. it's unclear if the rga will spend heavily to back johnson the way they likely would have supported pawlenty. that's good news for the democratic nominee, u.s. rep. tim walz. minnesota was perhaps republicans' best chance to pick up a gubernatorial seat in 2018 ― democrat mark dayton is leaving after eight years in office, and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton had won the state by just 1.5 percentage points two years ago.
the sartorial choices of trump's younger-leaning, mostly male fans who turned out for the event ranged from cutoff t-shirts and shorts to full suits and ties.
oddly, 89 percent of canova's large donor money comes from out of state, compared with 28 percent for wasserman schultz -- the reverse of the usual pattern with incumbents and challengers. that's due to the publicity canova has drawn by trying to unseat the high-profile incumbent, noted smith. canova has a national profile by extension of his proxy war against the dnc and debbie wasserman schulz, smith said.
you have deductibles that are so high that after people go broke paying their premiums ― which are going through the roof ― the health care can't even be used by them because the deductibles are so high, trump said.
zann nelson — who is 70, lives in reva, va., and was sued by uva for $23,849 a few years ago — is a rare patient who fought back. admitted with a newly diagnosed uterine cancer, she was bleeding and in pain when she signed an open-ended payment agreement. in court, she argued it was so vague as to be unenforceable. (c-ville weekly, a local paper, wrote about her case in 2014.)
democrats, meanwhile, are trying just as hard to make sure the voters remember what trump and his allies actually tried to do on health care. part of that effort will be a focus on the issue during the democratic national convention that begins ― virtually ― on monday.
it was never true, not for a second. like on most issues, trump has never displayed an understanding of what ails the health care system or how to fix it, nor is he guided by any particular principles beyond self-preservation.
i personally think he should be more focused on accuracy, ruddy added. because i think it would be better for him in the long run.
rich people run companies that need healthy, educated workers. they have children they want to see safe and loved by healthy peers. they have all the incentives they need to be good citizens. the real disconnect is about who decides which projects take priority and how they're structured — the best answers to which will always involve some interplay and compromise.
the gop repeal bill would make access worse
pennsylvania gov. tom wolf (d) told the huffington post that he's sent individualized letters to each member of the delegation detailing the consequences for their districts and state of taking obamacare off the books: chief among them being 700,000 pennsylvanians potentially losing their coverage, community hospitals facing a massive financial crunch and a drop in services for those dealing with substance abuse. for the past few weeks, wolf has also barnstormed the state, meeting with health care officials and constituents dependent on the law, to discuss what a post-obamacare landscape would look like. it is those conversations ― and the subsequent ability to convey the real-world impact of repeal ― he said, that made him and other governors effective advocates for trying to keep parts (if not all) of obamacare in place.
the goal of the october tour is to highlight gop house members' support for the $1.2 trillion tax cut law, which is unpopular in public opinion polling. critics have assailed the law for increasing the budget deficit and income inequality. the law remains popular in some republican-leaning states and with the gop's donor class but hasn't proven to be the midterm winner many gop operatives hoped.
medical assistance with disability qualifying limit is 100% of the poverty level, or $990 per month, and an asset limit of $3,000
julián castro's attack on biden over the obama administration's deportations of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, in particular, marked a new shift in the campaign. biden suggested that the former housing secretary's push to decriminalize border crossings ― which would remain a civil violation but would prevent a future administration from separating families at the border ― was unnecessary to fix the immigration system.
one of them is america's health insurance plans, the largest trade organization representing insurers. while we are reviewing the proposed rule to understand its impact on the people we serve, we remain concerned that expanded use of short-term policies could further fragment the individual market, which would lead to higher premiums for many consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions, kristine grow, group's senior vice president for communications, said on tuesday.
but pelosi owes much of her power to progressives. they never made an issue out of the california democrat's history of taking corporate pac donations, and pelosi quickly locked up their support during the speaker's race, even though high-profile democrats like ocasio-cortez had initially wavered on pelosi. with the more liberal wing behind her, pelosi was able to define her opposition as a group of white, moderate men, which in turn put pressure on those democrats to get behind her.
sen. kevin cramer (r-n.d.) said he, too, hoped for a transitional period allowing congress time to pass a fix if obamacare is ultimately struck down.
trump campaigned 'friday in florida and georgia, neighboring states he carried four years ago and must win again to extend his presidency. his decision to devote friday evening's prime-time slot to georgia in particular highlighted the serious nature of his challenge: far from his original plan to expand into democratic-leaning states, he is laboring to stave off a defeat of major proportions.
abrams' bipartisan tendencies, which date back to her time in the state legislature, have long generated suspicion among some progressives, even as journalists have often painted her as part of the party's left wing. but abrams surpassed expectations in a way that democratic candidates who ran more left-leaning campaigns — like florida's andrew gillum, arizona's david garcia and maryland's ben jealous — weren't able to.
to sandy praeger, all of these options sound like a bad idea. praeger is both a card-carrying republican and the state's former insurance commissioner. although well aware of the affordable care act's shortcomings, she remembers what it was like before the law took effect.
those policies have included expanding paid parental leave and sick time, emphasizing gender equality in parenting and reducing some of the costs associated with having children. (there have also been some misses -- family policy advocates pointed to the administration's continued deportation raids targeting mothers and children as a major disappointment.)
the senate on wednesday rejected a democratic effort to overturn trump administration regulations allowing cheaper health insurance options that exclude key benefits under the affordable care act and aren't generally available to people with preexisting conditions.
slavitt maintains that it is not his intention to get in the way of the medicare for all movement, and he sees his work as a complement rather than a substitute for all kinds of universal health care advocacy.
congressional democrats have stopped short of saying the law should be repealed, probably since doing so would mean slightly less take-home pay for most workers.
so-called mainstream republicans competed to fan the flames of outrage, poisoning political discourse. typical was the establishment's darling, marco rubio, who claimed that obama was not simply wrong, but trying to destroy america as we know it. republican politics became not faith-based, but hate-based.
democrats are, of course, hoping mueller will make the conclusions he has painstakingly avoided. but they're also realistic that he probably won't. instead, they said, their no. 1 goal is to just get mueller to talk about the findings of his report.
carson announced he won't attend the fox news gop debate on thursday in detroit, and said he would further discuss his political plans at the conservative political action conference in national harbor, maryland, on friday.
we see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms, said david bergstein, spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee. the republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.
a recent study found that the annual cost of a decent american health insurance plan rose to a record of more than $20,000 last year, the equivalent of buying an economy each year, bloomberg reported.
senior advocacy group opposes gop health care proposal | huffpost politics
it's an outlandish request that relies on what even the law's longtime critics are calling an outlandish argument. jonathan adler, the case western law professor who was an architect of the last big lawsuit challenging the affordable care act's constitutionality, says the case's theory is unmoored and absurd. lamar alexander, the tennessee republican and chairman of the senate's health committee, has called it far-fetched.
in a tweet wednesday morning, trump claimed, falsely, that mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.
below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our conversation.
biden's first words to harris as she approached him on stage during the opening moments of the debate on wednesday were: go easy on me, kid. she didn't.
the dnc showed itself to be a bought party in how it treated bernie sanders in 2016. perhaps he would have lost anyway, but that hardly matters to his supporters. those who held the strings were more interested in forcing their agenda than listening to the people. if the central duty of party leadership is to amplify those voices which best address the concerns and hopes of the majority, the democratic party isn't doing so great right now.
the affordable care act will still get a robust defense on wednesday. it will come from a team of lawyers led by xavier becerra, attorney general of california, and 16 other state democratic officials who stepped in when the trump administration wouldn't. when the time comes, they will square off with the gop's lawyers over some familiar subjects: pre-existing conditions and the individual mandate.
the challenge is you have to be able to negotiate, and you can't have 200-some members negotiating, he said.
it isn't legislation, she said. maybe when they ever decide to write legislation, they'll get a score on how much it's going to cost, how many people will lose coverage, and we can make a judgement about it.
insurers say they're consolidating in order to reap economies of scale. but there's little evidence that large size generates cost savings.
the sept. 26 rose garden ceremony at which trump named barrett to succeed the late liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg preceded a wave of covid-19 cases among top republicans including trump and first lady melania trump. the president spent three nights hospitalized receiving covid-19 treatment.
washington ― president-elect donald trump seems concerned about his party's strategy for repealing the affordable care act, at least according to a series of tweets he posted on wednesday.
every time you guys sit down and negotiate … that is in the midst of every labor negotiation, sanders said. with medicare for all, you can sit down and negotiate decent wage increases.
elections have consequences, as the saying goes. and sometimes elections are the consequences.
ryan's ideas for those programs built on the concept of welfare reform legislation congress passed in 1996, which put a lid on federal funding and delegated more authority to states ― ultimately resulting in far fewer eligible americans receiving benefits. ryan had worked on capitol hill as a staffer at the time.
that's not good enough for the sullivan campaign, which has been attacking gross as if he still supports the policy.
even a proposed border adjustment tax on foreign imports, an idea favored by trade hawks, ended up on the cutting room floor. and because trump failed to crack down on the financial sector's greediest practices, corporations used his mammoth tax cuts to engage in a record-breaking spree of stock buybacks instead of using their savings to boost worker pay or reinvest in their companies.
the number of people without health coverage would begin growing almost right away, as the cbo expects 4 million people to cancel their plans once the individual mandate's penalties disappeared. in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured. in 2019, 16 million more. in 2020, 21 million more. and at the end of the cbo's 10-year analysis, 24 million fewer people would be covered than under current law.
mary kay henry, the president of the service employees international union, told huffpost ahead of the forum that she was waiting to see the whole field of candidates put forth bold ideas that would advance collective bargaining.
house majority leader steny hoyer (d-md.) on tuesday expressed skepticism about the trump administration's willingness to work in good faith on either issue.
look, the whole world has this, except for the united states, said ruth milkman, a sociology professor at the graduate center of the city university of new york and a co-author of a book analyzing california's leave policy. this is not some utopian proposal. in the u.s. it would be a breakthrough.
bloomberg via getty images president donald trump reportedly instructed the justice department, which already endorsed a lawsuit against the affordable care act, to support calls for invalidating the whole statute.
how is medication abortion helpful in the face of a hostile and political environment for abortion providers? abortion pills are more private, more portable, and offer more flexibility in timing. the pills are also less medically invasive than performing a traditional in-office abortion procedure. it has been proven internationally in countries like india, mozambique, and ethiopia that women can be provided these medications by nurse midwives, pharmacists, and other less traditional means and are then able to use them successfully and safely as an alternative to a mandatory visit to the physician's office. if abortion providers continue to lose ground due to political opposition in the u.s., these experiences overseas may be a helpful path for ongoing access to abortion care for women in our own country.
president donald trump hit joe biden with a familiar attack in thursday night's presidential debate, warning that the former vice president would wipe out private health insurance for 180 million americans.
seema verma, the agency's administrator, said the policy guidance came in response to requests from at least 10 states that have proposed requiring some medicaid recipients to work or participate in activities that may include skills training, education, job search, volunteering or caregiving. those states include kentucky, maine, new hampshire, arizona, indiana and utah.
that level would be twice what the traditional medicare program currently pays, according to the plan. at that level, buttigieg advisers said, doctors and hospitals couldn't charge as much to privately insured patients as they do today. they also wouldn't be able to hit patients with surprise bills for out-of-network medical care, an issue making headlines lately.
under the affordable care act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. people with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford ― even in california, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country.
conservatives are preparing for a showdown on abortion rights following president donald trump's nomination last week of 48-year-old amy coney barrett to fill the position made vacant by justice ruth bader ginsburg's death on sept. 18. barrett is an appellate court judge who once clerked for the late justice antonin scalia.
let's break that down. first, it's been two weeks. have you seen a health care plan? has trump? just weeks before that, health and human services secretary alex azar admitted they have no plan. that's because there isn't one and there never has been. second, the supreme court ruling on the deferred action for childhood arrival immigration program ― daca ― did no such thing.
critics also say that since the ministries are not regulated, there is no guarantee members will be compensated, and if there is a disagreement they are not allowed to sue their group.
political circumstances are different now. democrats hold the house majority and, as speaker nancy pelosi's office confirmed to the washington post on thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on medicare for all this year. exactly what those hearings will entail isn't clear ― democratic leaders aren't saying ― but one focus will be a bill that rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.
on thursday, the republican politician called supporters of the affordable care act, otherwise known as obamacare, the stupidest, dumbass people i've ever met, according to salt lake city station kstu.
to make sure people didn't simply wait until getting sick before enrolling, the law included a financial penalty (the individual mandate) for people who declined to get insurance. it also set a fixed, open enrollment period that looked a lot like the ones employers used for their company policies.
when mcconnell was asked about the legislation tuesday, during a time of massive unemployment and more than 1,000 deaths a day due to the coronavirus, he had a simple message.
in the dead of night, the trump administration has once again asked the supreme court to rip away the protections and benefits of the affordable care act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. #protectourcare https://t.co/ib0oglimdv — nancy pelosi (@speakerpelosi) june 26, 2020
for years, slavitt had enjoyed a technocrat's exemption from personal political drama. the 51-year-old minnesotan founded a successful digital health care company, held a top post at a health insurance giant and went on to lead the rescue of the affordable care act's website.
it's totally plausible that this bill has no effect on public opinion relative to baseline, political scientist jonathan ladd tweeted tuesday. but that's with our baseline being [that republicans] are behind in the congressional generic ballot by around 10 points. and that's a margin that should make republicans nervous.
that resistance so far has largely failed to materialize. while health care tops the list of americans' biggest concerns, recent polling suggests, the supreme court currently lags near the bottom ― and while hillary clinton voters in the presidential election rallied strongly against the health care bill, which trump voters supported only tepidly, the intensity gap seems to be reversed when it comes to gorsuch's confirmation.
pelosi was not impressed. in terms of the bonus that corporate america received versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic, she said last month.
chivas michael, a prep navigator at crescentcare health in new orleans, recalls the chilling words of an african-american client whose grandmother picked cotton as a sharecropper: he said, 'my grandmother told me that when you were sick, you were taken out to the back like a mule and shot.'
health insurance exchange policies tend to be expensive without subsidies, as are insurance plans purchased directly from an insurance company. the average price of the benchmark mid-level silver plans sold on exchanges like healthcare.gov is $462 a month this year, and those policies can have deductibles in the thousands of dollars that must be paid before full coverage kicks in.
if this weren't enough to convince rational people to do what most other advanced nations have done – create a single-payer system that insures everyone, funded by taxpayers – consider that america's giant health insurers are now busily consolidating into ever-larger behemoths.
the bill included language promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions and prohibited insurers from denying coverage outright. republicans like bishop mention this constantly. but, as numerous independent analysts pointed out, that provision wouldn't provide much protection when insurers could manipulate prices and benefits in ways that made it difficult or impossible for people with serious conditions to get insurance that paid for the care they need.
the republican congress has also done its part. last year, it passed a tax bill effectively eliminating the individual mandate, the financial penalty for people who don't get insurance. trump promptly signed it, removing a key pillar of the affordable care act that, although unpopular even with many democrats, encouraged healthy people to get coverage and ultimately kept premiums from going higher.
only arkansas saw a bigger decline in its uninsured rate among the states, as kentucky went from 20.4 percent of residents without health insurance in 2013 to 7.5 percent in 2015, according to gallup. and keeping the medicaid expansion and kynect have been popular in surveys, even though kentuckians think poorly of the affordable care act itself.
some might delay retirement to keep employer-sponsored insurance, corlette suggested.
the now-repealed fines enforce the law's insurance requirement, and without them the rest of the law cannot pass constitutional muster, the administration wrote.
the new law — 878 pages long — was designed to simplify the tax code, make it fairer, and incentivize growth. but its main thrust was true reform – cleaning out many of the special loopholes and breaks that had crept into the code over the years. it raised the tax on capital gains, but also cut the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. it pulled in $24 billion from corporations by adjusting tax shelters, while cutting corporate taxes from 46 percent to 34 percent. (the rate later crept up to 35 percent). and it shrank the number of individual tax brackets from 15 to five.
in one example, the boeing company had established a lactation program at its production facility in everett, washington, where mothers could sign onto the company's internal website and reserve a room to pump. each room came equipped with a lock, a chair and a refrigerator to store milk. the problem workers encountered was high demand ― 20 women were all trying to use a limited number of nursing spaces. the worker who filed the complaint said she wasn't able to pump when she needed to.
it's true -- i'm a man, and i've never lived through the sexism, inequalities, and discrimination that women are faced with every day. while i am a staunch feminist and very much want america to have its first woman president, i understand that it could never mean as much to me as it would to most women. i also have no daughters, both of my grandmothers are dead, and i'm optimistic that my mom will see a female american president in her lifetime. i will totally concede that hillary is more of a woman than bernie could ever be, and i think hillary would probably be slightly better on women's issues than bernie would.
i appreciate that this conclusion is depressing. no doubt many of you will object to some aspect of my indictment. fair enough. but i doubt that you are much inclined to dispute most of its particulars -- if only because you've acknowledged them yourselves.
the proposed repeal of obamacare proved deeply unpopular once voters realized that promises of an adequate replacement were false. it's easy to forget now, but trump as a candidate promised, i am going to take care of everybody. i don't care if it costs me votes or not. everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.
trump's justice department declined to defend the affordable care act in court, a break with standard practice when federal laws are subject to legal challenges. moreover, the trump administration actually joined with its state counterparts in seeking to invalidate the law in june 2018. at first, the administration only sought to have the courts undo the affordable care act's protections for people with preexisting conditions and some related provisions, but later it signed on to the state officials' goal of eliminating the whole statute.
the exchanges require full-­service health insurance policies with minimum coverages that are set forth that are very comprehensive, she said.
in addition, snatching away health care coverage from as many as 30 million people risks a public backlash against republicans, especially since large numbers of americans in states that trump won are covered by obamacare programs. democrats plan to stage events around the country on jan. 15 to highlight the law's benefits and the risks of taking them away.
i'm not that concerned about it, because we said we were going to repeal all the obamacare taxes, ryan said. this is one of the obamacare taxes.
my whole career, i've been able to get a lot of things done. i know i've been criticized by some on the far left because i think, actually, we should work with republicans. joe biden to the international brotherhood of electrical workers
in afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups, including the taliban. as we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement ― but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.

fox is a huge factor in trump's sustained level of support among republicans, said norman ornstein, a scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute. it has consistently provided an alternative universe, and its impact resonates with that core of trump supporters who keep republican lawmakers from confronting the truth.
paul said he liked trump's economic policies better, which struck me as ill-informed. i ranted at him about said policies, but still didn't cut off the conversation.
and he said that biden's plan would eliminate america's borders. no, just no. it's wrong.
let's not make any mistake about it, said california sen. kamala harris, the democratic vice presidential nominee, appearing remotely due to covid concerns. allowing trump to fill the seat with barrett poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country, harris said.
when the supreme court and the economy were on the line, tim pawlenty stuck his finger in the wind, johnson said direct-to-camera in a television ad attacking pawlenty. i'll lead on principle, not polling.
you said the proof will be in the pudding. what would the pudding look like in a few of the states where united states of care is going to be active?
as a result, newman lost several political consultants and several direct mail firms. despite that, newman repeatedly out-fundraised lipinski.
blue cross has not said much about other measures on the legislature's agenda, including bills that would make it easier for people to buy other forms of coverage (such as so-called short-term/limited-duration coverage and association health plans) that would not be subject to the same regulations as affordable care act plans ― and which, thanks to regulatory changes from the trump administration, allows states to open wider enrollment. one possible reason for the different tone: blue cross could sell these sorts of plans.
the open enrollment period will be half as long as originally proposed. sign-ups for 2018 health coverage will run from nov. 1 to dec. 15, 2017, instead of going until jan. 31, 2018. this could make it more difficult to spread the word about enrollment and provide assistance in signing up. the administration argues it will prevent people from waiting until they get sick to buy policies, something they have more time to do during a longer enrollment period.
the budget sets the course for a future of continued american dominance and prosperity, trump said in a message accompanying the document.
the meaning and significance of these recollections are open to interpretation. health care was not an issue on which biden had particular expertise, and during the administration's first year he was preoccupied with managing the 2009 economic stimulus package known as the recovery act, among other things.
sure, slamming biden is likely to please progressives eager for the other candidates to knock the delawarean from his perch atop the polls. the response to castro's comments, even in the immediate hours after the debate, illustrates the risks of throwing punches in a primary, especially when the other candidate has an extensive network of surrogates and allies like biden does. the debate had barely ended when former chicago mayor rahm emanuel was on national television calling castro mean and vindictive. expect similar commentary from other obama administration alumni with fond feelings for the former vice president.
she also insisted her alliance with trump was more than one of convenience and touted his economic stewardship. arizona voters, she predicted, are going to have the question: am i better off than i was two years ago? and the answer is very clear.
one path forward is to have the government get more involved in the pricing of prescription drugs. every other developed country in the world does this in one form or another.
what might happen if her seat remains vacant
washington ― if president donald trump and republicans make good on their promise to angry rural voters to repeal and replace the affordable care act, those voters may wind up a lot angrier.
although it got a favorable ruling from a federal district judge in texas, it is currently before the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals. if it gets past the 5th circuit, it would almost certainly go before the u.s. supreme court, which has already turned away two major challenges to the 2010 health care law. and those cases were widely viewed as more serious than this one.
for harrison, a former top aide to house majority whip jim clyburn who also led the south carolina democratic party, the contours of the senate race couldn't be more different. on the trail, he speaks often about growing up in poverty in orangeburg and access to health care, citing closures of rural hospitals and the threat to obamacare from a republican lawsuit that has reached the supreme court. he's also focused on expanding broadband internet access and fixing crumbling schools and bridges.
kentucky isn't the only state that wants to impose these kinds of restrictions on medicaid. nearly a dozen states have similar requests sitting in washington, awaiting approval from the trump administration that they're almost certain to get. more could follow soon.
finally, trump will declare his popularity unanimous and stay on for the third term in the highest office in our land.
other contested measures that will likely also fall to the wayside include gun control and a reform of how sexual harassment claims are handled on capitol hill.
moore has at least twice equated hydraulic fracturing, or fracking ― a technique used to extract oil and gas that has been known to contaminate drinking water ― to the loftiest of medical breakthroughs.
financial assistance for people buying coverage would change dramatically. instead of tax credits that vary based on income, people would be eligible for tax credits that vary based on age, with older customers getting bigger credits.

the proposals getting attention today address these problems directly. some call for making subsidies available to all people buying coverage on their own, so that nobody has to pay more than a fixed portion of their income. (in warren's bill, the cap is 8.5 percent of income.) other proposals envision new twists on the public option, like opening up medicaid to people who can't find private coverage that fits their budgets.
in another exchange, macarthur cast his role in helping craft the bill as not allowing perfect be the enemy of the good ― arguing that members of congress don't always vote on the bill they wish was in front of them. but the line failed to quell his constituents, who booed and shouted him down once more.
sometimes, biden seems to understand this. for more than a decade, he's warned audiences that this is not your father's republican party. but he still seems determined to work with republicans, arguing that trump is an aberration from the party's history.
testosterone drugs for men are widely marketed by the drug industry, claiming their own research shows no adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, but major studies over the last 30 years have documented an increase of more than 50 percent of these events among men taking these drugs.

there are turning points that broke against democrats and blocked them from an even larger majority. in wisconsin, former sen. russ feingold was heavily favored to reclaim his seat from gop incumbent ron johnson in 2016, but fell short. poor ballot design in broward county, florida, may have cost democratic sen. bill nelson his seat in 2018.
we have a state run insurance exchange. it's working well for us. there are a lot of lives at stake, with regard to decisions that are made here, sandoval said at an event hosted by the national governors association near capitol hill.

in exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult medicaid enrollees.
the truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, i never believed what [dick] cheney and [george w.] bush said about iraq, sanders said to biden. you're right, the former vice president responded, as many in the audience cheered.
he's sort of got the cart before the horse. you need to have a plan for what a replacement would be that would improve upon the aca, collins said of trump's push for repeal.
under medicare for america, people who end up in the public plan, whether by default or by choice, would pay no premiums and no out-of-pocket costs as long as their incomes were below twice the poverty line, which is roughly $50,000 for a family of four. people with higher incomes would be responsible for premiums and copayments, albeit on a sliding scale.

to be clear, that is 18 percent above and beyond any other premium increases.
altman, from pennsylvania, frequently cites a story about a woman who bought a short-term plan, had a stroke, and discovered belatedly that her $250,000 in hospital bills far exceed the $40,000 cap from her policy.
you can't look at 70 years of history and say, oh, he's going to be transformed when he gets a new job, unruh said. she added that many in her former party saw in trump's unformed political history an opportunity to mold a rubber stamp for whatever they wanted. they truly thought they could control him like a puppet. the agenda has come to a screeching halt because of the chaos.
the policy change that hhs unveiled on monday is a perfect example of how the ruse works. technically, the trump administration merely rewrote some regulatory guidance, which sounds innocuous enough. seema verma, the administration official in charge of federal health plans, went out of her way to say the changes would not hurt people with pre-existing conditions.
like everything else in obamacare, ipab has become politically toxic among conservatives ― even though, conceptually, it is similar to ideas that many of them, including now-house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.), once endorsed. the hostility traces at least as far back as 2010, shortly after the affordable care act became law, when former gop vice presidential nominee sarah palin likened ipab to a death panel that would ration care to the poor and sick. (she'd originally used the label to describe a different provision of the law only to decide later it actually applied to both.)
the parallel has become especially popular among warren's critics on the socialist left. simon narode, a college student in eugene, oregon, who supports sanders, compiled a viral video highlighting similarities in the two candidates' public statements about medicare for all over time.
and there is a lot to do, democrats realize.
as for warren, thompson appreciates the massachusetts senator's willingness to oppose the status quo in washington. it seems like she wants to go against the grain of what's always been in washington.
indeed, the past is looming over the governor's race. the major question is whether terry mcauliffe, the former democratic governor who remains incredibly popular in the state, will jump in. he has made it clear that he's still considering the move.
what the polls say about health care
the shift means that democrats can focus more on the conversation they wanted, and were trying to have, all along. it's the conversation about how to fix the affordable care act's shortcomings, in order to realize its ultimate goal of universal coverage.
the insult came after hatch referred to that wonderful bill called 'obamacare.'
predictably, romney's statement of the obvious about the atrocity of the trump presidency has been hailed for its supposed courage and principle. cnn called romney's words scathing. on twitter, vox's ezra klein pronounced romney's op-ed meaningful and a real risk. and msnbc promptly hailed romney and sen. ben sasse (r-neb.) as the senate's new generation of mavericks.
if that blithering idiot appears on the screen, i now mute the tv.
there was no real benefit to releasing a budget like this, other than delighting fiscal hawks at gop think tanks — a fact that makes the proposal seem like an unforced error by the trump administration. the ideas laid out in this document aren't going to become law. the words president's budget request and dead on arrival are mentioned together so much that it's almost a joke at this point, and legislators don't seem to have any interest in putting together a new budget this year.
but wiping out private insurance would also mean ending the insurance arrangements that the majority of americans now have, either through their employers or through medicare advantage, which is the private insurance option for seniors on medicare.
for black people and other people of color, like my mother, it validated their lifetimes of hardship and abuse and neglect by this country, even as we have been as patriotic or more patriotic than our white sisters and brothers. it meant that elusive american dream had come one giant leap forward. it meant, for the first time, that when children of color went to school, they would no longer see images solely of white male presidents of the united states, but now someone who could be them, and they, him.

the republican senator is being squeezed from all sides as the election nears ― from his left by a well-funded democratic opponent, jaime harrison, an unexpected sensation who hopes a changing electorate and energized black voters will help turn south carolina into a purple state. and from his right, allies of donald trump, who say he's not a true believer committed to defending the president and investigating his opponents.
will you campaign for democrats in the 2018 midterms?
federal reserve economic data (fred)/federal reserve bank of st. louis official data shows the nationally unemployment rate dropping steadily from the beginning of former president barack obama's term until the onset of the pandemic.
the public option has come to be seen as the moderate proposal, because of all the attention to medicare for all, but it would represent one of the largest expansions of the social welfare state in modern history. it could even include some aggressive efforts to control prices, although it would depend on the specific design.
those democrats, even the ones who may personally believe in medicare for all, seem to be very cautious about getting too far in front of their constituents.
if that happens, 20 million people could lose coverage, according to projections from the urban institute.
sanders has spent more time in the senate, and his success under the chamber's existing rules could give him reason to be skeptical of the need to kill the filibuster. working with sen. mike lee (r-utah), he was able to invoke the war powers resolution and persuade the senate to end american support for saudi arabia's war with yemen. (trump later vetoed the legislation.) and working with mccain, he was able to pass a bipartisan bill to reform the department of veterans' affairs.
thus, the proposed fix for the disagreement in zubik would leave all of these employees without birth control benefits -- a scenario that would directly contradict congress' intent.
they settled on a reform framework that kept overall spending under $1 trillion, at least for the first 10 years, and more than paid for itself with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.
that leaves grizzled tax policy veterans like trier pessimistic about the future of changes in this congress, or for many to come. this legislation, in significant parts, it could be fixed; it would not be that hard, he said. the problem is that with all the partisanship, it won't occur.
progressives have also stayed in line on a number of other potential flashpoints. when democratic leadership decided not to censure rep. steve king (r-iowa) ― instead offering a resolution so watered down that king himself voted for it ― hardly anyone spoke up. (one of the only members who did speak out was the only member who voted against the resolution, longtime democratic rep. bobby rush of illinois, who authored an actual censure resolution against king.)
just nine years ago, the democrats who wrote the affordable care act included specific provisions denying undocumented immigrants access to the health insurance policies sold on the law's exchange marketplaces, even if they want to spend their own money on them.
in other words, most experts would say, the types of changes the researchers expect ― higher premiums for comprehensive coverage, more uninsured, higher federal spending ― are almost certain to happen. it's just a question of how big the effects are.
if it's no big deal for the rest of the aca to exist without the mandate, which will happen for the rest of the litigation, then the aca is workable without the mandate, litman said. there goes their severability argument.
yet in a 2016 law review article, kavanaugh cited the nixon case as one of the greatest moments in american judicial history, when judges stood up to the other branches, were not cowed, and enforced the law.
as part of various tributes to mccain, his coffin lay in state at the u.s. capitol, and his main funeral service was conducted at washington's national cathedral. it was unclear what trump was referring to in his comment about mccain's funeral.
another problem is how relatively little the women who are protected have to gain by initiating an investigation. workers generally can't expect anonymity when reporting their employers ― everyone knows who the new mom is ― which can be an invitation to retaliation. women have to weigh their desire to breastfeed against their relationship with their boss, hope for a promotion, or even their job itself.
the result would be some fairly dramatic shifts in who gets insurance, how much they pay for it, and, eventually, what kind of insurance they have. this isn't accidental. the decision to restructure financial assistance for insurance flows directly from the very different way republicans and democrats think about health care.
as they sat in their living room on a frigid january evening, they recounted reading through the medi-share literature and talking to friends who were already members. danielle, who has straight, light auburn hair that falls past her shoulders, was just starting her third trimester at that time, and seemed more perplexed than angry over what was happening.
unable to avoid such customers, insurers would have even more incentive to avoid providing expensive benefits ― to the point that they might start cutting out services pretty much everybody takes for granted.
that's what will likely happen with the trump tax cuts, said horace cooper, co-chairman of the project 21 national advisory board, an initiative within the national center for public policy research that promotes the views of conservative african-americans. the approach creates more economic growth because those at the top of the income ladder, not the bottom, are the ones who will take money from tax cuts to invest in businesses, creating jobs and increasing wages, he said.
the latest of those efforts is a trump-backed lawsuit, now before the supreme court, that calls on the justices to wipe away the law because of a supposed constitutional flaw. the impact of such a ruling would be especially devastating, barkan noted, at a time when so many people need medical care and are losing coverage because of joblessness.

washington ― after voting more than a dozen times to repeal the affordable care act and leading senate republican efforts to dismantle it, sen. john cornyn (r-texas) said monday that the good news is that people can sign up for president barack obama's signature health care law if they've lost their jobs and need health insurance amid the coronavirus pandemic.
the gop candidate in the #az08 special election, @debbielesko, either doesn't know or won't admit that her party's leaders want to cut medicare, medicaid, and social security.
knowing that a much greater proportion of our patients got coverage via medicaid or healthy michigan plan ― and a greater pool of potential patients in our target group now had access to coverage ― we were able to make decisions to add services, lisa rutledge, western wayne's director of special projects, told huffpost. we would not have almost 600 patients in mat [medication-assisted treatment] currently without that coverage.
it's a developmental necessity, newsom said of paid leave. we're committed to this.
trump's fiscal 2021 plan promises the government's deficit will crest above $1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels, but only by relying on optimistic economic projections, dramatically scaled-back military operations overseas, and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by trump.
the proposal has prompted charges from lesko that tipirneni is too liberal for the district. she's for this socialized, bernie sanders, medicare for all. and that's not what our constituents want, lesko said in a televised debate with tipirneni in late march.
to qualify for cobra, unemployed people have 60 days to opt in, and there is no break in coverage. cobra participants have 45 days to make their first payment covering the period from the end of employment to that date.
my understanding is it's going to be tax breaks for equity investments in infrastructure, sen. mark warner (d-va.) said of trump's plan. the problem is not equity. there's plenty of equity for anyone who wants to invest in infrastructure... but you've gotta have some of the revenue for some of these projects to pay back.
but i will not be deterred from ending the corporate greed that creates dysfunction in our health care system. we must pass medicare for all, he added.
a: the partnership for america's health care future, which represents a consortium of interests including insurers, hospitals, and drugmakers, has attacked the public option just as strongly as it has attacked medicare for all. it's possible industry groups might not ultimately fight the public option as relentlessly as they would medicare for all, but it's not like they're going to embrace the idea.

o'connor won't get the last word, because the supreme court is nearly certain to hear the case eventually. but it could be two or three years before the case makes it to the high court, depending on whether the democratic state officials defending the law ask for an immediate appeal and, if they do, whether the supreme court decides to take it.
maybe this is the thing that forces republicans to come up with a consensus idea of what to do, but we've been down this path numerous times without any success on an agreement. sen. jerry moran (r-kan.)
but that's not how congress rolls.
democrats will attempt to fire back by highlighting braun's business record, citing an associated press report that found his companies do brisk business importing goods from the same overseas countries he has criticized for taking american jobs and said federal records present a picture of a boss who has overworked and underpaid employees.
their anger at obama, at the others, was manufactured, in a sense, and it also was—and is—real.
a contentious theme has emerged on the campaign trail in which more centrist candidates argue a single-payer health care program would hurt union workers who've collectively bargained for strong health plans. sanders insisted his medicare for all bill would create coverage on par with union plans, while benefiting workers by taking health care off the bargaining table.
the ultimate trump failure on covid-19 was his apparent embrace of herd immunity, the concept of letting the virus run rampant while protecting the elderly and most vulnerable. most public health experts rejected the strategy, partly because actually segregating the elderly and the vulnerable turns out to be difficult if not impossible ― which means that, in reality, it's a strategy for more mass death among those groups.
oh, ok, then - sam levine: kansas secretary of state kris kobach (r), who was picked by president donald trump to lead a commission to investigate voter fraud, said not even he knows whether trump's claim that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally last year is true. the comment is notable because kobach has long pushed restrictive voting measures and has stoked fears of voter fraud, even though numerous investigations have found it's not a widespread problem. 'the commission isn't being put in place to prove or disprove that,' kobach said in an interview friday on msnbc. 'we may never know whether that's true or not.' trump has claimed repeatedly, with no evidence, that he would have won the popular vote in the presidential election if not for massive election fraud. he also suggested an investigation by conservative anti-fraud group true the vote would vindicate his claim, but the group recently scaled back its probe amid financial woes.

in light of all that, can you imagine why a berner might get a little steamed?
a survey her group commissioned with myers research delved into nevada, where republican sen. dean heller faces a battle for re-election in 2018. first, the poll found trump's approval ratings are under water, at 42 percent positive versus 50 percent negative. heller comes out even worse, at just 33 percent favorable and 53 percent unfavorable.
that system ― american turbo-capitalism ― has produced the biggest imbalance in income between rich and poor since 1928, the year before the great depression hit. starting in the mid- to late-1970s, according to a pew research center report, the uppermost tier's income share began rising dramatically, while that of the bottom 90 perccent started to fall.
the risks are even greater for those who won't have access to less-regulated insurance policies. people with illnesses or pre-existing conditions will face higher costs because they'll be shut out of the cheaper options.
medicare for all, as they call it, has become a rallying cry for progressives. supporters include rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, the newly elected democrat from new york, and three democratic senators ― kirsten gillibrand of new york, kamala harris of california and elizabeth warren of massachusetts ― who are running (or formally exploring runs) for the presidency in 2020.
employers could seek out private plans for the same reason ― although, as with individuals, interest would ultimately depend on whether private insurers, operating under closer government scrutiny, can actually offer a competitive product.
a small portion of that money includes contributions from the great america committee, a political action committee created by the vice president to advance president [donald] trump's agenda day in and day out.
that's nothing, given how much money uva makes, bai said. nonprofit hospitals advance their charitable mission primarily through providing indigent care.
the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, was passed in 2010 and included anti-discrimination provisions to prevent insurers from charging customers more or denying coverage based on age or sex.
and the policy has proved to be popular even in red states: voters have approved medicaid expansion in referendums in the solidly republican states of utah, idaho, nebraska and oklahoma.
but what about those employees who aren't on the company plan, which likely includes only people who work part-time and aren't offered those benefits? those who have health coverage at all might be using the exchanges (or they might have medicaid or be covered by a family member's insurance or something else).
washington ― in a speech to a liberal health policy conference on thursday, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) proposed new rules to force private insurers to be more responsive to americans' health care needs.
seven states, including alaska, minnesota, and wisconsin have done this and just this week the consulting firm avalere released a study showing that premiums fell by nearly 20 percent as a result. during the floor debate, dinah sykes, a democratic state senator, asked olson if gop leaders would consider passing reinsurance instead. she got no response.
associated press romney was happy to accept trump's endorsements during his presidential run in 2012 and in his race for the senate last year.
after spending a few days collecting his thoughts, gaffigan said he has no regrets.
and if it's unconstitutional, the lawsuit says, then the whole law is, too, because the mandate is supposedly an essential part of the law's machinery.
sanders also called for reforms to the filibuster by requiring senators to actually speak on the floor in order to filibuster a bill. currently, a senator can filibuster legislation or a nominee with a simple phone call.
now think about how often we do the opposite when it comes to issues like gun control. we demand an ideological fealty we can never hope to gain. the well is too poisoned and walls are too high. no partisan approach will accomplish anything at this point. so why are we still banging the drum of futility when we could be taking the lead on something that might actually help — like, say, onboarding 250,000 more mental health professionals?
he said he imposed an order to give 10 years in prison to rioters. that's a maximum discretionary sentence up to judges in existing laws. his order just asked the government to fully enforce it.
the amount of money that uninsured immigrants would need to cover health care costs was not specified in the proclamation.
the gop has accused baldwin of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the center for investigative reporting has noted there have been dozens of suspicious deaths.
how much can be done, and how quickly?
but whatever the motives, lueck said, the implications for non-members could be detrimental. i have every reason to expect that farm bureau plans would set out to enroll a significant number of people in kansas, and this is very likely to negatively affect the risk pool and people's premiums for individual-market plans.
white house press secretary jen psaki signaled tuesday that biden is also looking at limiting or reversing trump administration actions that allowed states to impose work requirements for able-bodied low-income adults as a condition of getting medicaid. such rules are seen as a way to cull the program rolls.
house democrats have already laid the groundwork for a federal lawsuit over the trump administration's proposed regulatory changes to the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which it borrowed from a house republican bill that congress didn't pass. the regulation would kick 755,000 people off benefits next year by reducing some of the leeway states have to waive the program's existing work requirements in areas with above-average unemployment rates.
there has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time, trump proclaimed in a white house news conference 27 days after taking office.
last week, in a series of tweets, trump alerted his republican colleagues to the snare into which they were about to step. republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...like the 116% hike in arizona. also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. don't let the schumer clowns out of this web...massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess, trump wrote. it will fall of its own weight - be careful!
many republicans have also promised that people with pre-existing conditions, such as berthie ruoff, will still be able to purchase insurance once the law is overturned. but the aca ended the past practice of discrimination based on medical history in part by enacting the individual mandate, which ensures that the insurance companies would get new customers to offset the cost of the sicker people it would have to cover. republicans are dead set on repealing the individual mandate, which they view as government overreach.
these negative findings give lie to trump's repeated promises that the republican alternative would provide universal coverage and lower prices for americans. shortly before taking office, for example, trump told the washington post that we're going to have insurance for everybody and that coverage would be much less expensive and much better.
polk county, which includes des moines, is bursting too. tamyra harrison, the county party's executive director, said that over the last decade, around 50-60 people have shown up for central committee meetings. on nov. 14, however, they had 177. the committee has 359 elected positions and at this time two years ago had 120 open seats. that number will soon be 80, now a record low, and is falling fast.
the supreme court has agreed to take that case, whose central argument has already prevailed before some republican-appointed judges in the lower courts, although the justices will not hear the dispute until their next term. and with the coronavirus threatening so many people, it's hard to know what the legal, political and policy environment around health care will even look like nine months or a year from now, when the justices are expected to decide the case.
cruz is seen goofing off in the video, initially asking the interviewer, aspirations? you mean like sweat on my butt?
q: is the president concerned that without having those essential benefits in there, you'll have a situation where women are just de facto paying higher for health insurance. obviously they'd be paying for maternity leave ― spicer: no, you could have a family plan. again, you're picking one benefit and trying to extrapolate it. it's also saying should young people pay for end-of-life care? the idea is to instill choice back into the market. it's not just about one particular benefit. it's allowing people to tailor a plan and cost point that's good for them and their family or them and their spouse.
obama could defend the core of his plan because he understood it and quite obviously believed in it. knowledge meant power and control.
in fact, it's hard to look at the requirements and not see them as part of a broader, more general assault on government-financed health insurance ― an assault that is still ongoing, all across the country, even though gop efforts to repeal obamacare were perhaps the single biggest reason republicans suffered such a devastating rebuke at the polls in the midterm elections.
sanders has every right to call out media operations when they get facts wrong. but sanders is supposed to be a professional, doing a professional job, and to ratify trump's inflammatory and absurd use of the term fake news to refer to legitimate news organizations is simply, yes, disgraceful. it's also the case that when cnn and other legitimate news organizations make mistakes, they tend to correct them promptly. meanwhile, trump has lied hundreds of times, and never admits or corrects a mistake ever. where his whopper cannot be sustained ― such as the suggestion that president obama wasn't born in the u.s. or that there are comey tapes ― he just makes like sherlock holmes and announces he has solved the case.
by that standard, trump's presidency has been disappointing. during trump's first two years in office, manufacturing jobs grew in line with overall job growth in an economy still climbing its way out of the great recession. that rate was not noticeably higher than in the economic recovery years preceding trump's presidency.
and so it is a very—pardon the pun—tough pill to swallow, michael continues. the public health community, we have to address helping people feel comfortable doing simple things like leaving their turning signal on too long, he says, alluding to black men's fear of aggressive policing.
to achieve this goal, he hopes to hire a staff of experienced policy experts and political hands to advise state governments. the people on the founders' council, he emphasized, will help open doors for the group but not conduct its research.
we have no idea what's being proposed, mccaskill said. there's a group of guys in a back room somewhere that are making these decisions. … we're not even gonna have a hearing on a bill that impacts one-sixth of our economy. we're not gonna have an opportunity to offer a single amendment.
fitzpatrick also agreed that the coronavirus was challenging some of the arguments for our current health care system. no doubt about it, fitzpatrick said.
massachusetts, delaware and missouri have high-profile democratic contests coming up, with several newcomers challenging longtime lawmakers in the wake of alexandria ocasio-cortez's striking victory against incumbent democratic rep. joe crowley in new york. republican primaries will test president donald trump's influence on gop voters in michigan and florida.
we were told at one point, everyone will get their time. and then he sneaks out six minutes early, a woman at the meeting told nbc 9.
here's hoping that the affordability agenda doesn't die when all of the election hype does.
the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxation expect the republican bill to reduce the federal budget deficit because the reductions to spending on health care programs for the low and middle classes would be larger than the tax cuts the bill offers to wealthy people and health care corporations.
but if the legal questions have been resolved, questions of public opinion remain less settled; and pollsters have asked secession questions on multiple occasions often with interesting and surprising results.
with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell promising a vote on a donald trump nominee to replace ginsburg, the court could be back at full strength by early november, with a new judge expanding the conservative majority to six. but that is only weeks away, which means it's also possible the court would hear the case with just eight justices.
even ferson, who also advises on the markey campaign, spends half his time arguing that massachusetts is moving more toward ideas like medicare for all, something markey has backed but lynch is against. ferson admits the district has changed, too, saying issues around climate change or black lives matter weren't big topics when lynch came to office.
at the same time, republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the types of insurance available. these efforts may result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health ― and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions.
callaway sells these, figuring they are better than nothing and are under insurance department regulation. but she says she goes through the plans with her clients very carefully, to make sure they understand all the ways a short-duration plan could leave them exposed to big medical bills.
of course, the prospects for getting a repeal bill through the house looked bleak until it didn't. after house leaders pulled the bill in march because it didn't have the votes, senior members began negotiating quietly on their own until they'd worked out a deal capable of ― just barely ― getting enough votes to pass.
texas had the most hospitals in danger of closing (75), the health metrics firm said. and mississippi had the largest share of hospitals at risk (79 percent).
the only safeguard against this would be new state regulations. but in the past, many states had thin regulations ― and if somehow republicans were able to both allow and encourage cross-state insurance purchases, even states trying to regulate their markets might be unable to do so.
this is a hard problem that's going to involve titanic solutions. but despite many of our best minds suggesting that some combination of basic income and universal healthcare are part of the right solution, we've largely deferred working on either. i suspect this is because the pain has been mostly felt by rural communities (which most legislators don't live in or understand). but this blight is soon coming to the cities, and we aren't ready.
if black americans have been marginalized because they were stranded on areas where there wasn't investment, this tax plan and the new pro-business mindset is more likely to see to it that the waters reach those islands and help people, cooper said.
as a result, some people who remain eligible for medicaid will almost surely end up losing coverage anyway. it's happened that way before, when states introduced work requirements for food stamps and straightforward cash assistance.
in two recent commencement speeches, one at rutgers and the other at howard, president obama deftly laid out the differences. he defined a progressive understanding of our collective path that has the virtue not only of being accurate, but also of being one that will help progressive candidates win election this fall and beyond.
one thing is certain, tax researchers say. the bill will need major repairs so that taxpayers can understand it, tax preparers can interpret it, and the legislation can have its intended effects. many of the needed fixes will require new legislation, of the sort house republicans unveiled in a 297-page bill on nov. 26. house democrats immediately signaled their unwillingness to cooperate without concessions, and the bill was unable to pass the senate where it needed 60 votes.
the better way agenda that house republicans put forth would end the expansion and either block-grant medicaid or dish out money on a per capita basis. that would almost certainly please conservatives, but it would also test the resolve of moderates who want to preserve the program.
the white house hasn't done much to draw attention to this year's budget release, though trump has revealed initiatives of interest to key 2020 battleground states, such as an increase to $250 million to restore florida's everglades and a move to finally abandon a multibillion-dollar, never-used nuclear waste dump that's political poison in nevada.
the trump administration also saw initially positive ratings for its handling of the coronavirus ― in march 2020 huffpost/yougov polling, americans' approval for the government response reached as high as 57%, while trump's approval rating on the issue reached the 50% mark. but as the pandemic continued on, those numbers slid underwater.
ok. but what do we know about the potential second-in-command? when
president donald trump's administration has taken its first action to change the way the health insurance marketplaces created by the affordable care act operate, aiming to shore them up for next year's sign-up period.
the white house has struggled to reach an agreement with democrats on a plan to fund the wall in exchange for relief for beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program. the program, which trump last year decided to end, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the u.s. as children to temporarily remain in the u.s.
meanwhile, insurers selling comprehensive policies will lose healthy customers, forcing them to raise premiums. people who don't receive tax credits will find these policies even more expensive. and if states decide simultaneously to reduce financial assistance for people buying these plans ― something that the new ruling might allow, though experts aren't sure ― then even those who qualify for tax credits could be in trouble.
and that was just one instance of trump trying to get rid of obamacare.
ellesia blaque, an assistant professor, pressed trump during an abc news town hall with voters in philadelphia. during a tense moment, blaque detailed her experience with a lifelong disease that costs her thousands of dollars annually in insurance copayments.

to qualify for help, uva patients must earn less than 200% of federal poverty guidelines ($34,000 for a couple) and own less than about $3,000 in assets, not counting a house, according to the hospital's website and guidelines uva files with the state.

still republicans did have at their fingertips other research on the cost of their bill. one report in particular was released dec. 18, 2017, by the tax foundation, a conservative think tank in washington. it published a rosier estimate that found the tax bill would add only $448 billion to the national debt over 10 years, less than half what the jct would report four days later. indeed, the tax foundation had issued numerous reports on republicans' proposed tax policies and bill ideas throughout 2017, many of which carried weight among republicans on the hill, washington tax experts and lobbyists said.
for that matter, what sense does this phony war on obamacare make when the gop offered no alternatives -- even to deal with pre-existing conditions or the ruinous effects of catastrophic illness? when did the gop stop caring -- i mean really caring, not offering bromides about liberating the engines of free enterprise -- about the everyday life of citizens who are falling behind?

the huffington post kenny anderson and ray pfeifer wait outside mitch mcconnell's office hoping to plead for his help passing a new 9/11 bill.
at the same time, warren, like her more populist counterparts, makes clear that she views the profit motive itself as the greatest obstacle to universal coverage.
but the trade-offs here are different than republicans typically let on. the price for allowing everybody to save a few dollars a month on premiums is forcing thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills onto those with illnesses that insurance doesn't cover.
nacy sexton, who is in his 30s and lives outside richmond, hoped he might get a break on his medical bills as a student enrolled at virginia. he was close to graduation in 2015 when he was hospitalized for lupus. after he was unable to cover the reduced bill offered by the hospital, the university blocked his enrollment, a notice he received from student financial services shows.
that's a dangerously ironclad promise. and if biden wants to know why, he should ask his old friend, barack obama, who famously promised that people who liked their old insurance plans could keep them ― when, in fact, some could not.
in 30 states, children in households with incomes up to three times the federal poverty level ― which is about $65,000 a year for a family of three ― can access either chip or medicaid. in 19 states, the upper limit is more than three times poverty, and two states allow only children in families with incomes up to double poverty to enroll.
but even though the mandate didn't work as well as the law's authors expected, it served a purpose by nudging healthier people into buying insurance. that meant more money coming into the system to cover the costs of the less healthy. there's now one less reason for people to get covered. combine that with the availability of those other types of plans that cater to the healthy, and it spells a sicker, more expensive mix of people on the exchanges. that will lead to higher costs for them.
when sen. elizabeth warren, a massachusetts democrat and presidential primary front-runner, revealed friday that she was willing to defer the most controversial element of her medicare for all plan ― the replacement of nearly all private insurance with a single government program ― until the third year of her presidency, she found herself in the unenviable position of taking fire from both her left and her right.
the judges focused on whether the 2010 affordable care act lost its justification after republican president donald trump in 2017 signed a law that eliminated a tax penalty used to enforce the aca's mandate that all americans buy health insurance.
the final budget agreement has more money going toward financial assistance, thanks in part to lobbying from groups like health access. that means the savings should be bigger too, although official estimates aren't available yet.
this gives us a pathway to start approving waivers, verma said on a call with reporters on wednesday. this is about helping those individuals rise out of poverty.
one beneficiary of this shift will be the insurance companies that sell short-term policies and make a lot of money off of them.
if the revised bill fails, gop senators have little idea what plan b is. i'll leave that up to the leadership to decide what to do, sen. richard burr (r-n.c.) said wednesday. you're going to have a health care system that implodes.

environmental issues are very important to me because i will still be around when the earth is at its worst and my children will be around as well, harrington said. issues, definitely pertaining to civil rights, discrimination, things like that are very important to me as well.
the thing is, there is no difference between obamacare and the affordable care act. the huffington post previously investigated the matter and discovered that they are the same damn thing.

after the washington post's devastating june 23 report on the obama administration's mishandling of russian meddling in the 2016 election, democrats may finally begin to see that their standard-bearer for eight years had some serious weaknesses in dealing with political opponents. obama routinely gave in when it wasn't necessary ― caving to the banks on foreclosure fraud, to fox news and breitbart on driving out shirley sherrod … and to republicans on nearly everything during his first term. at the end of 2012, then-senate majority leader harry reid (d-nev.) literally threw obama's fiscal cliff proposals on a fire, knowing that the president didn't have to make the concessions to mcconnell that he planned to offer. had the fiscal cliff deadline passed, reid and obama might have enacted their own bill with whatever they wanted. instead, obama dispatched vice president joe biden to hand republicans a package of conservative goodies so he could call the agreement bipartisan. and mcconnell racked up another victory off an opponent's own goal.
three highly touted democratic senate candidates ― iowa's theresa greenfield, texas' m.j. hegar and maine house speaker sara gideon ― all focus on mcconnell's influence in their campaign launch videos. hegar refers to her potential opponent, sen. john cornyn, as that tall guy lurking behind mitch mcconnell in basically every single video.
when trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015 and sounded islamophobic notes, mekelburg immediately jumped on the maga train. trump reciprocated by promoting her twitter account. by the time she'd arrived in fishkill in early 2016, mekelburg had a sizable social media following.
as part of our military build-up, the united states is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.
now the trump administration is undoing the obama regulations and putting new ones in place. under the trump rules, which the administration formally proposed in february, insurers will be able to sell plans that last for 364 days ― by design, one day short of a year ― with a possibility of renewing coverage twice.
high voter turnout in lexington played a big role in democratic gov. andy beshear's victory in the 2019 race against the extremely unpopular matt bevin, and mcgrath seems to be polling well in the district. of course, a presidential election cycle is going to come with a different turnout altogether, but hicks' race is worth watching.
the case is called texas vs. azar, and monday was the 5th circuit's deadline for parties opposing the republican states' lawsuit to file friend of the court briefs. mostly they were the kind of briefs you would expect ― from groups like the american cancer society and aarp, warning about the devastation to patients; and from organizations like the federation of american hospitals and blue cross blue shield association, predicting disruptions to the industry.

politics aren't a completely new world for the 19-year-old native of macon, georgia. he recalls growing up in a democratic household and his dad teaching him and his brother about elections as he watched america elect its first black president. he remembers lessons on the importance of voting — and lessons on how this country's political system isn't always fair.
a fox news poll published wednesday night finds that just 34 percent of registered voters support the gop's health care plan, with 54 percent in opposition ― 36 percent oppose because it makes too many changes to the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, and 11 percent because it makes too few.
ness also pointed to provisions of obamacare, like contraception coverage and requiring employers to give nursing mothers time to pump at work, as being huge milestones for parents, arguing that these policies are essential to women's ability to participate and succeed in the workforce.
biden has been using variations of this line at public events and during press interviews in recent weeks, and the subtext is pretty obvious: be afraid of medicare for all because you might die from it. it's an aspersion straight out of 2008 republican vice presidential nominee sarah palin's heinous death panels playbook.
behind that cacophony, however, was a real and urgent issue: the future of the affordable care act and what will happen to the millions of people who depend upon it.
tom brenner / reuters president donald trump delivers remarks beside hhs secretary alex azar and centers for disease control and prevention director dr. robert redfield during a tour of the cdc following a covid-19 coronavirus briefing in atlanta, georgia, march 6, 2020.
over the past year and a half, the administration has reduced the funding to promote healthcare.gov, the federally run online marketplace for coverage, all but certainly reducing enrollment. the trump administration has also given several states permission to change medicaid in ways that will make it difficult for some people to enroll or to stay on the program.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), whom quist backed in the 2016 presidential primary, is speaking at events for quist in missoula, butte and billings on saturday and in bozeman on sunday. quist's campaign had to move the missoula rally to the 7,500-capacity adams center arena because of the high level of interest in attending.
and they are right. but some healthy people would buy newly cheap policies and, when they got sick, would discover insurance doesn't cover what they need. some with pre-existing conditions could not get insurance at all.
asked about the trump administration's response to the coronavirus during wednesday night's debate, vice president mike pence reached for a historical comparison.
four years ago, huffpost reporter jason cherkis and i spent several weeks profiling mcconnell. we found a man with almost no ideological commitments. mcconnell believes in power — specifically his own. he is a tactician, not an intellectual leader. his lodestar isn't economist milton friedman or james buchanan. it's niccolo machiavelli.
republican attempts to repeal obamacare met a wall of opposition last year as the details of gop alternatives became clear and americans realized what it would mean for people who now benefit from the law's protections and financial assistance. as part of a broader mobilization against the trump administration and its policies, obamacare supporters showed up at town halls and protests around the country, leading to high-profile confrontations and pleas to keep the health care law in place.
on tuesday night, barkan talked about those struggles again: i have experienced the ways our health care system is fundamentally broken ― enormous costs, denied claims, dehumanizing treatment when we are most in need.
the senate's draft legislation could be changed before there's a vote on it. still, the chamber's gop leaders are pushing to bring it to the floor as early as next week.
but federal assistance tapers off at higher incomes and cuts out entirely at four times the poverty line, or $100,400 for a family of four. people getting little or no assistance can really struggle to pay for insurance. that's especially true for older consumers because insurers still have some leeway to charge them higher premiums. in the most extreme cases, insurance costs these people 20 percent of their income or more, not including out-of-pocket expenses.

but here's what hillary fans need to realize -- the enemy of your enemy may not be your friend if a) they are fighting a different, bigger, and more pernicious enemy than you are, and b) they think your leader, your enemy, and their enemy have too much in common.
this guy, i mean, he went to new york, and they threw him around like a rag doll, trump, who we've all been assured is set to tone it down a notch and move toward uniting the party, said of his top republican opponent.
he found himself in the headlines this week after a testy exchange with trump's postmaster general louis dejoy, asking him bluntly at a house hearing: what the heck are you doing?
and along the way, we have also disparaged native americans, the irish and jewish and italian and polish and german and japanese and chinese and puerto rican and mexican people, among many others. we have hated on arabs, muslims, the disabled, and we certainly have hated on lesbians, gays, bisexual, transgender and queer people. we have been equal opportunity with our hate, equal opportunity in our reckless disregard for full democracy, with each new era, each new generation, identifying someone new to hate.
is there no situation you could imagine with this fund where an experiment is tried that is profitable for the company but does not have the results that were promised? because sometimes when these things get started, it gets hard to walk it back. would you sort of pack your things up and quit if you thought it wasn't working that way?
the two men, while both republicans, were political foes. mccain was a leading member of the so-called never trumpers, conservatives who refused to get onboard the trump train.
although trump's opioid commission has put forth some positive proposals, they won't bear results unless the president funds them adequately, said dr. yngvild olsen, medical director of the institutes for behavior resources in baltimore.
at least, it had been running ahead ― until now.
according to the video above, however, some people are still not aware of this fact.
patti minter, a history professor at western kentucky university in bowling green, was one of those women. a longtime lgbtq activist, minter won a five-way democratic primary running as an unapologetic progressive and then knocked off her republican opponent by 7 percentage points last november. minter's race was always tilted in democrats' favor, given that it was in a district they've held for 40 years. but it was evidence of the energy that exists outside traditional party structures, too, especially in an area where any consultant would bristle at the idea of a candidate marching with drag queens three weeks before election day, as minter did.
the intricacies of learned league's rules and ranking system can get a little complicated (though you can read about them here if you'd like), but for our purposes, the most important thing to know is that learned league allows its members to view every question anyone on the site has ever gotten right or wrong. one of the more illuminating ways learned league breaks down information, though, is by question category, which means you can see both the percentage of questions mulvaneym answered correctly in each category as well as the corresponding site-wide averages.
on abc, biden denounced the white house's handling of the virus, declaring that trump's administration was at fault for closing a pandemic response office established by the obama administration in which he served.
we put together an event that was kind of an open mic type of event, less than two weeks after the election, lopez, executive director of the travis county democratic party, said. we had about 400 people in attendance, and that was right before thanksgiving. so even around the holidays, when ... people usually aren't paying attention, they definitely were.
but the cornerstone of trump's health policy agenda is a lawsuit pending at the supreme court that would wipe the entire affordable care act from the books, leaving nothing in its place, wreaking havoc on the health care system and creating 20 million newly uninsured people.
the new cbo estimates did not include the new potential changes that are currently being discussed in an effort to win over conservatives, such as eliminating portions of the affordable care act that require insurers to sell plans covering a set of basic benefits. this article has been updated with the evening caucus of house republicans with trump administration figures.
trump didn't make the same effort for another indianapolis factory. rexnord relocated its nearby ball-bearings plant to mexico, laying off 300 workers and offering a counterexample to the supposed power of trump's twitter account. the local 1999 represents workers at both rexnord and carrier, as well as several other factories.
but the draft is consistent with the principles ryan laid out in his a better way agenda over the summer, and the basic shape of legislation closely resembles a bill that health and human services secretary tom price introduced when he served in the house.
this is not to say that no attempts have been made in past years to introduce ways to evaluate effectiveness of health care services, whether involving comparative efficacy or costs. two national organizations were established in the 1970s--the office of technology assessment (ota) in 1975 and the national center for health care technology (nchct) in 1978--but both were later abolished after a strong backlash from powerful vested interests, especially the medical device industry and some medical professional organizations. (1,2) the fda remains our main regulatory body, but it is handcuffed by political forces preventing it from using cea in its coverage policies. it has been underfunded over the years, and is largely dependent on user fees from the industries it supposedly regulates for much of its annual budget, with obvious built-in conflicts of interest analogous to the fox in the henhouse.

gretchen whitmer, the state senator who would eventually win that contest, attacked her gop opponent for supporting repeal of the affordable care act. she also touted her role in getting the medicaid expansion through the state legislature.
they were asking the kinds of questions that you wouldn't ask if you weren't already persuaded by the plaintiff's arguments … that either all or a substantial part of the aca had to fall, nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor who helped write a brief for the case, told huffpost on tuesday evening.
warren is indeed at her most comfortable discussing the broad theme of a government that works great for those with money and connections and doesn't work much for anyone else.
even some lawyers who supported previous lawsuits against the affordable care act, such as ilya solmin from george mason university law school, think this latest lawsuit is weaker.
fortunately, that didn't happen because insurance companies and state regulators figured out a clever way to increase premiums only on subsidized products in most states. because the value of the government subsidies rises with the price of the insurance, those consumers were mostly shielded from the higher premiums. but people who didn't qualify for financial assistance had to bear the full brunt. plus, those higher subsidies cost the federal government a lot of money.
other employers seemed less humbled when an investigator came knocking. a worker at the furniture manufacturer polywood, in syracuse, indiana, reported that she was told to pump only during scheduled 15-minute breaks and her lunch, a routine that didn't give her enough time, and to do so in the women's bathroom.

they are part of the national association of insurance commissioners, which happened to be meeting in boston this weekend, days after the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) finalized new rules for short-term, limited-duration insurance policies.
ironically, cruz is also turning to the same man who helped turn the gop radioactive: trump, who announced he's heading to texas to stump for cruz next month. the same cruz whom trump called lyin' ted. the same trump whom cruz called a sniveling coward and serial philanderer.
four years ago in cleveland, real estate mogul donald j. trump took the stage and completed his takeover of the republican party by declaring: nobody knows the system better than me, which is why i alone can fix it.
and in his second inaugural address, obama again connected our founding values to the movements and activists who fought and bled to ensure that we lived up to them:
employers could continue to offer coverage and, because of the plan's structure, it's likely most would ― at least for the short- to medium-term future. but employers would have the option to buy coverage from the new medicare plan and, critically, individual employees could opt into the new plan even if their employers were offering coverage.
in the past two weeks, quist has made an issue out of gianforte's murky stance on the republican health care law, which the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated would deny at least 24 million americans health insurance. the law would have a significant impact in montana, where the state's uninsured rate dropped from 20 percent in 2012 to 7.4 percent in 2016 thanks to obamacare.
but she's tweeted full time since 2013.
if states wanted to maintain their current level of medicaid services, they'd have to make unacceptable cuts in other areas (such as education) or raise new revenues, and that's not likely. in reality, states would be forced to make deep and painful cuts. fewer people would likely be covered, and their benefits would be scaled back.
but even if o'connor's ruling did not take immediate effect, it could still have repercussions. the trump administration has repeatedly tried to undermine the workings of the law and might use a favorable ruling from o'connor as an excuse to do more.
maintaining the thin veneer of a functioning democracy
if there's no major harm from the decision and it's meaningless to invalidate the mandate, then plaintiffs don't have standing to bring the suit in the first place, leah litman, a constitutional law professor at the university of michigan, told huffpost. they'd only have standing if the mandate injures them.
the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 4, 2018
what the former fbi chief said is important. it's the most concrete evidence we have that president donald trump attempted to quash an investigation into his campaign's ties to russia. however, comey would not definitively say that trump is guilty of obstruction of justice nor would he say that trump personally colluded with kremlin officials. as huffpost's sam stein notes, comey's testimony alone will probably not spell the end of trump.
with the biden plan, 12.3 million americans with employer coverage ― including those who fall into the family glitch ― could save money with subsidized coverage, according to the kaiser family foundation projection.
but i do think there is truth to the fact that governors saw how well this worked in their states and understand that going backwards on that would be a horrible mistake. and i think that's exactly the kind of momentum that needs to be built.
after a day of canvassing, horne held out hope that parnell could do more than that, even as she chuckled that hope is a scary emotion in politics in the south.
this case, engineered by conservative and libertarian lawyers, heavily relied on a fictitious history of congress' intentions when lawmakers wrote the affordable care act in 2009 and 2010. seizing on a few words in the statute, these lawyers argued that congress wanted only residents of states that set up health insurance exchanges, not those in states that used the federal exchanges, to have access to subsidies. roberts wasn't having it.

over his first three years in office, trump has consistently taken credit for obama's accomplishments while blaming his predecessor for his own failures. for example, trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the economy under obama had been terrible and that trump had turned it around into a great success. in fact, steady growth began under obama following the 2008-09 economic crisis and continued largely uninterrupted until the pandemic.

then clinton delivered his kicker: dean had been furloughed during the shutdowns. clinton's call for congress to never again shut down the government received boisterous cheers from democrats. gingrich, meanwhile, sat awkwardly at the dais behind clinton.
and of the 10 major pieces of legislation trump promised to get passed in his first 100 days, only one – tax cuts – actually did pass, although it happened in his 11th month. the end the offshoring act, the clean up corruption in washington act, the affordable childcare and eldercare act ― not one of the other nine promised legislative accomplishments exists outside of trump's october 2016 press release.
i'm frustrated with how [administration officials] are presenting this, altman said in an interview. they're saying, 'here's this option that's affordable and wonderful,' and not talking about how limited the plans are.
although biden identified universal coverage as a priority should he become the president, the plan he put forward focused on insuring children, allowing near-seniors to buy into medicare and opening the federal employee health insurance plan to outsiders. it was similar to what john kerry, the former massachusetts senator, had proposed when he was the democratic nominee in 2004.
medical services for this population will cost the city about $100 million a year once his plan is fully implemented over the next two years, de blasio said.
tonight, we'll be doing the best we can to encourage as much social distancing as possible, meadows said.
however, dozens of people were at pains to point out that the aca was passed following votes by elected lawmakers in congress ― and not via obama bypassing the house and senate and declaring an emergency.
this story has been updated with information about high-risk pool enrollees joining the health insurance exchanges.
and here is how bertolini groused about justice department scrutiny to a former aetna official: the administration has a very short memory, absolutely no loyalty and a very thin skin, he said in an email.
without that money, many rural hospitals in texas and other non-expansion states have closed obstetrics units and other expensive services, forcing patients to travel long distances to seek treatment at the next-closest hospital, which is sometimes hours away.
trump said he would get tough with china and label the country a currency manipulator. after a year, he has done no such thing. trump said he would repeal obamacare and replace it with better health care at a fraction of the cost. he has done neither. and repeatedly, day in and day out, trump promised he would build a great wall along the nation's southern border and, more importantly, would force mexico to pay for it. while some wall samples are being built in california, trump has made no attempt to force mexico to pick up the bill. if a wall ends up getting built, it will be american taxpayers bearing the billions of dollars in costs.
tim franklin, who grows corn and wheat on a farm that's been in his family for four generations, testified during committee hearings that the plan he purchased for himself, his wife and his three kids this year will cost $24,000. if somebody got seriously ill, he said, they could owe as much as $7,000 in additional out-of-pocket expenses.
such advances are happening on an almost daily basis, and open up a whole world of opportunity for machines to successfully analyze vast amounts of data that would have previously been beyond them.
in other words, people who wanted or needed those benefits would be unable to find them.
the effort to pass the legislation lasted a year and would have collapsed if obama, pelosi and then-senate majority leader harry reid (d-nev.) had listened to all the political advisers counseling them to give up at every difficult moment.
of course, there has never been any indication that a republican alternative to obamacare would move in the voters' preferred direction. rather, any alternative plan would almost assuredly double-down on all the anxiety-inducing features of their current plans. as altman noted, this would probably not go over well with those voters:
the good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the affordable care act, cornyn said in a pbs austin interview. as you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. so that's an option for people.
ernst's comments were followed an hour later by montana gop sen. steve daines arguing it was unlikely the court would strike down the affordable care act because of a lawsuit he has long supported.
rep. betty mccollum (d-minn.) said people should learn a lesson from the republicans' defeat.
before 2016, this question would evoke a paranoid thriller. but in the washington post, max boot detailed the scope of russia's help for trump ― not only the strategic and devastating release of hacked emails, but a wave of targeted internet propaganda that reached 120 million americans. boot quotes the highly respected former fbi agent clinton watts: without the russian interference effort, i believe trump would not have even been within striking distance of clinton on election day.
under reconciliation, a piece of legislation must meet certain fiscal conditions to bypass the customary 60-vote threshold. a bill passed under those rules is forbidden from increasing the federal deficit outside a 10-year window, for example. democrats used reconciliation to pass much of obamacare, and republicans did so as well to pass their recent tax cuts into law.
klobuchar also asked for the nominee's thoughts on limits to campaign finance contributions by individuals, citing a past kavanaugh quote: i, for one, tend to think those limits have some constitutional problems.
that jibes with what franklin has seen among his friends, many of whom now belong to christian health sharing ministries that, like the proposed farm bureau plans, are cheap because they are not subject to affordable care act requirements. i think there's already a lot of people out of the marketplace, franklin said.
on friday, the u.s. reported over 45,000 new cases, shattering the record for the country's largest single day total. hospitalizations have increased dramatically in several states, including arizona, florida, texas and south carolina.
collins is not as much of a maverick as people give her credit for.
trump administration lawyers argued that an accelerated ruling requested by the u.s. house and a group of democratic-led states on obamacare is unnecessary and premature. there is no present, real-world emergency that would require a speedy decision, according to the brief by trump's solicitor general, noel francisco.
their stated confidence in the future of obamacare and its health care protections for millions of americans comes as democrats rail against supreme court nominee amy coney barrett, pointing to her criticism of a past ruling that upheld the health care law as evidence that she would move to strike it down. the supreme court is set to hear the new case just days after the presidential election.
on other occasions, parnell has struck a moderate tone in hopes of picking up just enough independent and republican voters.
washington ― the trump administration's effort to completely dismantle the affordable care act through the courts is having one immediate, unintended consequence: uniting democrats.
sure, they may (though may not) gain a few extra seats ― possibly even enough to retake congress. but america needs more than that right now. she needs that unity which comes from renewed commitment to a better narrative. this, of course, requires at least some participation from both sides. trouble is, the democratic party has shown themselves both unable and uninterested in reaching out to trump supporters.
california governor pushes high-case county to close ― 6/26/2020, 7:38 p.m. et
at first, i was taken aback by the president writing in a medical journal whose readership was pretty much limited to physicians. it seemed like he was using his bully pulpit to try and convince us that the affordable care act (aca) was well on the way to meeting its goal of increasing the number of people with health insurance, decreasing the costs of health care, and increasing the quality of the care provided. seeing as there are about 850 thousand practicing physicians in the united states (based on a 2010 analysis of the federation of state medical boards data base), i wondered why he was limiting his audience to such a select few. i then saw several related articles in newspapers and magazines commenting on the president writing an article in a medical journal. it is clear that the claims of the article did reach the general public which was probably the plan to begin with.
john hugged me tonight, conservative writer domenech said saturday night in a tweet that he later deleted, according to the newspaper. he asked me to take care of meghan. i said i would.
and as several trumpcare opponents have noted, it's not too late to fight back:

again this week, we have almost no idea what bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot.
· millions of jobs would be lost. according to a new report, the repeal of key provisions of the aca, including medicaid expansion, could lead to substantial job losses in every state – 2.6 million people could lose their jobs in 2019 alone, and nearly 3 million positions in health care and other sectors could be lost by the year 2021. massive medicaid cuts would only exacerbate this job crisis.
as our elected officials were fighting, smearing each other, making back room deals and fretting about their political futures, millions of patients were left hanging in the balance, worried about what the potential outcome could mean for them and their families. they were afraid, distressed and anxious about potentially being stripped of the coverage that they were finally able to secure after years of being denied – coverage that made sure they could access care regardless of a pre-existing condition – and coverage that removed the annual and lifetime caps that once loomed large over so many with serious and major illnesses. we know from much research that distress and anxiety like that experienced by millions over the past several weeks – even months - can have a negative and sometimes dramatic impact on one's health and health outcomes. yet it seems that the humanity and the suffering of so many were completely lost in this debate.
but although the restoration of the mandate might not be popular, and although its actual impact on policy isn't entirely clear, the combination of more assistance and a restored penalty will likely lead more healthy people to buy insurance ― which, in turn, should allow insurers to hold down premiums.
it feels like we're running as fast as we can to get to november, trying to wrest some control from a man who is steering the country ― and the world ― off a cliff.
what to do? in the short term, obamacare can be patched up by enlarging government subsidies for purchasing insurance, and ensuring that healthy americans buy insurance, as the law requires.

yo' memo is so unqualified, trump made it a cabinet member. #yomemojokes — alyssa milano (@alyssa_milano) february 3, 2018
true to form, it wasn't just republicans selectively embracing socialized medicine for this public health emergency. moderate democrats also liked the idea of the government paying for treatment and testing.
not every hospital closure is a problem. the worry is that some hospitals might cut back on services like psychiatry that typically lose money but are already insufficient to meet current demand. reducing hospital income crudely could make these sorts of problems worse, causing even longer waits for services ― or simply making it harder to deliver care effectively.
the major party conventions are over. the presidential campaign of 2016 is now firmly underway. and, the truth is that never have i been more worried about an election than the one we will hold on november 8th. the reasons for that are clear: never has there been an election when so much is at stake for our families, our communities and indeed, our nation.
those are just some of the reasons to think the real motivation for these changes has little to do with health outcomes, efficiency or the economy as a whole. a more plausible explanation is that republican officials ― including bevin and seema verma, the trump administration official in charge of medicaid ― think too many able-bodied adults are on the program. in fact, verma has said this explicitly before.
yes, the whole scheme is awfully complicated. but put it all together and what you have is a system in which, generally speaking, people who need more financial assistance get it.
as for people with preexisting conditions, here's what cbo predicted would happen, word for word: people who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non-group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all.
cnn's joan biskupic detailed the backroom negotiations between roberts and liberal members of the court in her new book, the chief, which will be released later this month. in an excerpt posted on cnn's website, biskupic notes how robert initially sided with the court's conservative wing and voted in a private conference to reject a key argument the obama administration had made in defense of the law's individual mandate. the provision, a core part of the health care law, required americans to purchase insurance or pay a penalty.
last year republicans decided to reduce the penalty to zero, effective in 2019, as part of the tax cut that trump eventually signed. that change is the impetus for the lawsuit. when the supreme court upheld the mandate in a 2012 lawsuit, it did so on the theory that the mandate was a tax ― logic that no longer applies, the plaintiffs say, if there's no financial penalty. and if the mandate is unconstitutional, the plaintiffs say, then the rest of the law is, too, because congress intended for the mandate and the rest of obamacare to work in tandem.
the association's report doesn't include calls for changes to federal policy, but fox emphasized insurers are concerned the obama administration isn't doing enough to prevent people from gaming the system by using so-called special enrollment periods -- intended for consumers in situations such as moving to a different state or getting married -- to sign up for coverage only after they become ill.
when andrew blackshear was a healthy 27-year-old, a freak incident led to a serious heart condition that required two surgeries to correct. blackshear, now 32, inhaled a coccidioides fungus that causes valley fever. i breathed in a fungus i didn't even know existed, he said.
until people who are outraged by the injustices done to them feel equally the injustices done to others, nothing will ever be permanently transformed in our america.
he again reiterated that he saw a difference between endorsing someone and voting for them, and he expressed his relief that clinton had lost.
asked for additional comment, sullivan's campaign referred huffpost to sullivan's statement approving of the trump administration's august decision. i support this conclusion — based on the best available science and a rigorous, fair process — that a federal permit cannot be issued, he said.
there's also the issue of pre-existing conditions and the tax credits, which are sticking points for thune himself.
tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities ― including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
unpaid hospital bills are a leading cause of personal debt and bankruptcy across the nation, with hospitals from memphis to baltimore criticized for their role in pushing families over the financial edge. but uva stands out for the scope of its collection efforts and how persistently it seeks payment, pursuing poor as well as middle-class patients for almost all they're worth.
and that money matters. multiple studies have shown that in states that expanded medicaid eligibility, people with addiction were more likely to get treatment and less likely to die. one study found that prescriptions of naloxone, a potentially lifesaving drug to treat overdoses, were substantially higher in expansion states than non-expansion states.
trump knows biden will beat him in pennsylvania, michigan and wisconsin, the states we need to take back the presidency, he continues.
and to be clear, the time for republicans to back away from trumpcare and its devastating consequences is now, not after tens of millions of people have lost their coverage, murray added, referring to the cbo estimates that trump's repeal push would cost 24 million people their insurance by 2026.
are you hopeful for the possibility of change?
in reality, they're becoming huge to get more bargaining leverage over everyone they do business with – hospitals, doctors, employers, the government, and consumers. that way they make even bigger profits.
by that evening, however, trump appeared to change his mind. he began tweeting that he would sign individual bills that already have bipartisan support, even if a larger agreement proves elusive.
nor is the conversation about health care reform ultimately one democrats can have on their own. every idea now popular among democrats has real potential to make medical care more accessible and more affordable. but every idea also comes with its own trade-offs.
goodwin believes that, under a sanders or warren presidency, the black community will be able to return to that self-reliance. the barbershop owner said that the way the country is currently headed, it's hard for our people to move out of poverty.
sanders shot back at biden on monday morning, noting on twitter that he fought to improve and pass obamacare and traveled all over the country to fight the repeal of obamacare.
they also say the ministries are siphoning off healthy individuals from the country's insurance pool, weakening the industry as a whole.
house republicans propose repealing the affordable care act's medicaid expansion by eliminating the additional federal funding for it. the federal government and states jointly finance medicaid, and states historically paid 25 percent to 50 percent of the costs, but the affordable care act provided at least 90 percent of the funding for the expansion population. this draft bill would reduce it to the share paid for other medicaid beneficiaries.
twenty-three million fewer americans would have had insurance under legislation that the house republicans narrowly passed, according to the congressional budget office.
in the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.

but when he unveiled the united states of care, a bipartisan health care initiative that would advance the cause of universal coverage by putting health care over politics, progressive activists pilloried him.
do you like politics? seek power and influence? have a spare million dollars?
the liberal judges seem likely to uphold the aca again, and most experts have thought roberts would be inclined to do the same, given that he passed up opportunities to invalidate the law when faced with stronger legal arguments. it's entirely possible some of the other republican justices would do the same in this case.
mccain faced criticism from democrats for not doing more to oppose the policies and appointments of a president he frequently lambasted, but klobuchar and other democratic senators frequently praise him as a republican they were able to work with during increasingly partisan times. klobuchar regularly mentions her friendship with mccain during her stump speech.
paul already has to worry about a recurrence of ovarian cancer. i mean, one is bad enough hanging over my head. to not have medical coverage for that is pretty unthinkable for me, she said. shevin is almost old enough for medicare, but paul has a few years left during which she needs health coverage.
and josh schwerin, who worked for democratic nominee hillary clinton's 2016 campaign, said the new accusation gives trump's supporters fresh material to work with. it immediately gives his allies in right-wing media something other than deaths and job losses to talk about all day, schwerin said. it's a relatively low-risk, high-reward move for trump, and so far it has worked pretty much every time he's ever tried it.
the member who recounted the discussions to huffpost in december was clear that chaffetz was not involved in any of the coup planning before the election. but chaffetz's move to re-endorse trump before november was seen by some members as political positioning. chaffetz, they believed, had correctly calculated he could never become speaker if he had openly opposed the republican nominee.
an honest politician could make a respectable argument for any of these positions. and on wednesday, the two front-runners onstage did a bit of this, like when biden noted (correctly) that his plan would be a lot less expensive for taxpayers or when harris stated (correctly) that a voluntary version of medicare for all, rather than one with mandatory enrollment, is what voters seem to crave right now.
things i like: napping, being in the front of the line, the smell of dryer sheets, sunscreen, breakfast, and very occasionally finishing family-size servings of junk food in one sitting (though i usually eat healthy).
according to politico, trump in ohio reiterated that i've never liked him much. his comments received a cool reception, politico reported.
i always knew he was going to be a fraud, lin said. four years later, that's been proven.
insurers would perceive weakening the individual mandate as a sign that the administration is trying to sabotage the law, he said. fear that healthier consumers would opt out without the threat of a fine would spook insurers into avoiding the exchanges, he said.
this comes after senator collins voted for more than 32 of trump's anti-choice judges, including two supreme court justices who now threaten the future of roe v. wade, he added. any pro-choice credibility senator collins once had is long gone.
hundreds of thousands and maybe more than a million people in california will have an easier time getting health insurance next year, thanks to a package of reforms that could be a model for other states and eventually the federal government as well.
a worker at a family dollar store in scranton, pennsylvania, asked for only one pumping break each day, but couldn't get it from her managers. she spent the majority of her time working alone and there was no coverage from co-workers to provide her an opportunity to take a break, the investigator wrote. when she did get a break, she had to pump in a stock room where both a vendor and a co-worker walked in on her. a family dollar spokesperson declined to comment on the case, citing privacy reasons.
yes, that mitt romney ― the godfather of obamacare, the man who carried out a health care reform program while he was governor of massachusetts in the 2000s and later repudiated his own success when he ran for president in 2012 because a guy named barack obama liked the idea and decided to extend it to the whole country. naturally, noted medicare-fraud-overseer rick scott, now a republican senator from florida, also stuck his nose in.
cbs news videos the math in the bernie sanders health plan can work, but only the federal government puts the squeeze on all providers -- and that includes hospitals.

and trump's justice department took the unusual step of declining to defend the affordable care act against a lawsuit brought by gop state officials in a texas federal court. the plaintiffs argue that eliminating the mandate penalty makes the entire law unconstitutional and that it should be stricken. the trump administration argues for a relatively less extreme outcome that would leave most of the statute in place but eliminate all its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
at issue is a challenge by the states of pennsylvania and new jersey to the administration's 2018 rule that permits broad religious and moral exemptions to the affordable care act's contraception mandate and expands accommodations already allowed under the 2010 law dubbed obamacare. the administration has asked the supreme court to reverse a nationwide injunction issued by a lower court blocking the rule from taking effect.
some plans envision government setting prices directly, not just for drug and device makers but for doctors and hospitals too. this is what most developed countries do, and it's the main reason health care in those countries is so much less expensive than it is in the u.s.

throughout the 20th century, attempts to create a government-run health care program were repeatedly thwarted by those who argued that individuals, rather than the federal government, should be in charge of their own medical decisions. yet instead of individuals, employers became the arbiters of most americans' health care through a system of employment-based health insurance.
the associated press declared mcgrath the winner on tuesday, a week after voters cast their ballots on june 23 in a primary election delayed and altered by the coronavirus pandemic. mcgrath led booker by roughly 7,000 votes ― 44.9% to 43.5% ― with more than 90% of ballots counted when the race was called. mike broihier, a retired marine and farmer who waged his own progressive campaign, finished a distant third, with about 5% of the vote.
coverage gains would probably be smaller. ten million fewer people would get coverage under biden's plan, according to projections. buttigieg's would probably reach more of the uninsured because he envisions some kind of automatic enrollment for people who don't sign up. but that could mean some people facing large retroactive premiums.
greg pence on tuesday won the republican primary for indiana's 6th congressional district ― a seat his younger brother, vice president mike pence, held for almost a decade, according to the associated press.
the other initiative newsom announced monday will affect prescription drugs and won't require legislative action because newsom was able to use executive authority. he issued an order that will allow one state agency to negotiate prices for all state programs that purchase drugs. that includes medi-cal, which by itself insures some 13 million people.
it was dead in the water until you revived it, said derek reichenbecher, 38, who has a heart condition. this is my life. without health care coverage, i'm dead. i'm dead.
biden, the last truly top-tier candidate to enter the contest, is unapologetic about his quest for bipartisanship, and is set to deliver a speech on bringing the country together on saturday in philadelphia. based on his past successes, he believes he can still persuade mcconnell and other republicans to agree to progressive priorities through a give-and-take negotiation.
desperate to keep power, trump and his party are backing bogus voter id laws aimed at restricting minority voting. if they can't kick legal immigrants out of the country, they will keep them from participating in american democracy. as ever, fox news spreads trump's propaganda. says tucker carlson, the latin american countries are changing election outcomes here by forcing demographic change...

and all this is against a running clock. if you show up in south dakota after 14 weeks gestation you are out of luck, she says, because that is the legal cutoff.
that is true even if republicans don't manage to fill her seat before the hearing. one possibility now in play is a four-four tie. if that happens, two legal experts told huffpost, then the affordable care act could become something like a zombie statute ― one that is unconstitutional but that continues to operate while litigation continues before lower court judges.
hsa expansions: the bill also expands the maximum contribution levels for hsas by nearly 100%, to at least $6,500 for individuals and $13,100 for families.
we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty ― and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
the loss of creditworthiness following the casino failures limited the scope of trump's subsequent businesses. instead of constructing and owning big, expensive buildings, trump largely had to settle for renting out his name on other people's buildings – a much less lucrative endeavor. in fact, one longtime friend said privately that trump's decision not to run for president in 2012 was based on a $15 million-a-year contract he had just been offered by nbc to renew his tv show. it was money he could not afford to turn down – a remarkable admission for a supposed multi-billionaire.
finally, three days after the president's rutgers speech, the administration announced new overtime rules that will make an estimated 12.5 million working americans eligible for overtime pay if they exceed 40 hours of work in a given week. going back to krugman, he called them a pretty big deal.

chairman grassley must not shield judge kavanaugh from evidence that kavanaugh perjured himself in previous confirmation hearings reads a joint statement by the three groups. democratic senators must put an end to this secretive sham. they know that nothing in the senate standing rules or judiciary committee rules grants grassley sole authority to designate documents 'committee confidential' or prohibit their public release.
ryan first gained national attention in 2010 at a televised, bipartisan meeting on the effort to pass then-president barack obama's health care reform bill. he'd been a representative for about a decade then. he distinguished himself among gop attendees at the session with obama for his knowledge of policy intricacy and ability to articulate a deeply conservative vision of government that would spend and do much less.

roberts wasn't alone. kennedy also latched onto the idea that it's so easy and so free to sign up for a contraceptive-only plan, and likened a religious employer's providing contraception to subsidizing conduct that they deemed immoral.
they all think the courts should reject the lawsuit. and they don't think it's a particularly close call.
newsom's announcement could help raise awareness. it can fuel the momentum we need to make this happen the way it needs to happen, said jenya cassidy, an activist who helped pass the state's first law. the director of the california work & family coalition, she said the group hopes to work with the governor's office to sharpen and improve the proposal.
committee rules don't say anything about whiteboards. they don't include any requirements for democrats to give republicans a chance to review visual materials ahead of time. there is a provision about the use of electronic visual aids, which encourages lawmakers to provide digital information to the committee a day in advance to ensure display capacity and quality.
it's difficult to find respectable legal experts who think the case is persuasive, and it's easy to find ones who think it is laugh-out-loud weak. but in the federal courts, the lawsuit has already won support from three republican-appointed judges, which is why it seems destined for the supreme court.
many, many more of his campaign promises, however, have not been kept.
the house passed the ahca repeal and replace bill in 2017, which would have allowed states to waive the aca's benefit requirements and let insurers charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions with a gap in coverage. — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) october 12, 2018
in what wyden called a bizarre twist, jorjani appeared thursday alongside mark lee greenblatt, trump's nominee to serve as interior inspector general. if confirmed, greenblatt, now the assistant inspector general for investigations at the department of commerce, would take over several of the interior watchdog's ongoing probes.
the gop bill also included new funding for high-risk pools, which would have offered coverage to people whom insurers wouldn't cover. this is something else that bishop and other republicans frequently cite as proof of their commitment to help people who can't get coverage because of their health status.
a procedural vote was expected at 10 a.m. friday, followed by a vote on passage of the bill in the afternoon.

there's no strategy. this white house could never be accused of having any strategy, laughed one of the republicans, an informal white house adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. he added that he doubted trump's fixation on the faux scandal would last long. there's going to be something else that pisses him off.
her reaching out across the aisle to work on bills is really important...because that shows she's hopefully able to bridge that divide, said todd macklem, a teacher in cameron who attended a gathering of local democrats and grassroots activists for baldwin in rice lake monday night.

the businessman's campaign was in many ways reminiscent of the agenda the trump administration has pursued.
i don't want to start over, he said friday. how many of you out there have had someone you've lost to cancer? or cancer yourself? no time, man. we cannot have a hiatus of six months, a year, two, three, to get something done. people desperately need help now.
trump and the republicans have all but admitted they are trying to sabotage the program. their efforts appear to be paying off.
i think that's disgraceful, trump said ahead of a joint press conference at the white house with far-right brazilian president jair bolsonaro. plus, there are other things. i was never a fan of john mccain and never will be.
democrats have a chance to retake the u.s. senate in november, but they'll need donelly to fend off a strong challenge from braun, a businessman and former member of the state legislature. but braun has one big problem: he happens to own an auto parts distribution company that imports products from china. that means control of the upper chamber in congress could come down to which of these guys gets blamed for exporting the most american jobs.
you know where the consensus in the [democratic] caucus is ― it's around improving the affordable care act, malinowski said.
for democrats, the hope is a significant portion of michiganders truly haven't tuned into the fast-approaching election day, and once they do, they will vote against trump's pick for the seat.
but there are barriers to getting new coverage, including wide variances in what's available from state to state, red tape and cost. those burdens will weigh even heavier on people who are also trying to sign up for unemployment insurance, housing aid and food benefits, as they adjust to a new reality.
we've been singularly focused on matt bevin for a year and a half, brewer said.
the other telling detail about trump's intentions is the one in the news now: the new lawsuit challenging the affordable care act's constitutionality. conservative state officials filed the lawsuit two years ago. its core arguments are so weak that even lawyers, activists and writers who supported previous legal challenges to the law have urged courts to reject it. but a federal district judge ruled in its favor and, by a 2-to-1 vote, a circuit court panel upheld the underlying argument.
that's a frightening reality. i'm not sure many of us have even contemplated losing.
and i think the one thing that this organization is wise to do is not say that there's a single answer. because the reality is i've assisted sanders' staff on their bill, i've read [h.r.] 676, i've read the [sen. tim] kaine's bills. i've read all the bills [pending in congress that would expand health care coverage]. and nobody would say we're yet at a point where we have a single answer.
the only possible leader right now is aarp, so it's sort of in their hands, he said.
snyder ran into resistance from conservative republicans in the state legislature, and it took years of negotiation ― and lobbying from consumer and corporate interests ― to win approval for the medicaid expansion. he never did win the marketplace fight. but the medicaid expansion has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to gain coverage. and snyder and his allies probably helped stabilize the marketplaces by having medicaid pick up some patients with expensive medical needs who would have otherwise driven up premiums if they were buying private coverage.
hopp said the sharing of the emotional and spiritual burden means more to members than the sharing of the financial burden.
kennedy will be the first massachusetts politician to deliver the response since 1985, when then-house speaker thomas (tip) o'neill joined bill clinton (who was arkansas governor at the time) and then-florida gov. bob graham. sen. ted kennedy (d-mass.) responded in 1982.
these officials have always had a lot to say about the aca's implementation, although they rarely get the attention they deserve. now they have even more influence, thanks to the ways that president donald trump and his allies have battered the law over the last 18 months.
newman, who had never run for any office before 2018, made the case that she was the real democrat in the race, painting lipinski as out of touch with his own party. abortion rights groups emily's list and naral backed her, as did chicago mayor lori lightfoot.

republicans would weaken or eliminate the affordable care act's new regulations on insurance ― like the requirement to cover all people regardless of pre-existing conditions, or the minimum standard for generosity of coverage. when these regulations took effect, insurers raised premiums; if the regulations become weaker or go away, it stands to reason, insurers will reduce premiums.
at the core of what is america is whiteness, or, rather, heterosexual white maleness. the straight white man, in the main, as the doer of all that is great and noble and good and heroic. this is what we were taught when we were children as we were given the stories of christopher columbus discovering america, of george washington never telling a lie, of abe lincoln freeing the slaves, of woodrow wilson being the great protector of american democracy during the years that marked world war i.
in fact, while sen. sanders proposes replacing private insurance with medicare, tipirneni would simply permit people to buy into the program.
she probably has to keep coming back to, 'you say blah blah blah about my overall medicare for all plan and how i would pay for it ― what i really want to talk about is what i am going to do when i am elected to help the american people get better health care.… my plan for doing that is better than anyone else's,' said teixeira, author of the optimistic leftist: why the 21st century will be better than you think.
the conventional gop was far less wedded to universal coverage than trump claimed to be. it sought to eliminate federal subsidies for moderate-income individuals to purchase coverage on the aca's insurance exchanges, defund the aca's successful expansion of medicaid and undo protections for people with preexisting conditions ― all without the vaunted replacement that trump had promised would be better than the original law. even the slightly less hard-line bill that came up for a vote in the republican senate in july 2017 was projected to result in 16 million fewer americans having health insurance. among other contradictions, the bill's medicaid cuts violate trump's campaign promise that he would protect social security, medicare and medicaid from cuts (he has also repeatedly introduced budgets proposing cuts to social security disability benefits).
it is not a tax increase if a person decides they don't want to buy an obamacare plan and as a result we don't send a payment to an insurance company, sen. pat toomey, r-pa., said during a finance committee markup of the tax bill in november. that's a tax increase? it's actually a tax cut.
washington ― a draft version of a house republican bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act shows how the move would weaken or eliminate coverage for an untold number of people on medicaid and private health insurance.

since the federal government would control what the new program pays the to providers of health care, it could set limits and reduce overall spending on health care. to pay for the new program, the government would have to raise existing taxes or create new ones.
on the other side of the capitol, rep. alan grayson has raked in 55 percent of his campaign's funds so far from small donors, a greater share than any other senate candidate. that's nearly five times the average for senate campaigns this cycle. nothing new, really, for the 58-year-old, harvard law-educated grayson, who is serving his third term in the house. he topped the list in percentage of contributions from $200-and-under donors in his 2014 race, as well.

the trump administration on friday told kentucky it can go ahead with its controversial medicaid overhaul ― an initiative that would reduce benefits, require some beneficiaries to work, and generally make it more difficult for people to stay on the program.
these two sites let you shop and compare prices for medical services in your area. if you are paying out of a health savings account, or have a high deductible policy, or are not covered for the service, it pays to shop -- whether you need a mammogram or an mri. those are list prices however, so you'll also want to ask your insurer how much your out-of-pocket cost will be, depending on the provider you choose.
about 30 million people are currently uninsured, and that number is likely to grow significantly as businesses shut down.
every conservative judge who has heard this case has said it has merit, bagley, a former supreme court clerk, said. i think they're all nutty, but that should give you pause before writing it off.
but republican officials in a dozen states still haven't expanded medicaid eligibility, even though the federal government picks up nearly all of the cost. an estimated 4.7 million adults who would be eligible remain uninsured.
warren isn't without bipartisan accomplishment during her brief time in the senate ― she often mentions her work with sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) on a law to cut the price of hearing aids ― but her signature legislative victory was the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau, which came despite ferocious republican opposition and happened before she even joined the senate.
asked to share what major sticking points are holding up the talks, sen. jeff flake (r-ariz.) laughed and said: where do i start?
to many residents of the lower 48 land-contiguous states, alaska is almost synonymous with the rise of the contemporary, rural-focused republican party. after all, the oil-rich state, which last voted for the democratic presidential nominee in 1964, gave the country sarah palin, the republican vice presidential nominee-turned-culture war avatar.
she and her staff also promote her buy america legislation that would require the federal government to use u.s. manufacturers for certain public projects. trump has said he backs this idea, lending some bipartisan bonafides to baldwin's bill ― but the senator is always quick to note her position has nothing to do with the president.
he said that he agreed with what [chief justice john] roberts said at his nomination hearing, at which he said that it was settled law, she told reporters after quizzing kavanaugh for two hours. she added that his answer on roe was very strong.
and the case might never get that far. comments from judges don't always signal what they are thinking or how they will vote. the lone democratic appointee on the panel is likely to reject the lawsuit, so it would take a vote in favor of the law by just one of the gop appointees to preserve it.
the overall consequence of the new rules is that health insurance will be harder to buy in 2018, especially for people whose circumstances change during the year, enabling them to buy policies outside the annual sign-up period. the length of that sign-up period is also cut in half.
gop lawmakers across the country have been facing raucous crowds at constituent town halls, with voters confronting them about their lack of a replacement plan for the affordable care act and asking whether they will stand up to the trump administration on controversial issues, rather than simply fall in line.
here's where things get even more unpredictable ― especially if it's an eight-justice court ruling on the case.
ryan frequently presented his plans as an attempt to restore fiscal order and gained a reputation as a serious fiscal hawk. in 2011, the committee for a responsible federal budget gave ryan one of its fiscy awards.
that's the opposite of protecting people with preexisting conditions.
what's more, the state was represented by a democrat in the senate as recently as 2014, when moderate one-termer mark begich lost reelection to sullivan. murkowski is known for defying party orthodoxy; after losing the gop nomination to a tea party conservative in 2010, she was re-elected anyway in an unprecedented write-in campaign.
they're not on the exchanges, she said. that's a falsehood.
democrats across the country have been closely watching the special election for georgia's 6th congressional district, where victory is within reach for 30-year-old filmmaker jon ossoff on tuesday.
the proposal is also winning praise from conservatives, especially sen. rand paul (r-ky.), who has been talking up the idea for years.
handler's troubles didn't end when she again opted for a more comprehensive gold plan for this year at a cost of almost $1,000 a month. handler discovered after choosing her policy that she couldn't see her oncologists in new york anymore without a referral from a connecticut doctor ― something she said was again the result of incorrect information from customer service.
texas, along with wisconsin, nebraska, kentucky and kansas sued on behalf three medical organizations, two of which are affiliated with christian groups.
trump said on saturday that he would pick a woman to fill ginsburg's seat, but the women on his supreme court list are extremely conservative. the threat to equality from the right is severe.
the lammers were dumbfounded. during the conversation when danielle had mentioned the bump, it was not causing her discomfort, and the doctor had said not to worry about it. i wasn't medicating it, i wasn't treating it, danielle said in january, when she first told her story to huffpost. it's not like every bump becomes cancer.
millions of americans raised their voices to call on congress to defeat #trumpcare and today the american people have victory. — rosa delauro (@rosadelauro) march 24, 2017
he's [@mariodb] really just bad news on all of the issues that are important to the people in this community @mbfforcongress slammed rep. diaz-balart (r-#fl25) for working against the best interests of his constituents on the @msignorile show pic.twitter.com/us97qegg7k — siriusxm progress (@sxmprogress) october 11, 2018
sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.) introduced legislation earlier this year aiming to do just that. republicans are pointing to the bill as evidence of their good faith commitment to those with preexisting conditions. but while it does prohibit insurers from denying applicants based on pre-existing conditions, experts say tillis' bill leaves out several other protections found in the aca, such as its ban on annual or lifetime limits on benefits, or its provision prohibiting insurers from charging women more than men.
the freshmen in congress are often portrayed as leftists or socialists, and some of them are. but the biggest difference between the new kids on the block and the old liberal guard is that the freshmen actually want to exercise power, while their leaders have learned to thrive in a political environment in which they have to make do with modest concessions, tinkering around the edges of a fundamentally conservative agenda.
they said no compromise because they have this fixation on planned parenthood, reid told reporters.
that year, three democrats from solidly red states — manchin, ohio sen. sherrod brown, and montana sen. jon tester — will be up for reelection in a presidential year, though all have defied the odds before.
roger leakes is a self-proclaimed country boy. he grew up in upstate south carolina near the newberry county line as the oldest of 10 siblings. he and his family were sharecroppers. in adulthood he became a teacher, but he decided to enlist in the army to make more money.
on monday, the justice department told a federal appeals court that the federal government agrees with gop state officials and a lower-court ruling that the entire law should be thrown out on constitutional grounds. if that ruling stands against an effort by democratic state attorneys general to protect the law, millions of people would lose coverage and millions more with pre-existing conditions could find themselves unable to obtain health insurance.
with nine republicans going on record against the bcra, mcconnell would have his work cut out for him in passing a similar piece of legislation, as senators are now on the record against the bill. (technically, senators were rejecting a procedural motion for the legislation, but this vote largely served as a proxy for a vote on the bill.)
it's not clear whether the public option biden envisions would actually offer that better deal, because he hasn't provided enough details on how it would work. but, at the very least, it could be the foundation for a bigger plan in the future, one that really did use government pricing power to get better deals from doctors and hospitals. it could then pass along lower premiums to enrollees.
when meadows was asked about trump's book, the art of the deal, and how walking away from a negotiation was textbook trump, meadows said that in order to get the best deal, you always have to be ready to walk away from any negotiation.
all would spend more government money subsidizing insurance to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs. all would expand existing public programs or create new ones, on the theory that such programs are more efficient and humane than private alternatives. all would have the government use its power to lower prices, on the theory that regulation can accomplish what competition has not.
leah litman, another constitutional law professor at the university of michigan, said she saw things similarly.
maag said it is not unheard of for congress to examine how their policies could affect different people at various income levels, but she doesn't expect congress to consider that in any future tax cut bills this fall. after all, she said, congress had data showing how the new tax law provided only modest, at best, benefits for low- to middle-income families, and that did not persuade them to rethink how these families would be treated.
a prominent liberal think tank just put out an ambitious new health care proposal.
over and over again, kavanaugh argued that addressing issues that may arise before the court would be improper for an independently minded judge. the conservative jurist, who was nominated by president donald trump, noted that his approach is consistent with how other nominees have discussed issues they may rule on. he also declined to touch some of the most pressing topics of the day.
the primary target of the attack was rival presidential candidate bernie sanders, the independent senator from vermont and longtime champion of medicare for all. sanders quickly responded, first through aides and then in a speech that basically accused biden of lying, although he never mentioned the former vice president by name.
lujan said the budget was an opportunity to contrast who trump is with who democrats are. think about the success that we had as democrats in 2018, earning back the trust of voters where it had been lost, he said, specifically mentioning the kitchen table issues like health care.
you voted for trump? came a message.
most days, it seems like just about everyone is working in investment banking or sales and trading. athletes, writers, performers, and free thinkers alike cast aside their passions to pick up the noble - and unfortunately rare - torch of job security. starting as early as four in the morning, summer analysts flooded midtown and wall street, hurrying along in professional get-up ill-suited for the city heat. they bore slightly pinched looks, which can be attributed either to the need for breakfast or the refusal to commute in sneakers. for these types of interns, the days stretched ahead in lengths of ten, twelve, fifteen hours - not including lunch. they were at the complete mercy of the markets and the bosses, and although they were paid more than most, clever loopholes like prorated salaries and unpaid overtime allowed banks to exploit the widespread desperation for a job upon graduation as economically as the jeans-sporting, don't call me your boss boss at the non-profit, sustainable travel app. even worse, many of these competitive firms promoted an office culture that made their interns feel invisible and disposable, not respected; they sowed fear and deference, rather than curiosity and energy. in short, it appears to most rising seniors that they face a career ultimatum: choose the soul-crushing misery of the initial years in finance, or else suffer the terrifying uncertainty - rather like the waiting place dr. seuss warns of in oh the places you'll go - of literally anything else.
but perhaps nowhere is the impact more vivid than in the fight against the opioid epidemic, which has taken nearly half a million american lives over the past two decades. today, medicaid underwrites care for more than one-fifth of all americans receiving treatment for substance abuse, more than any other single program.
some of the freshest proof comes from arkansas, where work requirements are furthest along and more than 18,000 people have lost medicaid as a result. trump administration officials, who gave arkansas permission to impose the requirements, said they believe most of the people who lost medicaid found jobs. an analysis of state data from the progressive center on budget and policy priorities indicates that they probably didn't find jobs ― and that even those who did probably didn't get health insurance.
uva would not disclose basic information about patient lawsuits, liens and garnishments. reporters reconstructed the hospital's practices by talking directly with patients, analyzing court documents and hospital bills and observing the legal process in court. they gathered records in charlottesville, where the uva health system is located, to supplement a courts database compiled by the nonprofit code for hampton roads, which works to improve government technology.
but when feinstein asked whether he believed a woman had a right to choose an abortion, kavanaugh said only that roe is an important precedent of the supreme court.
gianforte is hoping to fill a seat that ryan zinke vacated when trump picked him to become interior secretary.
ginsburg did this not just by representing women who were facing discrimination but by representing men. one of her notable cases involved stephen wiesenfeld, who wanted time to stay home with his baby boy, jason, after his wife, paula, died in childbirth. at the time, social security wouldn't pay out full benefits to widowers because they weren't supposed to need them like widows did.
i'm so sorry — i know there are limits on coverage and i don't think i can afford this many tests and appointments, i said, embarrassed.
the trump administration has now made clear that it wants to completely eviscerate the aca, jayapal continued. so i think it's very important for us to meet the immediate needs of the health care that's been stripped away, she said.
the $164,000 billed to heather waldron for intestinal surgery was more than twice what a commercial insurer would have paid for her care, according to benefits firm wellrithms, which analyzed bills for kaiser health news using cost reports uva files with the government. charges on her bill included $2,000 for a $20 feeding tube.
aarp's concern about how the republican bill would affect americans 50 and older is well-founded, according to two health care experts.
be an inhabitant of the state you represent
after roe passes and the pro-choice movement relaxes, then and only then does the anti-abortion movement get going in a big way, says joffe. it was not until the late 1980s that you started to see the clinic blockades, the state laws chipping away. and while all that happened, the pro-choice groups kept losing ground.
like many other republicans huffpost talked to, budd seemed to take more issue with the gop's inability to repeal obamacare than he did with the bill republicans offered up as a replacement.
donna thompson hasn't decided who she's voting for yet, but it won't be trump.
there were other things that were happening as well at the same time, and we did not have a democratic congress to be able to get it done, biden said.
to be sure, the republican senator largely votes with her party. she's voted to confirm all of trump's lifetime federal judges beyond kavanaugh, even though she's pro-choice and many of trump's court picks strongly oppose abortion rights. she voted for the gop tax bill that gives the richest 1 percent of americans 82 percent of its benefits over time.
the requirement could apply to hundreds of thousands of people who move to the u.s. each year on immigrant visas, which allow people to eventually become permanent residents. last year, the u.s. issued about 534,000 visas, a 4.6% decline from the previous year's total, according to the journal.
on the heels of the justice department's announcement monday that it is fully backing a lawsuit that would eradicate the entire affordable care act ― a decision trump reportedly directed himself ― the president has begun making big promises that he and the republican party are on the verge of revealing a tremendous new plan that will make american health care great for everybody.
for as long as there has been an affordable care act, there has been a desire, among republicans, to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with an alternative plan. as far as having something on which to campaign, this has served republicans in good stead. ranting about the need to repeal obamacare has never gone out of style with the gop base.
a key takeaway that they didn't discuss? the position each was advocating has already been proposed, attempted, and failed. in congressman sanders' own state of vermont, a single-payer system performed so poorly and cost so much that less than a year after it was enacted, vermont pulled the plug. based on the state's one year of experience, state income taxes would have to be raised 10% across the board for all taxpayers, in order to cover the costs of the single-payer plan. a 10 percent increase in taxes didn't seem to make sense, especially since that would only cover needs for subsequent years if there were no cost increases. cruz's plan, establishing high-risk pools, has also been tried. since the aids crisis, high-risk pools have been available to allow people with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage. the problem is that individuals still have to pay for their insurance and those who are seriously ill can't afford the premiums, even though they are subsidized.
although the odds of tipirneni flipping the seat are not in her favor, her candidacy has excited the democratic base, enabling the party to improve its chances in other races. in november, arizona democrats hope to take control of the state senate and plan to mount serious bids for the governorship and an open u.s. senate seat.
o'rourke, who is polling in single digits, has adopted a more urgent tone in his campaign since the mass shootings in el paso and odessa, texas, last month and has put an aggressive gun control push at the center of his messaging. it's paying off: the o'rourke campaign bragged that it had its best fundraising hour of the quarter during the debate. it's possible this is o'rourke finding his stride. but it's also possible it leads to a burst of attention with little long-term effect. (see the praise of former housing and urban development secretary julián castro after the first debate for an example.)
originally from st. louis, albergottie has lived in columbia for the past 40 years.
and it could be replicated in 2020. with president donald trump's white house in constant flux, his rhetoric's divisiveness increasing without apparent end and more americans describing themselves as exhausted by politics, democratic strategists have begun musing that the best way to defeat trump may be to go boring.
economists such as rutger's soled say there's no conclusive evidence that trickle-down economics creates jobs and increases wages for lower income workers.
according to ted cruz, what we should care about is access to health care, not insurance per se. this means that all people should have access to health care, but they still should pay for it themselves. with insurance costing at least $10,000 annually for a family, along with deductibles in excess of $5,000, how is the average family going to afford their care? cruz thinks that allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines and reducing regulations will do the trick. the insurance companies, because they would be making more money, would, out of the goodness of their hearts, pass this increase onto consumers by reducing their prices. this would result in reduced costs for the family. since insurance company margins have never been greater, this scenario is a bit far-fetched.
sinema is running the campaign i wish i could run over and over again in that state, said andy barr, a democratic strategist who has worked extensively in arizona. she's been allowed to introduce herself to voters on her terms with almost no pushback for months.
right now, the aca is under attack, house rules committee chairman jim mcgovern (d-mass.) told huffpost on wednesday. the president has launched an all-out war against the aca, and if he succeeds in the courts, then 22 million people lose health insurance right off the bat. so we're confronting an immediate threat, and i think it's absolutely appropriate to do that.
the analysis found that the middle class really did come out ahead, although that determination came with a few, very important caveats that frequently get lost in these debates.
trump became a real republican at the very worst time ― a time when republican orthodoxy could not be less wanted by the american people. saagar enjeti, co-author, the populist's guide to 2020
ipab, the cadillac tax and provisions like them by no means represent the only ways to reduce medical spending. they also raise serious questions, like whether ipab violates the constitution ― or, at least, the spirit of the constitution ― by having its cuts take effect automatically unless congress objects.
leakes and others like him may not agree with addressing the student loan debt crisis with tax dollars, but that isn't stopping candidates from including it in their platforms. last year, warren announced that she would take steps to broadly cancel student loan debt on her first day in office if elected. sanders' plan is to cancel all $1.6 trillion of the country's student loan debt.
in the past three or four days, one of the really good things that's happened is that a bunch of the people in states who are working on really exciting initiatives have sent us a bunch of information about it. i haven't had a chance to evaluate it all. the team is still evaluating it.
those numbers aren't simply a byproduct of poor outreach. an unusually large number of iowans are holding on to grandfathered or transitional plans ― policies that existed before the affordable care act took effect and that remain cheap, mainly because they originally enrolled people who were in relatively good health. as of last year, these holdover policies accounted for more than half the total market, according to estimates by charles gaba, the michigan-based policy analyst and proprietor of the website acasignups.net.
ok, well, what are the precursors to making that happen? i think there's a couple. and everyone is free to agree or disagree with these, but one of them for us is indeed tapping into that body politic. a second is building models in states that can be replicated at the federal level much in the same way that [the massachusetts health care law under then-gov. mitt romney] was in the aca.
law professors file amicus briefs in major constitutional law cases all the time. what makes this particular group and their brief unusual is that they represent very different points of view and clashed repeatedly when previous challenges to the affordable care act were moving through the federal courts.
jonathan cohn/huffpost courtney callaway, an omaha-based insurance agent, says she doesn't sell membership in sharing ministries because they are not subject to affordable care act regulations and outside the jurisdiction of state regulators.
that likely pushes a hearing and ruling back until after the 2020 election, which is presumably why republicans were hoping for the delay. keeping the lawsuit in the news would probably hurt the republicans politically, given strong public opposition to gop repeal efforts.
i think it's almost like the senate race a little bit — i don't think there isn't a whole lot of oxygen between how the two of them would vote on most issues. scott ferson, rep. stephen lynch's campaign spokesperson
the other republican appointee, kurt engelhardt, seemed less inclined to spin out fantasy scenarios. instead, he questioned whether the 2017 tax cut vote really mattered because it took place during the budget reconciliation process, in which special parliamentary rules limited the scope of what congress could do through legislation.
it's the social and cultural issues that moved this state rightward, said voss, the university of kentucky political scientist. when it was, 'it's the economy, stupid,' people here were voting for the clintons.
the primary mechanism for doing this involves a reinterpretation of a separate federal law, called the employee retirement income security act, which governs the insurance plans of large employers and is under the jurisdiction of the labor department. that's why it's labor and not, say, the department of health and human services, proposing the new regulation.
alex wong via getty images rep. jan schakowsky is a longtime advocate for expanding government-run insurance programs.
democrats are developing a clear advantage in the political fight over president donald trump's nomination of amy coney barrett to the supreme court, with public polling showing opposition to the senate rushing her confirmation, the focus of the fight shifting to friendlier political terrain and republicans openly wishing for democratic missteps.
the fed is an important institution, responsible for managing the american economy to ensure maximum employment and reasonable price stability. as the most powerful bank regulator in the country, it's also responsible for preventing a financial crisis. there are a lot of problems with the way the fed currently operates, but none of them will be solved by adding a clown to the board of governors.
in other states, regulators simply allow the ministries to operate. in montana, gop exemption bills kept running into vetoes from democratic governors until a conservative republican, matt rosendale, won election as insurance commissioner in 2016 and promptly reversed the old ban.
the answer will likely depend on the democratic member questioning the former fbi chief, but the two committees interviewing mueller have a limited amount of time — and republicans seem intent on trying to undermine every word mueller utters, potentially also drawing out some sound bites where he casts doubt on the russian collusion narrative. each lawmaker has to decide how to use his or her limited time questioning mueller.
and for every leonard lance, there are 10 house republicans who are dedicated to repeal no matter what. as rep. john shimkus (r-ill.) said wednesday, if it's a repeal, i'm there.
that's what scares me the most is going back into that realm, blackshear said. to have a company that will battle someone while they're going through a life-or-death illness and still need care.
warren has said that in her third year in office, she would ask congress to pass legislation moving all the way over to the version of medicare for all in the sanders bill.
he boasted about the covid testing system and about his general response. look, experts universally say the u.s. was fatally slow and its response especially slow in setting up adequate testing.
plus there are bound to be americans, maybe quite a few of them, who simply assume that any change is bound to be a change for the worse. and as the obamacare experience showed vividly, people unhappy about health care reforms can be a lot more vocal than those who are happy about them.
we virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.
and then mulvaney said the time for deals was over.
that's just the nature of our political tapestry, he said.
he talks about climate change all the time, leakes said. and he says that he doesn't like the usage of fossil fuel. well, i'm going to tell you that is the backbone of our lives here in the usa, fossil fuel. and if we do anything to disrupt that, we're going to be in for a big problem.
the overall aim is to reduce the influence moneyed interests can wield over policymakers. the numerous policy proposals she's released during the campaign have similar elements: just this week, warren released a plan to limit the defense industry's influence on the pentagon.
it's another act of obamacare sabotage
republicans would create chaos in the health care system because they're stuck between a rock and a hard place, schumer said. they have no idea what to put in place of the affordable care act.
the story has been updated with comment from nancy pelosi.
clinton also effectively used his bully pulpit to shame republicans, highlighting the personal toll of the shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. during his 1996 state of the union address, he honored the service of richard dean, a heroic public servant who risked his life to save others during the oklahoma city bombing the previous april. he was sat in the first lady's box for the address, and when clinton honored dean's service, the entire chamber applauded him. from clinton's speech:
sen. ben cardin (d-md.) also said that he would like to see it as large as possible.
the senate voted 52-47 to make readler, 46, a lifetime federal judge. every member of the chamber's democratic caucus opposed him with the exception of sen. joe manchin of west virginia, who did not vote. every republican but one, sen. susan collins of maine, voted for him.
we have to begin with what we have to do to get the outcome we want. and i think there should be participation and debate that we haven't been able to have over the last seven, eight years because we've been playing defense against keeping the law standing up. it's time to move past that and try to create a positive vision.
one position that puts him firmly in the progressive wing of the party is his support for the safe importation of prescription drugs from outside the united states.
the 2020 democrats have some big disagreements, but if you step back, you'll see they all support new government-run insurance programs, more government influence over prices and more financial assistance to protect people from crippling medical bills. the common thread is that they all want to move the country in the same direction, toward making health care truly a right.
there's been a collective attack on the right to organize, said bullock. he advocated for card check legislation that would make it harder for employers to dissuade workers from unionizing. we need to do things to make it easier to bargain collectively, not make it harder.
i hope decisions aren't made in a vacuum and that there is a reach out to the governors. everything can be improved, he added of the law. the rhetoric i've heard is nobody's going to lose their coverage, that prices aren't going to increase. i say great, that's wonderful. but until we get into the specifics, i'm not going to get into an adversarial relationship.
democrats laughed off collins' maneuvering on the floor, accusing her of voting to include witnesses in the trial only after receiving approval from republican leadership.
today, people buying coverage through one of the marketplaces are generally eligible for subsidies. but the subsidies are smaller than the ones buttigieg now proposes, they are designed to pay for the less generous silver plans, and they are not available to people whose income is higher than four times the poverty line, which is about $50,000 annually for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four.
but the number of uninsured americans, currently at a historic low thanks to the 2010 law, would almost certainly rise if something like this proposal became law. combined with changes to insurance benefits, the net result of the bill's changes would likely be dramatically greater exposure to punishing medical bills and reduced access to care ― particularly for people who have serious health problems or who aren't entirely able to pay for comprehensive coverage on their own.
the problem with the multiple efforts to repeal the aca and 'replace' its pre-existing condition protections with alternatives ― such as the [final house] amendment and the bills that have been introduced more recently ― is that they all include massive loopholes that will make coverage effectively inaccessible for people with health care needs.
you mean the obamacare that passed through congress while your dad is calling a national emergency for 50 miles of wall?
again, i couldn't end the conversation because he hadn't said the magic words, i hate hillary. in my book, that's usually not-so-secret code for, i hate women. then he told me he wasn't sure he'd have voted for trump if he'd actually thought he had a chance of winning. that gave me pause.
the promise of simplicity is one reason price regulations are getting another look. if hospitals could send bills just to one place, instead of dozens, and if they could have just one list of prices, they wouldn't have to maintain such complex electronic billing systems and hire so many people to run them.
an avid sanders supporter, the 50-year-old businessman was born and raised in columbia. he explained that he will likely be supporting the vermont senator for a second time, primarily because of sanders' enduring case for democratic socialism.
very soon after, when i had lunch with an old boyfriend and he said he was on and liked tinder, i was like, huh??? you are on tinder??? tinder is a hook-up site! (he does not strike me as the hook-up type of guy, which was part of why i was drawn to him.)
fighting for women ― and men
it's a popular agenda among bevin's biggest backers ― the koch-funded american legislative exchange council counts him among its best of the best lawmakers ― but it may test just how far kentuckians have moved on economic concerns.
just the idea of a private option might ease anxieties over making enrollment in a new government plan mandatory. polls have shown repeatedly that medicare for all's support drops if voters think it means displacing private insurance altogether. but keeping private insurance also means keeping private insurance bureaucracies, which can mean more complexity and waste, as well as more denials of treatment for seemingly arbitrary reasons.
however, swinton said she wishes the candidate lineup reflected the diversity of the democratic party's biggest supporters.
there is also little reason to think these changes would make kentucky's medicaid program more efficient. on the contrary, new requirements such as checking to make sure people have jobs will inevitably require more administrative work ― not just for the people who want medicaid, but for the state government as well.
his record is going to be easy to flush out, braun said in his victory speech on tuesday night, citing donnelly's votes against the tax bill and for maintaining obamacare. i intend to be the person to send joe donnelly to an early retirement.
the lack of a crowd, or even a real convention, in milwaukee deprived democrats of images of cheering fans and delegates. but it also freed them from a fear of boos. the virtual convention team repeatedly highlighted gop supporters of biden's, something that likely would have drawn boos from liberal attendees and highlighted divides within the party.
on the day that a recording came out of trump bragging he grabs women by their genitals and forcibly kisses them without their consent, chaffetz was the first congressional republican to say, i'm out.
people are coming back into the workforce as the unemployment rate comes down, but they may not necessarily have the same job or as good a job, said sloan. this will be an important option for people still facing job and employment insecurity.
individuals who gave $200 or less flocked to sanders' campaign for the democratic presidential nomination, carrying him much farther than most experts predicted. he drew in 59 percent of his purse from such donors, a staggering amount for a serious white house contender and far more than hillary clinton's 19 percent, though she bested sanders for the party nod.
with tax reform next on the trump legislative agenda, the rich will get a do-over―- to compensate for their silence on the healthcare bill. will one of their number step up to declare, enough with all the tax cuts! and argue for a more equitable tax system? will the rich meet this test, which at bottom is a moral test? will the republicans, their faithful congressional minions?
and medicare for all defenders are fighting back, arguing the polling numbers just show the need to push a counter-narrative about the program's benefits. adam green, co-founder of the progressive change campaign committee, which is backing warren, co-hosted a press call on tuesday showcasing original polling data on medicare for all.
in practice, many of these employers can still seek exemptions because of a different injunction issued by a judge in texas last year that provides similarly broad exemptions to the contraception requirement.
house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) has spent the better part of his political career trying to shred america's social safety net, so that literally tens of millions of americans would lose supports they use to get food, health care and pay their most basic bills.
but that was as far as the similarities went, baucus said.
i'm sure republicans want to change the topic, said jesse ferguson, a democratic consultant who works with groups on the health care issue. if you asked the captain of the titanic, he'd want to change directions too. but after you've already hit the iceberg, it's too late.
but the washington post argued the opposite point in an editorial, saying a court with barrett on it could further undermine faith in the u.s. democratic system if it hands trump victory in a contested election.
pfeifer and dozens of other responders had to spend much of last year traveling to washington to remind all those lawmakers who say never forget to pass a new law before the old one expired.
the use of truvada as prep—pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent hiv—is going gangbusters.
i think all they [kasich and snyder] are doing is what a good lobbyist is supposed to do which is explain the facts, wolf said. we are telling our delegations, 'here are the facts. this is what is going to happen. are you willing to face those consequences if you do this?'
while trump has not endorsed her, he has praised her on occasion at bill signings and other events. those shout-outs are now crucial in her tv ads.
in the course of negotiations, the white house and gop leaders agreed to revise the bill, so that it repeals a set of rules requiring that all insurance plans cover a set of 10 essential health benefits. one of those benefits is coverage for maternity care.
the fact that congress separately repealed the tax makes the argument here not just extravagant but preposterous, said michael dorf, a constitutional law expert at cornell university.
it's totally fluid. sen. bill cassidy (r-la.) on the health care talks
while states that participate may request additional federal medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. under traditional medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.
thanks in no small part to those decisions, the number of people without insurance dropped dramatically after the law took full effect and the marketplace has remained relatively stable, with nearly a dozen insurers offering coverage and premiums rising moderately from year to year.
carson made his official campaign debut in may, marking his first run for public office. he steadily rose to the top of the polls shortly before the third republican debate in late october, pushing out rival and business mogul trump.
during the forum, biden talked about health care as a moral and practical imperative, pointed to his long record of supporting government-led expansions of insurance and told stories about middle-class americans struggling with their medical bills. but, biden warned, passing comprehensive reform on a party-line vote wouldn't work. anyone who thinks we're going to take $2 trillion of the economy, with stakeholders in that $2 trillion, and by a single vote and move it from here to here [gesturing] is kidding themselves, biden said. it's not going to happen.
perhaps trump's position is best summed up by a july interview with cnn, in which he said, [obamacare's] gotta go. ... repeal and replace with something terrific.
think 14 times more people than than this photo of a march in washington d.c. shows:
he wants the candidates to talk about how they will address insurance companies' policies on pre-existing conditions. he has been licensed in insurance for the past 30 years and hated telling clients that their premiums were going to skyrocket because they had diabetes.
so when politicians say never forget this year — or tweet it on sunday, as they all will surely do — the meaning of those words is somewhat different for people who still live the consequences of 9/11. there is no forgetting. for them, the words are a reminder of what congress put them through, and continues to put others through.
in the african-american community where a lot of these felonies are, they do not inform them that they can vote when they get out, said bookhart, who is african-american.
#6: unify against the greater threat.
here is the fact-free theology one supports every time one votes for a republican candidate for president, senator or representative:
but without some new action on health care from washington ― the kind that would guarantee affordable coverage for everybody, regardless of health status and income ― there will be a lot more stories like theirs. and sometimes the endings of those stories will be worse.
i'm going to release them as soon as we can, trump said, once again claiming, as he did in the 2016 campaign, that an audit of the returns prevented him from disclosing the records.
additionally, national providers such as ati physical therapy are already integrated with the va and providing convenient care options for veterans that reduce the strain on va resources.
as this debate unfolds, va secretary david shulkin, this week, said he wanted to eliminate the mileage and wait time restriction for the veterans choice program making it easier for more veterans to use.
correction: the highlighted quotes came from aetna emails sent in the summer of 2016, not 2017.
stephanopoulos challenged him on how his plan would differ from obamacare, if both are aimed at making sure everyone is insured and would involve government help. trump said it was true -- i want people taken care of, he said, adding that maybe cruz has no heart. but trump said he does not want a single-payer system.
in this context, it's important to recognize that the new health care company amazon, jpmorgan chase and berkshire hathaway are launching has been prompted by their own dissatisfaction with current private market options. their plan offers a critique of what free market capitalism has generated, not an indictment of the federal government.
q: what exactly are the 2020 democrats proposing?
amanda terkel and jennifer bendery contributed reporting.
on october 24, 1999, trump interviewed on meet the press and said, i'm very pro-choice. i hate the concept of abortion... but you still... i just believe in choice. it may be a little bit of a new york background... i am pro choice in every respect.
tom steyer, a potential 2020 presidential candidate and one of the democratic party's biggest donors this cycle, is preparing to spend more than $4 million on digital ads targeting more than 4 million young voters in the final weeks before the midterm elections.
conservatives have long attacked president obama over his views of our historical development. among countless other examples, on july 16, 2012, rush limbaugh said that the president despises the country and the way it was founded and the way in which it became great. having read almost every word barack obama published or uttered publicly through mid-2012, and much of the rest since then, i can tell you that such a patently false statement only confirms senator al franken's measured, sophisticated assessment of limbaugh.
kelly had a huge fundraising advantage over mcsally in the race, part of a green tsunami boosting democrats' chances of retaking the senate. in his final campaign disclosure, the democrat said he raised $16 million more than the republican incumbent.
now, james has taken to championing what he calls nonpartisanship. he refused to take a clear position on the recent supreme court vacancy, stating in a campaign email, we need to get back to those times where people from both political parties worked together.
that may be a great deal for people who make a lot of money, giving them a big new tax break. but anyone with a low income or middle income may still find health insurance unaffordable -- and that's especially true for those who earn so little that the cost of insurance is higher than what they owe in taxes. and this would be enormously expensive for the government, because it would deprive the treasury of a tremendous amount of revenue.
underscoring the republicans' confidence, graham set an initial committee vote on the nomination for thursday, the last day of hearings, which would allow final approval by the full senate by the end of the month.
blaque: should preexisting conditions ― which obamacare brought into ― brought to fruition ― be removed… trump: no. blaque: please stop and let me finish my question, sir. should that be removed, within a 36- to 72-hour period, without my medication, i will be dead.
he envisions the group being as willing to provide supportive policy and political advice to the effort to pass a state-level single-payer plan in washington state as it is to help implement more modest coverage expansion initiatives in places like virginia.
the only other policy in virginia similar to uva's is that of vcu health, a sister state hospital system with the same income and asset guidelines. in july, vcu started offering help to some patients with catastrophic and prohibitively expensive bills who don't otherwise qualify, a spokesman said.
state attorneys general will step in to defend the law from this new challenge. and they will not have difficulty making their case.
rice was diagnosed in 2012. at the time, her spouse, charlie crawford, had job-based health insurance. she sought to join their plan when the company coincidentally opened up its health benefits to spouses and family members a few months after rice began experiencing symptoms. but, after a year of paperwork, red tape and appeals, the answer was no. rice's cancer was a preexisting condition, the insurance company said, and it wouldn't cover her.
so, i think what we're saying here is not washington-speak for everything must be paid for, but it's the fact that we can't provide our citizens and our residents of our country what we want if we don't focus on costs, if we don't focus on the fact that an emergency room visit costs several thousand dollars, etc., etc.
she's up against kevin nicholson, a veteran with degrees from ivy league universities who also presents himself as a conservative. nicholson is, however, also the former president of the national college democrats of america who spoke at the 2000 democratic national convention. supporters say he's a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while detractors say he's an opportunist who can't be trusted.
the effort to jam republicans with an embarrassing vote on health care ahead of the election is only the latest among democratic hardball tactics in the fight over trump's supreme court nominee. senate democrats know they can't stop barrett's confirmation as long as republicans remain united behind her, but they're doing what little they can procedurally to delay it as much as possible and punish gop senators for advancing a nominee this close to the election.
and now mcconnell is openly fretting about losing republican control of the senate.
washington ― the lawmakers on capitol hill opened their mouths and said the words again as they prepared to leave town for the weekend that would mark 15 years since terrorists flew planes into the world trade center.
he said it doesn't hurt that trump has brought repealing the affordable care act back to the forefront, with the department of justice now taking the position that the courts should strike down the entire law. and most republicans huffpost talked to tuesday agreed.
for all that money spent, few in real life have offered their own tongues in response, at least to harlem united. a disappointing 60 to 90 people access prep from the organization at any given time.
the trump administration filed a brief thursday night calling on the u.s. supreme court to invalidate the affordable care act — which allows millions of americans to get health insurance coverage — just as the nation smashed a record for new covid-19 cases in a single day.
however, some people pointed out that trump was being strategic with the tweet.
simply telling the narrative of the report itself will come as news to most americans, because most americans understandably have not read a 408 page report, connolly told huffpost. and so when they hear the details, just even if he reads the report, it is going to be new information ― and devastating information ― about this president.
if that sounds like like something democrats might resist, it probably should. graham's idea of democrats jumping aboard seems more aspirational than real.
most assuredly, he replied when asked whether he could envision his central texas hospital going under. we're not using our reserves yet, but i can see them from here.
kavanaugh would not say whether he would recuse himself from any supreme court cases involving president donald trump's criminal or civil liability, citing judicial independence.
the insurance companies rely on the fact that a person with a legitimate grievance is not going to be able to log the amount of time and the bureaucratic red tape they put you through, she added.
without this medication, any one of us could die because of the severity of the disease, she said. buckholt shared her story at the democratic national convention in august.
of course, there is another, less machiavellian theory about why chaffetz re-endorsed the president: he honestly isn't that troubled by him. and every day he shrugs off the latest trump abuse of power, that theory looks a bit more convincing.
senator, i am following the precedent set by the eight justices currently sitting on the supreme court. to put it in the words of justice kagan, who was asked some of the same questions, it would be inappropriate to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down, kavanaugh said.
cap's idea does not envision everybody with private insurance giving up their current coverage, as sanders has proposed, but at least some people would end up losing their existing coverage. if the experience with the affordable care act proved anything, that transformation is frequently a traumatic experience ― for the people who go through it and for the political system as well.
abbott allowed bars in the state to reopen starting may 22, at 25% indoor capacity. he reversed the decision on friday, issuing an executive order restricting business activity in the state. the order grants indoor religious services an exception from the occupancy limit.
trump became a real republican at the very worst time ― a time when republican orthodoxy could not be less wanted by the american people, enjeti said. that is why you see such devastation in terms of his public support ― even among people who supported him last time.
travel required. some weekend work. a second residence is recommended.
when i glanced at my accumulated messages, i could see that some had read my message as i'd meant it, but nobody i was into. something about this election had brought on a fresh surge of desperation in us all, and i was looking forward to the break. and just then — yes, while logged in for the purpose of deactivating my profile — came the most intriguing message i'd ever gotten in 10 years of online dating.
7. jeff sessions, attorney general. last week's ranking: 7
there are a lot of politicians who say, 'oh, it's just not possible. we just can't do it,' warren said wednesday. what they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it.
if steyer doesn't secure the nomination, leakes is considering voting for trump again.

tipirneni's biggest individual national booster may be ady barkan, an als-stricken activist who leads the progressive center for popular democracy action. barkan, who played a lead role in capitol hill protests against the gop tax cuts, traveled to the district to campaign for tipirneni ― and press lesko about her stances on cutting major social insurance programs.
anybody even dimly aware of recent history ― specifically, the part where democrats passed the affordable care act, only to have republicans spend eight years trying to repeal it ― should recognize the claim as a lie.
this time around, medicare for all is the standard against which all the democratic candidates' plans are measured. there's also a very real chance that, for the first time since harry truman, democrats will nominate a presidential candidate who actively supports the creation of a universal, national health care system.
for her part, lesko has touted her conservative bona fides and devotion to trump's agenda, not least on the hot-button issue of immigration.
trump's gop allies generally issued only faint praise if commenting at all. senate budget committee chairman mike enzi, r-wyo., called it just a list of suggestions while top house budget committee republican steve womack of arkansas took aim at its rosy predictions of economic growth and lower interest rates, both of which help trump's budget add up.
does access really matter more than coverage? absolutely.
the huffington post a few of the people trying to get into the trump rally this week in harrisburg, pennsylvania.
she's running on a public option for health care, funding public schools, protecting women's health privacy and the pro-lgbtq equality act. her platform is carefully worded to avoid explicit mentions of abortion or gun access. marshall, a staunchly pro-life ob-gyn, meanwhile, has been trying to appeal to trump's base, advocating to repeal and replace obamacare and building a southern border wall.
in the end, trump's disinterest in challenging the republican consensus on health care saddled him with all the political baggage of repeal and none of its supposed benefits. the opposition of three republican senators tanked the repeal bill in the senate, depriving him of a tangible accomplishment even as the negative publicity from his pursuit of repeal contributed to republicans' loss of the house in november 2018.
the harris plan does have a financing component. it would apply an income-related premium, as the sanders plan would, but set a higher income threshold, $100,000 per household, for when those premiums kick in. the harris plan would also use money from a new tax on investment trades.
very nervous, is how a key rnc member described the consensus within the party, on condition of anonymity. there's not a whole lot that can be done. a lot of it depends on the national mood, and we don't know what that's going to be.
we know the more quickly congress tries to move on something, the more prone they are to making mistakes and to writing a bill that has unintended consequences, said molly reynolds, an authority on congressional procedure at the brookings institution.
a co-worker had lent santoro the textbook that she and her boyfriend used for her botched abortion. for other women in the pre-roe era it was a sympathetic family doctor, or a sorority sister, or a friend of a friend of a friend who provided the key. today, they go online.
in august 2017, following the senate gop's failure to repeal obamacare, only 47% of trump voters believed that the president had the support of most of his party.
but as promise keepers, the party failed its fundamentalist flock. abortion remains legal; gay marriage became a right; the constitution prevents government from enshrining religious preferences as law. so there was nothing to stop evangelicals from noticing that their own lives were often harder and less secure.
biden's plan would enroll these people into the new public option automatically. that'd make a huge difference, especially in big states like florida, georgia and texas that have not embraced the expansion.
bevin has also made a threat that if he can't get his way on the work requirement and other changes, he will go ahead and roll back the expansion after all. that would leave a much larger number of kentucky residents, perhaps approaching half a million, without health insurance.
try to get a little bit more on the grassroots level. and that's for me, i see events, but i don't see [where] they were advertised. so when i see them it's like, 'oh man, if i had known that was going to be, i would have gone,' she said.
fighting to keep senate seats in texas and tennessee was never in the gop's game plan (nor in anyone else's wildest imagination).
pete and the other folks attacking her on health care have taken a lot of money from the health care industry, lux added.
asked if the repeal would be in danger if dent really had a majority of the tuesday group committed to preserving the medicaid expansion, house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) told huffpost that it would indeed be a problem.
what conservatives view as improvements, however, are clear losses for moderates. a large bloc of rank-and-file republicans could flee from the bill, especially if it's clear by friday afternoon that republicans, as is likely, don't have the votes for passage.
abbott urged texans to wear a mask, wash their hands, stay 6 feet apart from others in public, and stay home if they can.
a slew of additional studies have reached similar conclusions. and all are consistent with two of the most thorough studies in the field ― one from oregon and one from massachusetts ― that found clear, solid evidence that giving people insurance improved their access to care and financial security. (the effects on health are more ambiguous, but that's a story for another time.)
this rate shock has been a source of anger since the law took full effect in 2014. the new wrinkle ― which has given trump an opening to focus on obamacare these past two weeks ― is this year's increases. obamacare has basically been hit with a perfect storm. insurers everywhere expected healthy people to sign up in greater numbers than they did. and a key program designed to protect insurers from losses in the program's early stages expires this year.
the issue is now at center stage in missouri, where voters on tuesday will decide whether the state should expand medicaid in a referendum. like in the other 38 states that have expanded coverage as part of the affordable care act, adults making up to 133% of the federal poverty level, about $16,612 annually for an individual, would qualify for the program, with the federal government picking up 90% of the tab. that could mean 460,000 additional missourians would qualify for medicaid.
cruz has had to defend his eligibility for the presidency in recent weeks after trump questioned him about being born in canada. (cruz was born to u.s. citizens and is legally able to run for president of the united states.)
interestingly, san francisco topped the list of least affordable, with a mammoth salary of $180,600 needed in order to purchase the average property costing $1,119,500 and live comfortably. second and third on the list were san jose and los angeles. and overall, californian cities took four places in the top five, with washington dc fourth and san diego coming in fifth.
this is not to say that berners would necessarily vote for the republican nominee instead of backing hillary -- unless your sole issue is being anti-establishment, i find it hard to believe that someone who likes bernie sanders would vote for trump or cruz, who sanders has nothing but disdain for. but without a candidate who they believe in who truly inspires them, some berners may simply do what a huge percentage of americans do on election day -- stay home. this is especially true for young, first-time, infrequent voters, or anyone who's never developed the voting habit.
when a labor department investigator explained the law to management, polywood's representatives admitted they had failed to meet the requirements. one company official asked the investigator if an employer is really at the mercy of any nursing mother.
this would result in a 50 percent increase in the national uninsured rate, boosting the number of people without coverage by 17.1 million, according to an analysis by the urban institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
she's tried really hard to make herself over. she's reinvented herself, from the flaming left liberal she was, mcsally said. you're going to see that in the general election. me in uniform, sinema in a pink tutu.
a more likely scenario ― the actual bare minimum ― is that republicans do nothing. the trump administration could continue to make the csr payments or could end them and truly throw the obamacare exchanges into chaos. trump has the csr payments as leverage to extract concessions on other priorities, like his wall along the mexican border in an omnibus spending deal, and he could make the subsidies contingent upon an item like that funding.
brendon smialowski/afp/getty images supreme court justice sonia sotomayor attempted to correct the record about the affordable care act during oral arguments in zubik v. burwell, march 23, 2016.
it was the second time in as many days a judge declared that president donald trump had taken his war on obamacare too far, exceeding executive authority and violating the intent of several laws.
reps. brendan boyle (d-pa.) and john yarmuth (d-ky.) offered up the simplest, brutal takedown of the obamacare repeal, and explained why it would be so hard.
i think he's sticking too closely to the breitbart talking points. that's fine with the base, but it's not a broad governing strategy, ruddy said. i think it may take the loss of the house, the senate, or both, for him to reconsider the strategy.
that approach has worked for trump, who won kentucky by 30 percentage points in 2016 and remains popular there. but it hasn't worked for bevin, whose support has plummeted not only among democrats, who despise him, but also among moderates and members of his own party. nearly 40% of republicans backed bevin's little-known opponent in may's primary, and one gop state legislator has endorsed beshear. a late push from trump, who tweeted his support of bevin in late october, has bolstered his approval among republican voters, a recent morning consult poll showed, though it's still modest.
estimates suggest that while medicare for all really would mean virtually every person in the u.s. has health insurance, an incremental plan like biden's would still leave about 10 million without coverage. medicare for all would also mean zero out-of-pocket costs for everybody, not just low-income americans, and more aggressive cost control.
it could be a sign of desperation by a party that knows health care is an issue that could deprive it of its power bases in washington and so many state capitals. but it could also reflect confidence that just like trump, who got elected in 2016 despite his own obvious dishonesty on health care, they too can prevail at the ballot box this november ― and then get back to work a few weeks later, tearing down the very same protections they keep vowing to preserve.
but the wonder isn't so much how she's going to vote as why there's any doubt: a close reading of collins' record strongly indicates she will be a yes on kavanaugh. the only question is how much political cover she can give herself.
democratic voters have some important decisions to make about which plan and which candidate can do the most to make health care more affordable. every proposal now on the table has its pluses and minuses, and the voters need to understand those trade-offs.
look, i'm 51 years old. i only want to work on the things that matter. i've been exposed to a lot of great things. i believe there are a lot of really critical things that need to be shown to work, like [the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly] and other kinds of things that would be good for treatments in different communities. separately ― this is a different interview ― i could name you a couple companies that i have seen that i am impressed with.
well i think it's time for all of us who are empathetic, civil, decent, educated and have all our teeth, to take back the america that we cherish.
parnell faces much steeper odds than ossoff, which explains the contest's relative obscurity.
fraley said the county party has restructured and added five deputy chairs and created six new committees. the influx of new people is making the party younger, he said: about two-thirds of them came through sen. bernie sanders' (i-vt.) campaign, many of them encouraged by his organization our revolution to do so.
house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) has blasted republicans for their apparent repeal-and-delay approach.
kavanaugh did not answer, saying he does not know who works at the kasowitz, benson torres law firm.
it's a powerful sight for him just to see him and his partner go throughout the united states together, hand in hand, spreading the same message of basically love and peace and unity, jones told huffpost inside the library of the harriet hancock lgbt center, a resource space for columbia's queer community.
medicare goes away as you know it. all the medicare you have is gone, biden said as he leaned down toward moderator kathie obradovich from the des moines register for effect. the transition of dropping 300 million people on a new plan ― totally new ― is, i think, kind of a little risky at this point.
i sat there looking at the order slips, my brain trying to prioritize them into urgent versus can wait until i find some more money. noting my hesitancy, the doctor asked if i had any questions.
in sum, the gop health care legislation falls far short of president donald trump's promises of insurance for everybody. just what the effects of this bill would be on the federal budget and the number of americans with health coverage isn't yet known, because house republican leaders are poised to move the measure forward before the scorekeepers at the congressional budget office have made an assessment. and the bill doesn't say how it would pay for its spending after scrapping the taxes that financed the affordable care act.
i have visited the laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. these are the forgotten men and women of our country. people who work hard but no longer have a voice, he declared. i am your voice.
democrats offered seven trump-related amendments — covering issues ranging from the trump hotel lease with the general services administration to legal restraints on the president's ability to issue executive orders ― to the committee's oversight plan. chaffetz and republicans on the committee adopted zero of them.
i haven't seen that in committee actually, he snarked about the whiteboard. i've seen it for a long time on tv.
blue cross blue shield association health insurance exchange customers are more likely to have a serious chronic illness like hiv than blue cross blue shield policyholders prior to the affordable care act, according to the industry group.
making bets with rival congressmen when your area sports team is competing for a championship
he said it was always great to be talking about market-based solutions to health care, and while he said it was also politically helpful to be contrasting the republican plan with democratic proposals that would end employer-provided insurance, he said he didn't have a problem with gop efforts to kill obamacare suddenly dominating the discussion.
in order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance ― a penalty that was part of the affordable care act until congressional republicans and trump eliminated it, effective this year. this would make california the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; massachusetts, new jersey and vermont already have such a policy in law.
but undoing obamacare benefits that already exist is another matter entirely.
democrats have a lot of work to do
it doesn't have to be this way. the biggest problems at nursing homes right now reflect three clearly identifiable deficiencies: not enough testing, not enough protective gear and not enough workers.
the solutions with the greatest promise tend to share a theme familiar from hiv care strategies for african americans: taking care of the whole person. this means seeking to address the many life challenges, or so-called structural barriers, standing in the way of black msm using prep successfully, including accessing food, housing and employment, coping with racism and homophobia, and obtaining health insurance.
but murkowski said she will ultimately vote to confirm barrett, calling her qualified for the job.
bret stephens, the newspaper's foreign affairs columnist and deputy editorial page editor, called out hannity for saying he was getting a little sick and tired of republican leaders who weren't doing enough to support donald trump:
the war on pre-existing condition protections
to trump's critics, none of this is the least bit surprising.
she was supposed to be a russian bot. that seemed like the best explanation for @amymek. no normal person could be so prolific and prejudiced.
he said democrats twice removed the word god from the pledge of allegiance at their convention. two individual caucus meetings outside the main prime time programming did leave it out, but it was uttered in every prime time event.
and democrats say all the talk of collapse weakens the gop's ability to carry out that sabotage in a manner that won't be painfully obvious to the public and easily highlighted by democrats.
collins' tendency to stick with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), trump and the republican party on key votes ― including voting for trump's tax bill in 2017 and, in 2018, voting to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court despite several sexual misconduct allegations against him ― has sparked backlash.
texas gov. greg abbott (r) on friday expressed regret for opening bars too early as the state sees a new surge of coronavirus cases.
breyer and kagan had voted in the private march conference to uphold the new medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. but they were pragmatists. if there was a chance that roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of obamacare ― and negotiations in may were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition ― they were willing to meet him partway. when ginsburg found out about roberts' new position, her first thought was, it ain't over till it's over. she understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.
4. milliman, 2015 milliman medical index. may 2015.
this effort is part of a confounding political strategy. one can only presume, despite unequivocal polling to the contrary, that republicans believe relentlessly attacking womens' abilities to make their own health care decisions is popular and will help them win elections. i believe it is at their peril that they pursue this anti-women agenda.
i thought they were going to give me some antibiotics, he said.
in many restaurant cases, workers who asked for time to pump were told there was no one to cover for them. managers at ihop diners broke the law in two separate cases by denying servers breaks. one worker at an ihop in oklahoma said her general manager declined her requests for even a few minutes to pump, telling her curtly, not right now, or later. she eventually developed mastitis.

covid-19 was not the only issue on which voters could judge trump. and on some issues, like the economy, voters overall seemed to approve of his job performance. wages were on the rise before the pandemic and the covid-19 relief package, which trump signed, went a long way toward maintaining living standards, especially for lower-income workers.
and even if republicans are hurt by embracing trump, much of it is cold comfort for progressives and all who care about the future of america. collins may pay a price in 2020 for voting to confirm kavanaugh, but we'll still be stuck with kavanaugh and a radical shift of the supreme court for decades. the country will experience profound change, from the gutting of roe v. wade and threatening lgbtq rights to an expansion of presidential power and further assaults on the environment.
but internal company communications suggest that, in three states, aetna had other motives: it was trying to win approval of its controversial bid to merge with humana.
moore also insisted repeatedly that the affordable care act has made the budget deficit much worse, as he wrote in 2015. republicans have made this claim from the get-go, but there's no reason to think it's true and lots of reason to think it's false.
the campaign to oust bevin began on a blustery, cold day in april 2018, after the governor and republicans in the state legislature forced through changes to an overburdened public pension system for teachers and state workers. decades of teacher frustration over cuts to public education budgets erupted into massive protests in frankfort, the state's sleepy capital city, as thousands of red-clad educators, many of them locked out of legislative proceedings inside, swore to remember in november and drive republicans out of office.
that's ok, though, because when it comes to foreign relations, president trump, stephen bannon, ivanka, and especially jared got this.
raises premiums for older people. the affordable care act limited insurers from charging older customers more than three times what they charge younger adults. the house bill would raise that to five times. this may enable younger consumers to find cheaper coverage, but older policyholders would face higher rates.
insurance companies will be allowed to refuse to sell policies to consumers who fail to make all their premium payments this year. the obama administration gave consumers a 90-day grace period before they could be kicked out for nonpayment. it didn't allow insurers to demand that money be paid back before enrolling people in coverage for the following year. the trump rules permit, but don't require, insurers to collect unpaid premiums.
mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal. much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. we have done a lot of work. $5.6 billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security. quick payback! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 2, 2019
before reviewing the absurd legal arguments of the u.s. department of justice under attorney general jeff sessions, it's important to be clear about what would happen if these republican officials succeed.
bluffton, s.c. (ap) — joe biden is finalizing the framework for a white house campaign that would cast him as an extension of barack obama's presidency and political movement. he's betting that the majority of democratic voters are eager to return to the style and substance of that era — and that they'll view him as the best option to lead the way back.
the point here is not that cummings is insufficiently committed to racial justice or that waters is too friendly with big banks. the point is that accommodating washington's etiquette-minders is a losing game for the democratic party ― because the etiquette itself is rigged against liberals and the american left.
1. christopher steele, the ex-mi6 operative who released the salacious report on trump, is in hiding. the plot thickens. more here.
this is how universal coverage systems in the rest of the world control costs. but here in the u.s., where such controls have never existed on such a widespread basis, lobbying groups representing the health care industry would fight hard to avoid such limits on their payments. and there's good reason to think those lobbyists would prevail ― if not by killing medicare for all outright, then by winning much more favorable terms on payment.
republican candidates are being forced to talk about pre-existing conditions because democrats keep bringing it up.
but there are other routes to universal coverage, one of which was on display wednesday when reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and jan schakowsky (d-ill.) unveiled a new version of legislation they are calling medicare for america.
the 65-year-old congressman has a background that was once very familiar in the 8th district — son of a union ironworker, who followed in his father's footsteps before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and then 19-year congressman. that story still resonates in parts of this district.
the affordable care act prohibited insurers from declining coverage or charging higher premiums to people who already had medical problems or were at high risk of developing them. the law also introduced the mandate, which slaps a financial penalty on people who don't get coverage, giving healthy people more incentive to enroll ― and, in the process, making it easier for insurers to hold down premiums.
this time the discussion didn't go on forever, as it had in previous debates. and just two of the candidates, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and vice president joe biden, did most of the talking.
baucus said he has four overriding concerns with the 2017 bill: it was written in private, no hearings were held on its substance, it gave too much of the tax cuts to the wealthy, and it adds more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.
still, progressives seem to be united on the idea that pelosi ultimately wants many of the same things they want.
she's well-positioned to win the general election, given the strong democratic tilt of the district that comprises several suburbs to the south and southwest of chicago.
the senate leadership fund, the super pac aligned with majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), raised $92 million in september and began october with more than $103 million in the bank, according to a federal election commission report filed tuesday afternoon. this week it announced an additional $5.6 million in ads against peters, bringing its total investment to $14.6 million. democrats have been keeping up the pace.
the 2-1 decision by the three-judge panel is not a full endorsement of that ruling, because it argues that parts of the affordable care act unconnected to the individual mandate might be constitutional. for that reason, the appeals court remanded the case back to u.s. district judge reed o'connor in fort worth, texas, to decide which (if any) parts of the law can stay in force.
trump has also signed two broader budget deals worked out by democrats and republicans to get rid of spending cuts left over from a failed 2011 budget accord. the result has been eye-popping spending levels for defense — to about $750 billion this year — and significant gains for domestic programs favored by democrats. trump's new budget essentially freezes defense at current levels while proposing a 3% military pay hike.
while trump's move to save the carrier jobs ― which happened before he was sworn into office ― was one of the high points of his presidency, braun's campaign hasn't shown interest in reminding hoosiers that the leader of the republican party saved hundreds of good-paying factory jobs.
sullivan's relatively secure in winning that race, said kendall, the former murkowski adviser. if there's a shift such that that race's outcome is in doubt, it will have been because there is a tectonic shift nationally that somehow drags sen. sullivan down.
moulton's view of bipartisanship as an end unto itself seems to have led him to some strange conclusions about the political landscape.
dsh cuts: the draft bill eliminated all obamacare disproportionate share hospital cuts. the released bill only does so for non-expansion states.
any change in our health care system has to be done pragmatically and incrementally, he said.
the campaign's two closing ads focus on the ahca's rollback of federal protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. the law would allow states to opt out of community rating regulations in obamacare that require insurers to provide coverage at regional rates for people in the individual insurance market, rather than charge much higher premiums for people with past illness or other health histories the insurance industry has called pre-existing conditions. those states that choose to opt out would have to create high-risk pools to cover those people, but conservative and liberal experts alike believe the federal funding for those pools would be woefully inadequate.
an obstacle to progress in these states has been ambivalence, or outright hostility, from republican state officials in charge of implementation. it is gop politicians who, taking advantage of leeway they got from a supreme court decision, have refused to expand their medicaid programs as the affordable care act's architects had intended. it is gop officials who have declined to promote enrollment aggressively.

why sharing ministries are suddenly so popular
trump's campaign has not yet released its may fundraising numbers, but the president, the republican party and aligned super pacs have built war chests exceeding the fundraising numbers for biden and the democrats.
some of the people who were smack in the middle of the 2017 debate can vouch for that account. among them is alexander, who is a key player in the party's health policy decision-making. congress specifically repealed the individual mandate penalty, alexander said in june, but i didn't hear a single senator say that they also thought they were repealing protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
he acknowledged that another trump-bashing host, michael medved, was fired because he, too, drove away audience. he added that he did not have to have similar discussions with other hosts, such as hugh hewitt, because they figured it out for themselves.
susan collins must be freaking out.
democrats blasted daniel jorjani, the nominee to serve as the interior department's top lawyer, during a confirmation hearing thursday for his 2017 email telling agency colleagues that our job is to protect the secretary from ethics probes and bad press.
what's possible, at least in the near term for any democratic president, seems extremely limited.
without those regulations, of course, insurance would again be unavailable or effectively useless to many people with the most serious medical needs. fear of that possibility is one reason the public turned against repeal as decisively as they did, despite the affordable care act's problems. but republicans have found ways to undermine those regulations anyway, primarily by allowing the sale of alternative forms of health coverage not subject to the affordable care act's rules.
we had an opportunity of a generation, pelosi told huffpost recently. we were not passing it by.
big picture, it restores all the things we wanted, said shilpa phadke, the vice president of the women's initiative at the center for american progress, who's been pushing to close the loopholes in the previous stimulus packages.
everybody agrees that obamacare doesn't work. premiums & deductibles are far too high - really bad healthcare! even the dems want to replace it, but with medicare for all, which would cause 180 million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. the republicans..... — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 2, 2019
he has said that attacking freedom of the press is how dictators get started, and lashed trump in march for congratulating vladimir putin for winning a sham election.
washington ― sen. susan collins' (r-maine) vote for hearing from new witnesses in president donald trump's impeachment trial wasn't enough to make a difference in the result, particularly given her vote to acquit him on wednesday.
state campaign finance watchers estimate the price tag of the race could be more than $100 million by election day.
this line could become price's if you like your plan, you can keep it moment ― a sweeping sound bite that ends up being not true. (president barack obama eventually had to apologize for his promise in 2013.)

the republican plan to repeal and replace the affordable care act would increase the number of americans without health coverage by 24 million and reduce the federal budget deficit by $337 billion by 2026, according to a congressional budget office and joint committee on taxation report published monday.
still, it worked out better than many expected. so naturally, the administration is considering a ban on the solution that insurers and states came up with to protect subsidized consumers.
the buttigieg plan has a lot in common with a proposal from the urban institute, a well-respected, left-leaning think tank in washington, that its researchers said would require about $1.2 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years (though some of that would be offset by lower state government spending).
to be against fracking is like being against a cure for cancer, he said in a 2016 appearance on c-span2′s book tv. he falsely claimed that the environmental protection agency had found no cases of water contamination from fracking and said students have been indoctrinated in their high school classes to oppose the drilling technique.
the aca includes provisions to make that happen, including tax credits (which make insurance cheaper) and the individual mandate (which penalizes people who don't get comprehensive coverage). but in states where officials have not done their part, enrollment among healthy people has lagged and insurers have jacked up premiums in response ― making coverage flat-out unaffordable for some of the people who don't qualify for tax assistance.
unity: biden, along with new jersey sen. cory booker and a host of centrist elected officials, are unapologetic about working with republicans and believe they can still advance democratic goals even while compromising with the gop.

hopp explained there is an appeal process at samaritan ministries. members can ask a panel of 13 randomly chosen individuals to review a claim. he said there have only been four such incidents in the past two decades with his group.
the organization found that people with obamacare coverage are more likely to have chronic medical conditions like hiv, hepatitis c and diabetes than the customer based they served before obamacare.
now comes the center for american progress, known for reflecting and shaping the democratic party's consensus, with a proposal that would be among the more ambitious ideas out there ― while still less sweeping than what sanders has in mind.
here's the exciting thing: over 70 percent of the people in both parties, or independents ― forget politicians, forget washington for a second ― believe that every american should be able to have access to affordable health care coverage. that is very far from where the conversation in washington is.
yes, amy coney barrett is a successful working mother. currently a judge on the 7th u.s. circuit court of appeals, barrett was nominated by president donald trump to the supreme court just last week. she has seven children, ages 8–18. clearly, this is someone who's doing well for herself professionally while raising a family.
democrats made defending the law a powerful messaging tool in the campaign for the november elections, in which they won a decisive 38-seat majority in the u.s. house of representatives.

even people who felt worse off in the transition to medicare for all might be grateful for the switch later on. that 30-year-old with a bronze policy today could be in real trouble if they got hit with serious medical expenses, given that deductibles on bronze plans can approach $7,000. and under medicare for all, the 30-year-old would probably have more choices of doctors and hospitals. bronze plans are famous for their tiny provider networks.
nodding your head at key moments
the trouble is, it probably wouldn't accomplish anything. health insurance companies aren't clamoring for this freedom -- and some even oppose it. that's because one of the primary functions of a modern health insurer is to create local networks of doctors, hospitals and other providers their customers can go see. an insurer based in alabama, for example, would have to expend a lot of time, effort and money to sell coverage to customers in, say, pennsylvania.
at the event in maquoketa, iowa, ernst could not name any specific proposals. she would only say that she intends to keep two key provisions of the health care law: one that allows children under the age of 26 to remain on their parents' insurance plans and another that provides insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
if leadership had not committed to provide additional details to address some of the concerns, only some of the concerns of the freedom caucus, we probably would have taken a much harder line, meadows added.
health insurers spend lots of time, effort, and money trying to attract people who have high odds of staying healthy (the young and the fit) while doing whatever they can to fend off those who have high odds of getting sick (the older, infirm, and the unfit).
a ruling in favor of the state officials or the trump administration ― each of which wants to court to blow up the affordable care act in a different way ― would herald the return of the days when people with any black marks on their medical histories could find themselves uninsurable.
pcori and icer are great resources for patients and their providers. the reports they issue are more reliable than what any internet search can provide. icer is the only independent national resource that offers credible information about the real elephant in the room--the cost of a new drug, particularly as it compares to existing drugs for the same condition. and icer involves patients in making those determinations.
but so far, at least, republicans haven't privatized medicare, repealed the affordable care act, or transformed programs like food stamps into smaller, state-run initiatives. and while most republicans still endorse these proposals, the public does not.
the cbo score, which is expected wednesday, is very important, cassidy said. he stressed that it will help inform policy decisions facing republicans in the senate, and he appeared hopeful that it would steer his colleagues away from the house bill.
it is by no means coincidental that the list of states acting aggressively to regulate short-term plans overlaps heavily with the list of states that have tried all along to make the aca's private insurance reforms work and were the first to expand medicaid, as well.
he's wrong about that. ending the guarantee could mean slightly lower premiums for individual men and much older women, but it would just as surely drive up premiums for women of child-bearing age and their families ― unless it left them paying the full cost of prenatal care and delivery, typically many thousands of dollars, out of their own pockets.
in 2017, richard frank and sherry glied, economists who also served in the obama administration, produced an estimate of what repeal of the aca would mean for opioid treatment. they determined that about 2.8 million americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage.
the latter includes trump and officials in his administration, who have undermined the affordable care act by cutting outreach funds and weakening its insurance rules. it also includes republican officials in states like kansas, kentucky, and tennessee, who have tried, with various degrees of success, to shrink medicaid and to undermine the affordable care act's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
trump has also endorsed candidates seen as weaker general election bets in two other states. he's backing rep. ron desantis in florida, a noted skeptic of special counsel robert mueller's investigation who released an ad fawning over the president. in georgia, his endorsement of secretary of state brian kemp helped seal the deal against lt. gov. casey cagle. republicans fear democrats will be able to claim the center of the electorate in both races.
two-thirds of new drug applications to the fda each year aren't really new, but instead are reformulations or minor modifications of existing drugs or requests for new uses, hyped as new drugs. (6)
a boeing spokesperson said the company nearly doubled the capacity for pumping mothers at the facility after the complaint. because some workers have a long way to travel to the lactation rooms, the company is launching a pilot program in which mobile nursing pod will come to them. the company also added a benefit that allows breastfeeding moms on travel for work to mail their breast milk home at company cost.
rep. alan grayson leads among senate candidates with 55 percent of his campaign funds originating with small donors. the average for senate campaigns: 11.8 percent. grayson is up against fellow democratic rep. patrick murphy for the chance to fight failed gop presidential candidate sen. marco rubio for his seat.
jfc. trump is again this week's number one in republic report's trump team disgracefulness power rankings. trump is not merely a disgrace; he's a total and complete disgrace.
(per recent reports, trump plans to revisit the health care bill before getting to tax reform, so once again the rich will get to reconsider the losers of trumpcare. in this round trump threatens to reduce the federal subsidies that enable poorer people to buy health insurance. will this finally prompt the rich to say, no way?)
although the legislation's supporters don't typically advertise that downside, the more candid ones acknowledge it. they argue it's a necessary trade-off because premiums for iowans who buy coverage on their own, rather than through employers, have increased to the point that many simply cannot afford it today.
though the supreme court may not move immediately to overturn roe, it's likely a conservative majority might allow states to pass more restrictions on the ability to obtain an abortion.
clearly, mcsally's people saw this was trump's primary. she hugged on to trump, said mike noble, a gop pollster in arizona. they've done a much better job of adapting, and they had the resources to adapt.
corlette predicted that under the republican plan, many americans in their 50s and early 60s would be unable to pay for private insurance and would end up going without coverage. that risks driving up medical debt, which could lead to more bankruptcies.
biden's statements didn't come out of nowhere. monday's remarks came as he was rolling out his own health care plan, which, among other things, would bolster the affordable care act by making its financial assistance more generous and available to more people.
meanwhile, the covid-19 pandemic threatens to derail an entire generation of women, pushing them out of the workforce to handle caregiving responsibilities in the home while schools operate virtually or only intermittently. caregiving duties, despite ginsburg's long efforts to include men in the domestic sphere, remain largely viewed as the primary responsibility of women.
spriggs had a similar assessment, saying that although much of trump's appeal lies in pandering to voters with racist views, he has forced democrats to take restoring the middle class more seriously.
the way they passed that bill was so ugly — the way it was put on at the last minute, at the last second, pfeifer said. there was no reason why sick 9/11 guys should have been down there. it should have been a kumbaya moment, where we signed the bill and we all, as bipartisans, got on the capitol steps and praised this thing. but they didn't want to do that. that was wrong.
congresswoman mcsally's calculated shifts have damaged her credibility and prove she doesn't respect voters enough to be honest with them, state democratic party spokesman drew anderson said. arizonans just don't want another shady politician willing to say anything to advance her own career.
just so, the world won't get any hotter if we never say the words global warming again — while our political climate might actually cool if we focus our language on our communal responsibility to be good caretakers of the earth. the same ends can be reached by many means. when we start where we agree, we can get somewhere together in a way that fosters trust and open-mindedness. if our big-ticket policies are truly best, we ought to let the evidence make its own appeal to people who feel heard, respected, and involved.
but on the 5th circuit panel, two republican appointees, jennifer walker elrod and kurt engelhardt, found it persuasive. the third judge, democratic appointee carolyn dineen king, voted to keep the law in place.

then jones, the union president at the time, noticed a bit of a commotion: sen. joe donnelly (d-ind.) had entered the room. he hadn't been expecting a senator to show up, especially since he thought congress was in session back in washington.
walmart finally did install an electrical outlet so the employee could use her electric pump, but it took more than two months ― a third of the time doctors recommend a mother breastfeed her baby exclusively. and by then it was too late. she'd given up on breastfeeding and started feeding the baby solely formula.
i don't think health care is a privilege, he said. it is a right. everybody should have the right to affordable health care.

unions play a major role in getting democrats elected and can easily influence a primary race if they choose to weigh in. but several major unions, including afscme, have said they will take their time in making an endorsement, if they make one at all in the primary. lee saunders, the union's president, said afscme is taking a more deliberate approach than the 2016 election, when leaders quickly got behind hillary clinton over sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.).
on health care, kavanaugh said he couldn't give assurances that he would uphold pre-existing condition requirements under obamacare as constitutional if confirmed to the high court, calling the question a hypothetical.
baldwin ended up firing an aide and disciplined three others over the controversy and introduced legislation intended to address opiate drug prescriptions at the va. votevets, a progressive group, recently went up with an ad trying to counter some of the republican messaging on tomah.
bevin has attempted to gut obamacare, which helped 1 in 9 kentuckians gain access to health care for the first time and is now popular among residents. he has tried to enact severe budget cuts that put dozens of state programs at risk. he has approved tax cuts for big banks while refusing to consider new lines of revenue to help bolster the state's general fund. he has taken aim at kentucky's crisis-stricken and underfunded pension system by trying to transform it into a defined-contribution plan, and bevin and the gop's reforms, some experts and democrats have said, would potentially help funnel millions of taxpayer dollars into risky investments that could both fail to fix the system and further enrich hedge funders and wall street financial advisers.
last october, mccain slammed trump policies and his supporters over the mexican border wall and crackpot conspiracy theories. it's time to wake up, mccain said in a speech at the naval academy. i believe in america. we're capable of better. we're hopeful, compassionate people.
over the course of the entire election cycle, the democratic establishment has had more success elevating its preferred candidates. but even many establishment-backed candidates and mainstream incumbents have either signed onto the once radical positions of medicare for all, free college and a $15 minimum wage or shifted closer to them than would have been imagined as recently as two years ago.
mcconnell cited process on tuesday to tell democrats again that he won't bring a new or standalone bill to the floor to address zika. they will have to accept what came out of conference.
house speaker nancy pelosi (calif.) and other democratic lawmakers will unveil plans on tuesday to shore up the affordable care act in order to make health insurance more affordable for consumers and reverse steps that president donald trump has taken to undermine the law.
for those who have lost employment, who are affected by illness and may not have family to assist, having a plan like the aca is a must, she said.
asked why republicans were doing this smaller bill tuesday, majority whip john cornyn (r-texas) made it clear that leadership was largely making up the plan as they go.
the democratic party's picks to give responses to president donald trump's first two addresses to congress reflected the state of uncertainty the party found itself in. after giving the 2017 slot to then-72-year-old former kentucky gov. steve beshear — a backward-looking pick if there ever was one — they followed up with the selection of massachusetts rep. joe kennedy, best known for being the scion of the quintessential democratic family.
regardless of the long history of connection between clergy and planned parenthood as well as the clergy's role in the abortion rights movement more generally, those on the right seek to separate those of us in the reproductive rights movement from a sense of deep spirituality and religious connection, meyer said. their binary moral framework leaves no space for individual questions of conscience nor the moral ambiguity that is an inevitable fact of life.
and the last dccc chairman ― ben ray lujan (d-n.m.), who oversaw the dramatic democratic gains in 2018 ― had a similar message: every one of my colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle should be abundantly clear when they're going home to visit with their constituents how devastating president donald trump's priorities and budget are to their families.
i've shot the biggest gun of anybody in congress, she told the man.
don't act as if we're making this stuff up, added sen. richard whitehouse (d-r.i.) in response to gop claims that democrats are simply fearmongering about health care being on the line during the coming supreme court hearing.
the plan had no chance even before trump's impeachment scorched washington. its cuts to food stamps, farm subsidies, subsidized housing for the poor, medicaid and student loans couldn't pass when republicans controlled congress, much less now with liberal house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., setting the agenda.
to help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for america's children. i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave ― so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.

lawmakers emerging from an evening caucus with leaders and trump administration figures said it was still unclear if there would be the votes on friday, but they intended to push ahead anyway.
people are particularly interested in pushing their legislators on policy. he used to have a legislative programs team, which mostly consisted of one staffer from a congressional office who would help be a liaison between the party and government officials. now, that team has 120 people who signed up to do twice-weekly phone banks and engage people in other counties.
republicans who tried but failed to repeal the law under president donald trump are calling the democratic plan a waste of taxpayer dollars. but many democrats see it as merely a down payment on a more ambitious health care agenda.
the family has lots of company: over six years ending in june 2018, the health system and its doctors filed 36,000 lawsuits against patients seeking a total of more than $106 million, seizing wages and bank accounts, putting liens on property and homes and forcing families into bankruptcy, a kaiser health news analysis has found.
funding for the legislation would have to come through some combination of taxes and fees, in lieu of what employers and individuals pay for insurance today, with government regulating the prices of prescription drugs, hospital services and every other type of health care service in order to keep the program's overall costs manageable.
today she splits her time between helping with her 3-year-old granddaughter, who calls her gigi, and searching for a job. she is looking for something in customer service or retail, but at 63, she'd also love a chance to share some of her wisdom about addiction and recovery by working as a peer coach.
at the other end of pennsylvania avenue, congressional republicans were joining the cbo bashing. at a house energy and commerce committee meeting to advance the health care bill, majority whip steve scalise (r-la.) described the congressional budget office as unelected bureaucrats in washington.
asked how democrats should plan to rebuild their fundraising network in the wake of the supreme court's decision in janus v. afscme, which is likely to reduce labor unions' political spending, he claimed he could offer no special insight on fundraising.

the poorest of the poor — those making less than $10,000 — will have no change in their tax rates in 2023 and 2025 compared with before the law, the only group of taxpayers without a tax rate decrease.
you have to understand the pressure these staffs were under, said one lobbyist close to the process. the fate of the republican party rested with them. indeed, they faced the seemingly impossible: research, write, debate, and pass tax legislation that would satisfy donors, corporate supporters, and the party's conservative ideologues — all in five months.
west virginia, where then-president donald trump had won nearly 70% of the vote two years earlier, was seen as a prime pickup opportunity for republicans, as long as they didn't blow it by nominating a toxic candidate like blankenship. at 10:11 p.m., senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's political team fired off a meme meant to reference blankenship's bizarre accusation that mcconnell was tied to cocaine smuggling, fully embracing the kentuckian's newfound cocaine mitch nickname.
moments after hawking made the remark, google reported a sharp increase in searches for the terms demagogue, denominator, and stephen hawking.
they all say, 'oh, yeah, i'm for protecting preexisting conditions.' they'll have a chance to show it.... let's see what they do, schumer told msnbc before the vote on his bill, which he secured in a surprise move that is usually only employed by the senate majority leader.
in delaware, kerri harris, backed by the same justice democrats that helped ocasio-cortez win, is looking to unseat sen. tom carper (d). harris could be the first woman, the first openly lesbian candidate and the first african-american to serve as a delaware senator. a 39-year-old air force veteran, harris is running on a progressive platform calling for universal medicare, more wall street oversight and abolishing immigration and customs enforcement.
this week, barack obama, whom joe biden's presidential campaign is primarily deploying to pennsylvania to encourage voter turnout among black men, cut an ad for peters, highlighting his work on passing the auto bailout, protecting health insurance coverage for those with preexisting conditions and securing more funding for great lakes restoration. unlike most incumbents, who have the advantage of being known in their state, peters started off his reelection campaign as a complete stranger to 36% of the state's population.
trump is counting on the supreme court to eliminate the law, and has faced legal challenges to many of his health policies. many of biden's key proposals, such as the creation of a government-run public option as an alternative to private health insurance, would run into staunch opposition from industry groups. and both face the prospects of a split congress, with democrats controlling the house and republicans controlling the senate, or a majority in the senate not large enough to overcome the filibuster.
but here's another thing about the incredible plan: the biggest boosters of association health plans don't even want to sell them.
and then there are the stories of people in ministries who run afoul of pre-existing condition exceptions. one of them is an illinois couple, bet and erik olson, who adopted two children from ethiopia. their story was the focus a lengthy 2017 investigation by journalist laura turner in buzzfeed. both of the olson's children needed expensive blood work, and one has a disorder that requires expensive medication. their provider, samaritan ministries, rejected the bills as related to a pre-existing condition (and would not answer questions from buzzfeed as to why).
congress has been somewhat slow to adapt to the challenges of remote oversight and lawmaking while being away from the capitol.
correction: a previous version of this story indicated the mayvilles planned to move to idaho permanently this year. while they intend to move to idaho permanently, they have yet to set a date for the move. this story also has been updated to correct kenneth freeman's age and include information about his past political activities.
the transformation came at a cost: insurers, forced to cover bills they had previously avoided, jacked up premiums in response. and although new tax credits offset the increase for most buyers, they don't help everybody. the resulting backlash helped republicans to win elections, giving them a chance to repeal the law.
the 138-page document outlines dozens of recommendations across a variety of areas, including drug prevention and treatment strategies, law enforcement and education. the report itemizes federal drug control spending by function, and notes that trump's proposed 2018 budget would increase funding on interdiction by 10 percent, while cutting prevention spending by 11 percent.
but the mere possibility that the two republicans would invalidate part, let alone all, of the affordable care act is hard to fathom. the consequences of such a ruling would be devastating, and the underlying argument of the lawsuit is, according to a wide array of respectable legal experts, positively bonkers.
job-based health insurance isn't obamacare. while that term is used interchangeably with the affordable care act, the rate increases in question only affect people who use the exchanges, not people who have health coverage from a job or a government program like medicare or medicaid. in fact, premiums for employer health insurance are rising much more slowly.
so whats my take? i personally much prefer the organic way: meeting at a party, at the coffee shop, at whole foods, through friends... but my adventure onto tinder deeply reinforced two things i live by: water seeks its own level -- in other words, we draw to us what we are about.
such a ruling could wreak havoc. protections for people with preexisting conditions would come off the books and roughly 20 million people who now get medicaid or subsidized private insurance would lose it, according to projections from the urban institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization.
yes, in his album of greatest hits, going after barack hussein obama is his single greatest hit, said walsh, who, as a former conservative talk radio host, himself used racial and ethnic slurs against obama, for which he has since apologized. no other dog whistle, outside of going after brown people coming across the border, will rile up his base more.
democrats first started making such vows during the 2008 presidential campaign. the primary purpose was to distinguish their health care proposals from president bill clinton's 1993 proposal, under which most employer plans would have disappeared.
and it's the matchup between evers and walker — whose eight-year tenure has included mass protests of his union-busting bill at the state capitol, followed by a recall attempt and a presidential run — that provides the clearest test of the strategy.
black women have been the backbone of our communities and our economy but have been relegated to the shadows or the back over the past 400 years. state sen. jennifer mcclellan
medicaid programs would have to change in other ways as well, because the affordable care act introduced enhancements like new home-based care options for the disabled and elderly. these initiatives would lose their federal authorization, leaving decisions about whether to continue the programs in the hands of cash-strapped state officials.
i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them, biden added, referring to his democratic primary victory over more progressive rivals.
when pfeifer hears about zika, about flint, about a supreme court seat going empty for months on end, he hears the emptiness of the uttered words and knows the he and other responders are fortunate because congress eventually acted in their case, even if it treated them with callous disregard along the way.
hate tends to run together, which is how an islamophobic jew can find common ground with white supremacists and neo-nazis. mekelburg removed a reference to her jewish heritage in her twitter bio. she'd later praise british fascist jayda fransen and ethnonationalist hungarian prime minister viktor orban, who has used anti-semitism for political gain by casting the hungarian-american jewish billionaire george soros as an evil, globalist puppet master. mekelburg did the same on twitter, often using clips from the kremlin-controlled russia today to attack soros:
among the senators who voted for bcra was sen. john mccain (r-ariz.), who spent part of his day delivering an impassioned floor speech decrying the process and the legislation that he voted for later in the evening. johnson, who withheld his vote earlier tuesday during the motion to proceed until he had a 10-minute conversation on the floor with mcconnell, also ended up voting for the bcra, as did capito, who has made her qualms about medicaid cuts well-known, saying last week that she didn't come to washington to hurt people.
the bill also calls for a far more radical change to medicaid. since its inception in 1965, medicaid has been a federal entitlement like medicare and social security, so the government has been obligated to cover the costs of any eligible person without limit. house republicans want to eliminate this entitlement status and instead send states a flat sum ― known as a per-capita cap ― per enrollee.
but zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don't need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it's assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single american.
in addition, people in states that didn't expand medicaid who have incomes below the poverty level don't qualify for financial help paying for private health insurance.
mcgrath will enter the general election armed with a massive campaign war chest after raising more than $40 million during the primary. her robust fundraising ability has helped fuel hopes among democrats that mcgrath can mount an aggressive bid to unseat the six-term republican senator who has long been the bane of democrats and is now an even bigger target as one of president donald trump's chief washington allies.
in reality, the violations investigators turned up probably reflect only a small fraction of the times women are prevented from pumping at work. one problem, experts say, is the vast number of workers excluded from the protections because they aren't covered by the law.
the local nbc 9 news report on the event was brutal for coffman from start to finish, highlighting berthie ruoff, a breast cancer survivor who is worried she will be unable to buy insurance without the law's protections.
sen. roy blunt (r-mo.) added that the president has moved further in trying to find a balance there than the other side has.
kaiser health news (khn) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. it is an editorially independent program of the kaiser family foundation that is not affiliated with kaiser permanente.
that split still exists, with current democratic presidential hopefuls like sen. amy klobuchar (minn.) and former vice president joe biden as the proponents of a more cautious, incremental approach to achieving universal coverage and lower health care costs.
my administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran.
year after year, countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
though his opponents landed solid blows, biden left few of them unanswered. on health care, for example, the former vice president went on the offense early, aiming his fire at harris and her medicare for all plan that includes a 10-year transition period.
naturally, these customers in the so-called individual market -- comprising the exchanges and people who buy directly from an insurance company or through a broker -- are going to doctors, hospitals, emergency rooms and pharmacies more, too. average monthly costs per enrollee rose in 2015 above where they were in 2014, suggesting the trend isn't abating.
joe kernen: entitlements ever be on your plate?
she looks great in the shot, but we still have questions.
the dccc, nonetheless, massively outpaced the nrcc in online fundraising over the same period, bringing in around $13.7 million compared with the republicans' $1.7 million. the digital fundraising total came from 750,000 individual contributions, including gifts from 121,000 first-time donors, according to the dccc.
while signing the bills, gov. ned lamont stressed that gun violence prevention only goes so far without the federal government's support. in our country, we have a patchwork of gun laws in each individual state – and as they say, we are only as strong as our weakest link. for the safety of our communities, we must demand federal action on this issue, lamont said.
now the case is before the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals, where a panel of three judges will hear oral arguments on tuesday. two of the judges are republican appointees and have ties to the conservative federalist society, just like the federal district judge who ruled in favor of the case in november.
perdue, a close ally of president donald trump, was one of several senators, both democrats and republicans, who came under fire earlier this year after they made high-value stock trades in the days after lawmakers received the first dire warnings about the coronavirus.
trump actually brought up medicare for all, by implication, when he said that former vice president joe biden wanted to get rid of private insurance and introduce socialized medicine. as biden rightly pointed out, he explicitly rejected medicare for all during the primaries ― drawing a clear distinction between him and more progressive candidates, most notably sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.).
so, stephanopoulos asked, how would it work?
this month, the administration signaled it would like to change how the government adjusts its official poverty threshold for inflation every year, which could result in millions fewer americans qualifying for a wide range of benefits over time.
and democrats remain confident in sinema, 42, who has been free to spend millions of dollars promoting herself as a centrist who wants to end the partisan nonsense on health care and other issues. sinema, who has voted with trump more than 50 percent of the time, is counting on her moderate image to win over swing voters.
here too, there is no need to speculate on what the trump administration, and stephen miller in particular, would do if left unchecked. they want us to know, they are challenging us to know: trump administration weighs new family-separation effort at border, reads the headline on a washington post story, which says that senior white house adviser stephen miller is advocating for tougher measures because he believes the springtime separations worked as an effective deterrent to illegal crossings.
it's not like the 2017 vote was an isolated incident. house republicans voted to repeal the affordable care act literally dozens of times before then, always without a replacement. and although repeal ultimately failed when senate republicans came up one vote short of the 50 they needed to pass a bill, there is no reason to think party leaders, including those at the white house, have given up.
for their part, freedom caucus members claim that trump's lack of interest in the policy details of the bill prevented him from accommodating their demands.
in the meantime, the mayvilles, the strizichs and their small army of volunteers will keep knocking on doors. and the warming weather creates opportunities to find supporters at places like the boise farmers market, the treefort music festival, and gun-control rallies planned throughout the state, he said.

i'm not saying we would have closed the day after the election, said adam willmann, the hospital's ceo, but i don't know how much longer we could have gone.
with a little more money, or at least some assurances that the existing money will continue, the worst outcomes of an obamacare market collapse could be avoided.
of course, california has a large budget surplus, thanks to a booming economy and years of thrifty fiscal management. it also has large democratic majorities in each house of the legislature. in other parts of the country and in washington, it would be harder to find the money and political will to shore up obamacare, to say nothing of spending taxpayer dollars on undocumented immigrants.
if you needed an example of how damaging the ahca was to republican re-election efforts, look no further than the 2018 midterms. republicans lost 41 seats in the house, and health care was the top issue on the minds of voters, according to exit polls. even more troubling for the gop, 58 percent of voters said democrats would better protect people with pre-existing conditions, compared with 34 percent who said republicans.

the volume of the outpouring of volunteers has been astounding. lauren necochea, director of idaho voices for children
this isn't a time where the leadership doesn't want the progressive values, khanna said. i think this is a question of negotiation.
regarding that, republicans and conservatives may believe they've passed the point of no return. they know that most business on capitol hill would come to a standstill as we focused on these serious matters ― some of which now deeply implicate them ― and that we'd probably see impeachment hearings.
rep. elise stefanik (r-n.y.) told huffpost that some republicans were working on an alternative health care bill that would protect people with pre-existing conditions, though she admitted one didn't exist yet.
this week's votes are part of a broader effort by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) to dramatically reshape the nation's federal courts while trump is in the white house. he has made confirmations of conservative judges his top priority.
in some ways, biden's embrace of obama's legacy is to be expected. he spent eight years as obama's no. 2, serving as a key congressional liaison and foreign policy adviser, and the two men remain personally close.
combined with obamacare's other features, including subsidies for low- and some middle-income people, this put comprehensive coverage within reach for millions who couldn't get it before. but it also raised premiums for individuals and small businesses who previously were able to find coverage for much less money ― in part because their plans lacked full coverage for mental health, maternity care, rehabilitative services, or prescriptions.
but the tax law will do nothing to close the gap more, and may make it worse, some tax experts said.
if either feingold or nelson had won, democrats would have been able to pass the american rescue plan without manchin's vote, preventing him from negotiating down the size of the unemployment benefits expansion. if both men had triumphed, democrats would be able to pass bills through reconciliation without the votes of either manchin or arizona sen. kyrsten sinema, another moderate democrat.
in late 2017, however, trump, a republican, signed a tax bill reducing the penalty for not buying insurance to zero. the states challenging the law argued that the mandate was no longer a tax, and was therefore unconstitutional.
the reagan-era bill was crafted with lengthy deliberation through its entire process. the 2017 tax act was drafted in such haste that there was no substantive deliberation on its contents, resulting in confusing language and numerous errors that need to be fixed. but newly-empowered democrats are unlikely to help republicans repair their faulty bill, with the result that it may generate even more than the $1.5 trillion ten-year deficit it was designed to create.
3. why are bernie fans so mean to hillary fans?
still, cheaper insurance gets a lot more expensive if you try to use it and find out it doesn't cover what you need. oh, and there's a long track record of association health plans not paying claims and even defrauding their customers.
republicans sense that health care is no longer an issue they own. rep. mike bishop (r-mich.) is in what should be a reliably republican district, but in an election year that's already bringing unexpected wins to democrats, bishop's seat is considered a bellwether that could be up for grabs. last year, his campaign site had a section about repealing obamacare.
this is part of bevin's problem. he does not approach politics with the conservative style that has historically been the norm around here. stephen voss, university of kentucky
notably, inslee and de blasio are potential presidential candidates this cycle, something newsom has ruled out. newsom is in his first days as california governor after winning election in november, while inslee and de blasio are each in their second terms in office.
before mulvaney unseated veteran democrat john spratt in the tea party wave of 2010, the 5th district had been in democratic hands since the end of reconstruction.
none of this is inconsistent, he said. it's all about building to the point where we get to universal coverage.
the expansion is the single biggest reason that, since the law's full implementation, the number of people without insurance has fallen to historic lows. people who get medicaid through the expansion are likely to end up more financially secure, have better access to medical care, and end up in better health generally, research has repeatedly shown.
obamacare taxes: the bill repeals many of the obamacare taxes, but generally on a delayed basis. however, the bill re-imposes the cadillac tax beginning in 2025. the bill does not appear to repeal the economic substance doctrine.
the problem is that housing affordability is such a huge topic, it's difficult to pinpoint where to begin. and to be honest, with so much media focus on what 'ludicrous' statement trump has now made (like, the beauty of me is that i'm very rich...), it's no wonder that real issues such as the desperate need for housing affordability have been shoved to the back of the priority list. but as the election draws to a close, it's time for candidates to push policies that are going to make a real difference.
in a 2000 survey, daily kos asked texas voters if they thought texas would be better off as an independent nation or as part of the united states of america. sixty-one percent of respondents said texas would be better off within the united states while nearly 1 in 3 texans (31 percent) believed texas would be off as an independent nation. when asked in a follow-up question if they agreed with former governor rick perry's suggestion that texas may need to leave the united states, 37 percent agreed and 58 percent disagreed.
it is in court because obamacare is no good, trump said. and if the court does throw it out, he said, he had a plan to give the american people brand new, beautiful health care while always protecting people with preexisting conditions.
associated press rob olson, a republican state senator from kansas, sponsored a bill that would let the farm bureau sell health benefits coverage exempt from the affordable care act's rules and outside the jurisdiction of state insurance regulators.

chip somodevilla via getty images president barack obama, pictured here with his daughters, has pushed for policies like paid parental leave.
the public option would serve another vital function: as a fallback for medicaid. the aca expanded the federal-state program for low-income americans, opening it to anyone whose income is below or just above the poverty line. millions have gotten care that way and, as a large body of research has shown, the result has been better access to care, reduced financial hardship and better health outcomes.
white manhood is mad fragile in our nation, has always been, and by and large has always been defined, at least partially, by its oppression and domination of others. this is the autobiography of america.
the guarantee of coverage for people with preexisting conditions helped marcie paul, 62, and her husband, stewart shevin, to start their own business. job-based health insurance plans usually don't screen for preexisting conditions, but the insurers routinely denied coverage to people based on their medical histories in the individual market before the aca. they would be able to do so again if the gop plaintiffs win the lawsuit.
the republicans were smart enough to disguise the efforts. they made sure legislation included broad, if ultimately meaningless, language about people with pre-existing conditions. they also included some of the law's key provisions, including the prohibition on denying coverage outright to people with serious medical problems. but as experts pointed out time and again, every single proposal included loopholes that insurers could and would exploit.
in october, harrison shattered the record for the highest quarterly fundraising total for a senate candidate in u.s. history, raising $57 million since july. graham raised $28 million. (the prior quarterly record was set by former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who raised $38 million in the final quarter of his 2018 senate race against sen. ted cruz.)
but pepin county also voted for democrat tammy baldwin by 3 percentage points, when she ran for wisconsin's open u.s. senate seat in 2012. so for now, pepin is also baldwin territory, and the people who turned out on presidents day were there to meet with her and figure out how they can help her get re-elected in november.
there's no question that celia bader, who died when ginsburg was in high school, would be proud. ginsburg's work at the aclu opened up new paths for women and helped girls see that they, too, could grow up to become a supreme court justice or president.
the trump bill was created in secret, and many legislators never saw some of its provisions, much less debated them, until it was introduced. the measure contained multiple provisions that don't do what was intended and may take years to fix — if they can be fixed at all, experts say.
but there's a big catch: these unemployed workers must pay the full premium (plus a 2% administrative fee).
the rule didn't go into effect until in 2016, and some insurers already flout it by packaging together multiple plans so they last for a year. still, with the mandate in place, the plans have mostly served a relatively small niche market: those with brief lapses in coverage.
win mcnamee via getty images house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) conceived of the american health care act.
tom delay screamed at bill clinton, fighting the urge to throw something, hager and pianin write, adding that delay sat raging at his television set, calling clinton a 'lying, disingenuous, smarmy son of a bitch.' the trump administration, so far, has not gone the clinton route of talking about individual federal workers and the toll the shutdown is taking on them. democrats in congress, however, have been doing so, in an effort to shame the president and congressional republicans into giving up their border wall demand. instead, trump and his aides have downplayed being furloughed and missing paychecks ― comparing it to a vacation ― and claimed that most federal workers are standing behind him. (there is no evidence of that.) a 2018 shutdown, which lasted just three days, had blame spread more evenly. according to a huffpost/yougov poll, 61 percent of americans surveyed said they blamed congress as a whole, with equal blame going to democrats and republicans (and less to trump). that shutdown was precipitated by senate democrats trying to incorporate into budget negotiations a deal to help the young undocumented immigrants known as dreamers. shutdowns often don't have long-term electoral consequences, though. in the 1996 and 2014 congressional elections, republicans made gains, despite shouldering most of the blame for recent shutdowns. but in 1996, clinton won re-election, defeating dole. and in 2018, democrats took control of the house.
some ministries have annual or lifetime limits, or set other restrictions on what they will cover ― for example, leaving out inpatient psychiatric care. some limit or exclude preventative care, including basic cancer screenings. people who join sharing ministries must generally agree, in advance, to forgo lawsuits and take any disputes to arbitration. usually that means biblically based mediation and arbitration, which is a sometimes controversial method that relies partly on religious law. a member with a problem cannot appeal to state insurance regulators for help, because sharing ministries fall outside their jurisdiction.

although just four of the 20 candidates raised their hands when asked if they supported eliminating private health insurance during the two debates ― sanders, warren, harris and new york mayor bill de blasio ― the very fact that this was the question shows how much has changed since kucinich's opponents could safely brush off the notion of single-payer without alienating democratic primary election voters. (harris later recanted her answer, claiming to have misunderstood the question.)
rural hospital officials appear not to have the slightest hope that the deep red texas legislature and governor will get behind expansion.
as for senate minority leader chuck schumer (n.y.), trump dismissed the democrat as a nasty son of a bitch, bloomberg reported. he pulled out his usual pocahontas slur for sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.).
collins surely knows this. don't believe her portrayal in some quarters as a dupe and political naif wandering innocently among the male political sharks. she has served in the senate for more than two decades. it is more likely that she voted for the tax bill, for instance, because she supported the provisions of the tax bill, whatever their ramifications for obamacare.
in a functioning democracy, republicans wouldn't be able to rely so heavily on their own supporters living inside a closed media universe, and they would need other voters to maintain their congressional majorities.
in the first half of 2012, sandra fluke went from being an unknown student at georgetown university law center to a leading advocate for contraception rights and a rising star within the democratic party.

but a congressional budget office analysis of bcra said it would do just that, leading to 22 million fewer people with insurance and raising prices substantially on older, low-income americans.
in 1970, three years before roe v. wade, new york state passed the most liberal abortion law in the nation — allowing unrestricted access to abortion up to 24 weeks, and thereafter only to save the life of the mother. unlike the handful of other states that allowed abortion in some circumstances, new york had no residency requirement. in the first six months that it was in effect, more than 139,000 abortions took place in the state, with 80 percent of the patients coming from out of state.
but during the seven months arkansas carried out the policy, nearly one-quarter of those who had to abide by the rule lost their benefits. studies show the policy didn't increase employment, but it did lead to higher medical debt.

washington gov. jay inslee, who has focused his campaign on climate change, drew blood in an exchange with biden over his unwillingness to phase out u.s. reliance on fossil fuels quickly enough.
six years after president barack obama enacted the affordable care act, the law has extended health coverage to an estimated 20 million people and driven the uninsured rate to a historic low, and the health insurance industry and other players in the private health care sector have adapted to the law, however awkwardly.

the volume of the outpouring of volunteers has been astounding, and they've made remarkable progress just using volunteers, necochea said. idaho voices for children is weighing how it can ramp up its involvement in the campaign separate from the coalition, she said.
the law's architects understood that process would take time, however. that's one reason they were determined to make private coverage more affordable the right away ― by offering people tax credits to offset the cost of premiums and, in some cases, out-of-pocket costs.
the progressive caucus tried to extract some concessions for this bill during the last coronavirus relief bill, threatening to hold back votes for phase 3.5 if state and local government funding weren't included in the next bill. ultimately, they got soft assurances from the speaker and voted for the bill, which overwhelmingly passed 388-5.
i don't think it makes any sense, and i think [ryan]'s trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the president, paul told boyle.
it's totally fluid, he said, adding that he has no clue when the senate would even be ready to bring a bill to the floor.
iowans whose incomes qualify for the law's tax credits may not notice the difference. they'll still be able to get comprehensive, regulated policies through healthcare.gov, usually at low prices. and iowans with higher incomes, the ones who didn't get the tax credits, will discover they have a much cheaper alternative. many will feel genuine relief, even if the plans don't provide as much coverage.
although three senate republicans have called for the government to reopen, most are sticking by trump ― even despite the loss of public support.
to understand how we got here and what the state gop leaders and the u.s. department of justice are arguing, it's necessary to review what happened the first two times conservatives turned to the courts to undo the affordable care act and what has happened since.
virtually any change in insurance rules could lead to some cancellation of plans and, in at least some cases, people who lose those plans might be upset about it. this was memorably a major source of controversy during the first year of the affordable care act's implementation, when cancellation notices showed up in mailboxes and people who thought they'd get to keep their old plans couldn't.

the law plainly succeeded on the first two counts, but has had mixed success on the third. subsidies cut off for people earning four times the federal poverty level ― which is $48,000 a year for a single person ― leaving families who aren't wealthy to pay the full premium for their health insurance. that burden increased this year when rates increased much more than during the first three years of obamacare enrollment.
although the decision on the mandate got the most attention at the time, the ruling also affected the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid, under which all states were supposed to open up the program so that it would be available to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line.
if the local garbage man was seen going into a mosque, you could submit that information to the site and she would post it, said galasso.
mulvaney, a hard-line fiscal conservative, quickly developed strong support there, cruising to re-election in 2016 by a margin of more than 20 percentage points. likewise, president donald trump defeated former secretary of state hillary clinton by 18.5 points in the district in november, according to official data collected by daily kos.
in the discussion of the public option, biden made a false statement of his own: he said that nobody would lose their private coverage under his plan, just like nobody had lost their plans under obamacare, except when they wanted to switch coverage.
i'm happy to support any provision that strengthens the aca and plug some of the gaps that we're seeing, particularly as it's under assault by the president, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told huffpost on wednesday. i think it's part of a longer-term vision, at least for me, towards guaranteeing ― truly guaranteeing ― health care for all americans.
the third branch may be one of the few institutions of our democratic republic that is not experiencing a collapse in public trust, romney said, referring to the judiciary system including the supreme court.
it's so wrong what they're doing, pfeifer said of garland, although his own views tilt conservative. you could vote him down, you could do whatever you want to do, but how do you not vote? that's another crime that's going on in this country. it's wrong.
but the chances that the house democratic measures will become law in the short term are slim. republicans retain control of the senate, where majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has steadfastly resisted any attempts to bolster the existing insurance marketplace. and trump has adopted a hostile posture toward the law at every turn. his latest budget proposal maintains the white house's position against the affordable care act.
it was only days ago that trump affirmed that he continues to support a lawsuit pending at the supreme court that would eliminate the affordable care act. what we want to do is terminate it, he said on march 22. (the republican state attorneys general who originated the lawsuit also aren't backing down.)

we can replace lawmakers like mitch mcconnell, susan collins, and steve king, read an email sent out wednesday morning by the group emily's list, which works to elect democratic women who support abortion rights.
the flaws in the argument are not difficult to spot, even for somebody with no legal training. it's quite a stretch to say that the mandate is now an unconstitutional command to get insurance when the consequence for defying it is literally nothing ― and when there is no mechanism of enforcement because there is no fine to collect.
perhaps collins, who seems to have lived in that cocoon in which senators who've been in office for decades often find themselves, is suddenly realizing that we're in a different time and that she's sealed her fate. who knows what trump may have promised collins or what she's afraid he might do to her if she were now to go back on any assurances she may have given on kavanaugh. perhaps collins is worried about a primary challenge from the right in 2020. i would be.
the idea of a public health insurance plan competing with private insurers is hardly moderate by historical standards, but it is now the emerging moderate alternative to medicare for all, larry levitt, executive vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, told huffpost.
barrett, a summa cum laude graduate of notre dame law school, is highly regarded for her intellect ― which suggests, at the very least, she can spot a weak argument when it's in front of her.
president nixon attempted to corrupt elections. his agents broke into the democratic party headquarters to get a leg up on the election and then, just like president trump, he tried to cover it up. then he resigned, california democratic rep. zoe lofgren, who worked on the articles of impeachment against nixon as a 26-year-old law student, said in wednesday's floor debate. this is even worse. president trump not only abused his power to help his reelection, he used a foreign government to do it. he used military aid provided to fight the russians as leverage solely to benefit his own political campaign.
o'connor, who was also nominated by george w. bush, said that because obamacare called the mandate essential, the entire law must be struck down.
nixon saw his approval rating drop to 24% after the supreme court ordered the release of audio tapes proving his role in the watergate cover-up. trump, even after the release of a july 25 rough transcript and supporting testimony showing he had coerced ukraine to hurt his most feared democratic rival, still has approval ratings in the low 40s.

instead, she describes these new requirements as one of the bill's strengths. she points out that the new requirements would call for benefits that both public and private insurance frequently leave out today, including dental, vision and long-term care.
i'm concerned that people will buy these policies, show up at the hospital for a condition they did not expect, and discover they are not covered, lori wing-heier, director of alaska's insurance division, told huffpost. she added that her office intended to look very, very closely at applications from insurers seeking to market these plans.
all of this assumes that rand's projections are basically on target ― and that the new york plan is a reasonable proxy for how medicare for all might work out in the nation as a whole. but projections can be wrong and new york, like any state, has plenty of idiosyncrasies that make extrapolating from it difficult.

for example, in earlier kaiser family foundation polls, 65% of democrats, republicans and independents combined said they favor a public option. that support rose to 75% when respondents were told the program could save money, but fell to 53% when respondents were told the public option would reduce how much doctors and hospitals are paid.
it's a very awkward process, at best, corker said. there are no experts. there's no actuarials. … typically, in a hearing, you'd have people coming in, and you'd also have the media opining about if a hearing took place and x came in and made comments.

during a back-and-forth in the courtroom about women whose employers don't cover contraception, and the subsequent lengths they must go to get it, roberts suggested that it's not actually a big deal if women in such situations have to get their birth control covered some other way. justices anthony kennedy and samuel alito appeared to share the same belief.

health care may or may not be a determining factor in which of these candidates walks away with the democratic nomination. also unknown is whether democratic voters' uneven support for medicare for all will benefit the more moderate candidates, or whether the progressive message of universal health care and better coverage will appeal to primary voters.
i've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let obamacare explode. it's exploding right now. – president donald trump
trump himself campaigned on repealing obamacare, though he has held a variety of positions on the issue. after the election, he said he favored keeping a core part of the law ― the guarantee of coverage options for the millions of people with pre-existing health conditions who would otherwise be frozen out of the insurance market.
asked if he was optimistic that the gop's add-ons would be removed, and would not show up in the government funding bill, reid said he was.
so it's safe to say we'd all gone a little comey crazy.
the braun-donnelly battle is playing out against the backdrop of one of the only populist things trump has ever done.
indeed, the hyde amendment, passed in 1976 by congress, prohibits the use of public funds to pay for abortions, so there is no taxpayer-funded paying of abortion.

instead, buttigieg has said, he would prefer to create a government insurance program that would be open to everybody but also optional for everybody. he calls this approach medicare for all who want it, and the new campaign proposal, which his advisers distributed to reporters prior to its release, explains the basic logic.
during a campaign event promotion for his hotels at the trump national doral miami resort tuesday, the gop nominee seized on the news that health insurance premiums on the affordable care act's exchange marketplaces are going up by a lot for some people next year.

one particularly important blow was the defunding of a risk corridor program designed to insulate insurers from major losses. that led to the shuttering of some smaller insurer plans while forcing bigger ones to raise premiums, to the point where many people who qualified for little or no subsidy stopped buying plans.
michael linden, a fellow at the roosevelt institute, a liberal think tank in washington, d.c., said the trump tax law is certainly not good for communities of color, but it's not good for anybody if there are these special barriers or disproportionate blockades to opportunity and improvement and dignity. it's unacceptable in a modern society, he said, for us to have different economic systems for different people.

gop officials at the federal and state levels have proposed and undertaken a variety of new policies they say will make health insurance more affordable. during the seven-plus years between president barack obama's signing of the health care reform law in 2010 and the collapse of the repeal attempt last year, president donald trump and congressional republicans also promised over and over that they would repeal and replace the federal law with something better.
the latest effort is unfolding in kansas, where gop leaders propose to bring back the kinds of insurance policies that the affordable care act sought to eliminate ― policies that frequently had much lower premiums, but only because they excluded key benefits or weren't available to people with serious medical problems.
republicans didn't have time for the normal legislative process — democrats say it was hard to call it a process at all. the house ways and means committee held only four hearings — two in may and two in july. but because the bill had not yet been drafted, the hearings were limited to the broadest subjects. how tax reform will grow our economy and create jobs was one. how tax reform will simplify our broken tax code was another.
after the evening votes, freedom caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) met with rep. charlie dent (r-pa.), the co-chairman of the moderate gop tuesday group, who said this week that he has reservations about voting for a repeal. according to meadows, he and dent discussed how many moderates might vote against the resolution to set up a fast-track for an obamacare repeal.
meanwhile, the country's manufacturing capacity ― which determines how many manufacturing jobs the country can sustain ― continued to decline. the united states lost 1,800 factories in 2017 and 2018, according to data compiled by the economic policy institute, a progressive think tank that receives some funding from labor unions. (epi's hawkish stances on trade and support for manufacturing policy has given its work bipartisan appeal: trump cited the organization in his march 2016 op-ed.)
he has said the order, which he first announced during a press conference at his new jersey golf club last weekend, would protect people with pre-existing conditions. but the affordable care act already prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on a person's medical status. an executive order wouldn't strengthen that commitment.
she also warned about democratic outside groups ― funded, she claimed, by billionaires george soros and tom steyer ― who are attacking her ahead of the primary. red and gold, a democratic group which has yet to disclose its donors, has spent millions lambasting her for supporting an age tax as part of the gop's failed congressional attempts to replace obamacare.

new orleans (ap) — taking a harder line on health care, the trump administration joined a coalition of republican-led states wednesday in asking a federal appeals court to entirely overturn former president barack obama's signature health care law — a decision that could leave millions uninsured.
biden's speech, which clocked in at a short 24 minutes, was the culmination of this effort. biden weaved his own story about coming back from personal tragedy with his plans to help america come back from the medical and economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, along with a few signature biden flourishes, like a quote from the irish poet seamus heaney.
during his speech, trump did allow a few moments to touch on some of the messages that his new overseers -- the so-called adults in the room -- want desperately for him to emphasize, decrying the loss of manufacturing jobs and promising to repeal obamacare.
he played to his base, gergen added. he treated his other listeners — the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or oppose him — he treated them basically as, 'i don't care, i don't give a damn what you think because you're, frankly, the enemy.'
in public appearances and interviews with media outlets, including huffpost, gop leaders have repeatedly blamed this situation on the design of affordable care act, with reynolds calling it unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.
another thing that people are frankly a little bit suspicious about is your own startup investment fund and this idea that a solution to the health care problems facing low-income people is a for-profit investment fund.

the irs announcement earlier this year made insurers nervous, but a strong signal now from the administration that it will make people comply with the law could alleviate that. it's insurer perceptions that matter here. if they're not confident that this market is going to work, then they're going to run for the exits or raise premiums, levitt said.
in addition to reviving the counterproductive war on drugs, and his cancellation of an obama order to phase out federal use of the often-horrible private prison industry (which donated big to trump), sessions has banned government lawyers from reaching agreements that take some of the funds disgorged from corporate defendants in civil and criminal settlements and give it to non-profit groups. this practice takes cash ponied up by manufacturers, polluters, or banks caught engaging in fraud or other misconduct and provides it to groups that work to protect the public by fighting against such misconduct, helping victims, or crafting policy solutions. big corporate donors don't like this constructive approach, so sessions just got rid of it.

at least nine states that run their own health insurance exchanges have already reopened obamacare enrollment to uninsured residents so they can obtain coverage.
starting next year, every income group will see their average tax rates drop. but rates for the super wealthy, those earning more than $200,000 a year, will decrease between 2.1 and 3.1 percent of their income, compared to half a percent for those earning less than $30,000, according to the joint committee on taxation, a nonpartisan congressional panel that analyzes the effect of proposed tax changes in bills.
perhaps it's not surprising that trump's hostility toward the affordable care act ― arguably obama's most impactful domestic policy initiative ― wouldn't abate, even during a global public health emergency.
in fact, comey's account to the senate intelligence committee ― including that trump got him alone and said i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting flynn go. he is a good guy. i hope you can let this go ― was entirely consistent with the account that comey had leaked to the media prior to his testimony; comey did not admit that trump was right. but you already knew that. comey's account, backed by trump's own admissions regarding his motivations, solidifies a powerful case of obstruction of justice against trump, a matter currently being probed by special counsel robert mueller.

we're seeing here the consequences of a very complex insurance system and the fact that now, people who need the care have a chance to find the care, said donald berwick, a physician who founded the massachusetts-based institute for healthcare improvement who now serves as president emeritus and senior adviser.
the actual effect of these budget caps, however, would be to limit benefits and reduce access to medicaid because states wouldn't have enough federal funding to continue their current programs.
q: i'm getting the impression the details are really important. why haven't the candidates been more specific?
on saturday, trump also directed his twitter followers to tune into a fox news segment in which his friend judge jeanine pirro faulted ryan for the bill's demise and called for his resignation.
the u.s. is also one of the only wealthy, industrialized nations that does not have universal health care. american health care prices are at least two to three times what they are in other countries, and nearly two-thirds of all bankruptcies in the u.s. are due to illness and medical bills.
but democrats scaled back the assistance to reduce the overall price of the bill, in an effort to appease more conservative lawmakers as well as more conservative voters ― and to follow through on a pledge, which democrats had made, that the law would pay for itself.
a similar proposal that the state legislature considered last year would have cost an estimated $250 million per year, according to the los angeles times, and it would all have to come from california because federal dollars cannot be spent on health care programs for undocumented immigrants under the affordable care act and other laws.
these questions are, of course, broad hypotheticals ― public opinion could shake out very differently in the event of a new schism between the president and his party's congressional delegation. the results suggest, however, that most republicans' sympathies lie with trump.

last week, he signed a meaningless executive order declaring it to be the policy of the united states ... to ensure that americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice, which is curious because the aca is the policy of the united states on this matter already.
but employer coverage is still popular, at least according to industry polling. as the 2017 fight to repeal obamacare and pretty much every other health care battle has shown, change of any sort is scary. americans are unlikely to welcome it unless they are absolutely convinced it's a change for the better.
· what's more, starving medicaid would force states to cut payments to doctors and hospitals, sending private health plan premiums higher and putting strains on the provider community.
what he didn't acknowledge is that the republican replacement plans would call for even larger deductibles and that they would make insurance cheaper for some people (the young and healthy) by making it more expensive for everyone else and potentially unattainable for people with pre-existing conditions.
but the path to consensus has been fraught, with gop leadership unable to determine how long precisely to delay the replacement (periods as long as four years have been floated) and with a faction of gop lawmakers vocally opposed to any delay at all. additionally, one of the more interesting things about the repeal-and-delay plan is that the effort that would need to be undertaken to prevent a calamity of bad publicity would inadvertently do the job of shoring up the existing law at some of its weakest points. and that would sure be ironic, as chait points out:
barrett has openly criticized the supreme court's ruling upholding obamacare, which greatly expanded access to birth control and health care more generally and unquestionably helps poor women. she opposes abortion, which studies have shown is critical to the economic empowerment of women.
what the michigan-based and medicaid insurers have in common, udow-phillips said, is that both have a lot of experience constructing networks of physicians and hospitals that will keep costs down. she noted that michigan generally hasn't had the sort of network problems seen in other states ― where patients sometimes get hospital care and discover they have surprise bills because out-of-network doctors were part of their medical teams.
insurers are entitled to the money under a provision of the obamacare health law that promised the companies a financial cushion for losses they might incur by selling coverage to people in the marketplaces created by the health care law, the justices said by an 8-1 vote.
he sees an opening, suggesting that his race could be the next big progressive upset. internal campaign numbers show him within striking distance — seven percentage points — of ousting lynch, a nearly 20-year veteran of the house of representatives and one of joe biden's biggest supporters.
kaiser also asked respondents about some other democratic ideas that call for creating or expanding government-run insurance but without making it a system for everybody. these ideas include some relatively moderate steps, like opening up medicare to people 55 and over ― or offering medicaid to anybody without access to employer coverage.
but the republican white house adviser said the democrats are giving trump too much credit. he said that obamagate has more to do with acting dni richard grenell's willingness to wreak some havoc before his permanent replacement is confirmed by the senate, as well as trump's willingness to say anything, regardless of whether it's true or not.
between 2013 and 2016, the share of kentucky's residents without insurance fell from 20.4 percent to 7.8 percent. that was the single biggest drop of any state in the country.
and none of the policy outlines republicans have promoted would dedicate the level of funding required to maintain what the affordable care act already does, let alone make insurance cheaper and available to more people.
the distinction is not really about substance. the plans would still collect payments from subscribers, pay medical bills and set up doctor networks, just like traditional insurance plans do. but with the special status under the proposed law, the farm bureau's plans would be exempt from the affordable care act's regulations ― which would mean, for starters, no guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
three newcomer women are challenging massachusetts democratic incumbents. tahirah amatul-wadud, an african-american muslim lawyer, is hoping to take rep. richard neal's seat in the 1st district. amatul-wadud has portrayed neal as someone who works for national donors instead of his constituents. like ocasio-cortez, she has rejected corporate campaign money. neal, first elected in 1988, is the highest-ranking democrat on the house ways and means committee and has largely focused on economic policy.
the trump administration has loosened limits on those plans so that people can hold on to them for as long as three years ― making them a more plausible alternative to traditional insurance but posing the same dangers as other plans without guaranteed benefits. actuaries have warned that, by making these policies more available, the administration could also make insurance markets more unstable.

in congress, the party resolved to deny obama reelection by grinding the legislative process to a halt, then blaming him for gridlock as if its tactics played no role. political polarization polluted foreign-policy -- as when all 300 republicans in congress turned the iran deal into a political wedge issue, shunning the careful consideration it deserved in favor of shrill and simpleminded denunciations. in the world of the gop, our many and complex problems had but one misbegotten cause: that barack obama was president.
it was just the opposite as biden opened his michigan swing at a suburban detroit community center. in keeping with his usual protocols, biden and all the participants wore masks throughout the event, except when they were speaking, and a small crowd of dozens of reporters and supporters watched from folding chairs separated by circles to ensure social distancing.
a surveymonkey poll shows similar reactions, with most americans opposed to the republican bill, 55 percent to 42 percent. the poll finds more intense opposition than support, with just 18 percent saying they strongly support the bill, while 38 percent say that they're strongly opposed to it. the democratic firm public policy polling, meanwhile, puts opposition at 49 percent, with just 24 percent approving.
consider what it would mean for a hypothetical real estate agent. today, he or she can get an ahp, but it probably doesn't look much different than the policies available at healthcare.gov or from insurers directly. if the new regulation goes through, that agent could find an ahp with fewer benefits. it'd probably be cheaper, maybe significantly so, because it wasn't designed to cover as many medical bills ― and because sicker people would be unlikely to buy it in the first place.

i sat on that stage between bernie and john mccain, and john mccain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation, klobuchar said. he understood it. he knew because he knew this man more than any of us did.
in the post-roe world, that is where we will see the biggest difference, says perritt. no one should face arrest or jail for seeking medical help, but i think they will.
for all of the talk about how a kinder, gentler trump found his presidential footing in the new york primary by way a staff shakeup that professionalized his seat-of-the-pants campaign operation and public bearing, the vibe among the people who attended his latest rally was as volatile and abrasive as ever. and so was the candidate.
nor did president trump, putative tribune of the little guy, raise objections that the health care package going forward would hurt the little guy while further enriching the rich guy (whoops!). but by now we know trump doesn't always read the documents being passed before him.
he claimed nato member spending has increased for the first time in about 20 years. spending, in fact, rose in 2015 and in 2016, before he took office.
the u.s. would join russia among the excluded nations should the eu finalize the decision, the new york times first reported friday. travelers from more than a dozen other countries that have successfully slowed the spread of the virus would be allowed into the eu.
but the gop's reverence for promises turns out to be curiously selective in this case, because republicans also promised to replace the aca. and they didn't have just any old replacement in mind.
it remains the case that tillerson could be working with the career state department staff to make a positive difference in all kinds of ways; trump likely wouldn't even notice. instead, tillerson calls values like human rights obstacles to u.s. interests, held a press briefing on a saudi arabia trip without inviting the u.s. media, and appears to have ignored his commitment to recuse from matters related to the company he used to run, exxonmobil. but fundamentally, tillerson is just a large gaping hole where a secretary of state is supposed to be: to many state department employees, mr. tillerson is something of a phantom who says little in staff meetings, rarely leaves his seventh-floor office — where he is surrounded by ... a small group of protective aides — and does not solicit their views.
on monday evening, it was martha mcsally's turn. mcsally, gop nominee for arizona's open senate seat, currently serves in the house. last year, she voted for her party's bill to repeal the affordable care act, including regulations that block insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions.
a nine year tracking study of 12 major health care markets found four barriers to efficiency of markets: (1) providers' market power; (2) absence of potentially efficient provider systems; (3) employers' inability to push the system toward efficiency and quality; and (4) insufficient competition among health plans. (3)
the white house and department of health and human services so far have sent mixed messages to the industry and consumers about what to expect.
at the tuesday press conference, inslee said the plan would be available in all parts of the state, in part to fulfill one of its chief goals: to make sure everybody has coverage available. washington, like many states, has had trouble keeping insurers from abandoning rural areas. this year, 14 counties in the state have only one carrier.
washington (ap) — healthcare.gov's market for subsidized health plans reopened monday for a special three-month sign-up window as the democratic-led congress pushes a boost in financial help that could cut premiums by double digits.
democrats need to flip at least three seats to retake control of the senate, and maine is one of their top targets. money is already pouring into the race, with democrats determined to defeat her, and republicans rewarding her for her vote for kavanaugh.
regardless of whether democrats pursue a russia-related line of questioning or stick to obstruction of justice, they will certainly press mueller on whether he would have charged trump with a crime if he wasn't president.
enjeti blames ryan, a wisconsin republican who served as house speaker for the first two years of the trump presidency, and senate republican leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) for hijacking trump's domestic agenda.
republican senators spent much of their time tuesday dodging questions about the specifics of the house republican bill, saying they needed more time to read it.
in an emergency, hhs and the defense department can activate a national disaster medical system to respond to requests from states to pay for some hospital costs. still, congress would likely end up playing a role. even though the disaster medical system was activated in response to hurricane katrina in 2005 and the haiti earthquake in 2010, congress wound up appropriating extra funds to reimburse hospitals.

i love my brother michael and there is no daylight on issues between him and me, greg pence said in a recent email to the indianapolis star.
trump has repeatedly tried to take away the affordable care act's guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions. most recently, he ordered the justice department to endorse a lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality ― a lawsuit whose outcome is a lot more uncertain now that trump has nominated arch-conservative amy coney barrett to succeed justice ruth bader ginsburg on the supreme court.
the trump administration on thursday officially threw its support behind a new, seemingly far-fetched legal challenge to the affordable care act, arguing that the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional.
cnn anchor chris cuomo said tuesday morning that newly leaked audio of house speaker paul ryan could damage congressional republicans' ability to pass a health care bill more than anything that's happened thus far.
the majority-democrat house of representatives and democratic state attorneys general, who are defending the law against a group of republican state officials and president donald trump's justice department, asked the high court to expedite the case, known as texas v. united states. on tuesday, the supreme court said it would not take up the case in its next session, all but erasing the possibility of an election-season ruling that would cause an estimated 20 million people to lose their health coverage.

the party of public safety supports a rhetorical pipe bomber who legitimizes hatred with incendiary accusations, threatens and demonizes political opponents, ignites unreasoning anger against journalists and endangers innocent americans by praising acts of violence. the party of personal responsibility countenances and reinforces a village bigot who nourishes anti-semitism by repeating false accusations against prominent jews.
and malinowski, while acknowledging that a lot of this could be in the weeds for voters, suggested there are ways to campaign on the topic that make it more understandable.
none of these spending efforts are legislative landmarks. the university of louisville has a shrine to mcconnell at its library. the so-called mitch mcconnell center for political leadership is full of photos of him with other famous people. it has a replica of the desk used by 19th century lawmaker sen. henry clay and a placard stating how much mcconnell reveres the great compromiser from kentucky. but there is no interstate highway system, no gi bill, no medicare, no dodd-frank financial regulatory reform bill to congratulate mcconnell on.
he praised a 1952 decision by the court to rule against then-president harry truman for seizing steel mills and emphasized the importance of resisting public pressure.
(the end citizens united poll found swing voters were more likely to agree with democratic arguments when they mentioned mcconnell and the corrupting influence of money on politics.)
what biden said, and didn't say, about medicare for all
republicans in some key races around the country have come up with a new strategy for defending their voting records on health care. they are telling true stories about their family members and untrue stories about gop legislation.
tweets like friday morning's one won't exactly dispel those feelings.
at issue is not what health-insurance system is optimal, but 'only whether congress has the power under the constitution' to command the people as the aca does, the states wrote in their brief.
they could choose a different path for the coming enrollment campaign and work to sign up more customers, especially younger, healthier ones, which would strengthen the market for everybody, levitt said.
obama had become president of these united states. i cannot stress enough the massive psychological effect obama's presidential victory had on this country. for whites, it was an opportunity to say they had participated in the impossible, getting this black, this biracial, this multicultural man, into the white house, that it proved there were white americans who did view the others, at least others like obama, as equal.
right now, some california parents have access to a combined four months of leave at partial pay. those who get less include adoptive parents, same-sex couples and single parents.
why medications are so expensive in the u.s.
it's not an option for everybody, but it's an option for a lot of people susan wagle, the republican senate president, said during the floor debate. (like sen. olson, she declined to respond to questions from huffpost.) supporters of the legislation also like to point out that, in tennessee, the farm bureau reports denying only 15 percent of applicants.
but there are exciting things going on in washington state. there are exciting things going on in new mexico.
but those tax credits aren't available for people in households where income is more than four times the poverty line, which works out to roughly $49,000 a year for an individual and $100,000 for a family of four. and without financial help, premiums can be prohibitively expensive for some people ― especially in rural areas, where a paucity of doctors and hospitals make it difficult for insurers to bargain down prices.

at the same time, older people and those with lower incomes would be getting less financial assistance with premiums, and in some cases out-of-pocket costs, because of how the republican proposal would redirect financial assistance from the federal government. some of these people would buy skimpier plans, with greater out-of-pocket charges, because those would be the only premiums they could afford. others would drop insurance altogether, with no protection from medical bills whatsoever.
among the mourners at that memorial service was activist nicole smith-holt, from nearby minneapolis, whose 26-year-old son, alec raeshawn smith, had died under similar circumstances in 2017.
the 62-year-old says he is an air force veteran who has served in operations desert storm, iraqi freedom and enduring freedom, and he has toured in saudi arabia, turkey and qatar. he said biden would make an excellent commander in chief because he listens and takes advice. of course, it doesn't hurt that he has already served in the white house as former president barack obama's vp. if stevenson had it his way, he'd choose former georgia state rep. stacey abrams as biden's running mate.
what health care used to look like
the trump administration plans to take the healthcare.gov website offline for hours at a time for maintenance during the coming obamacare enrollment season, the hill reported on tuesday.

maybe the best proof comes from the hospitals facing cost pressure today ― say, because they serve a lot of low-income patients who are either on low-paying government insurance plans or have no insurance it all, or because they are run by investor-owned companies that demand profits.
as usual, pre-existing conditions are the core issue
most republicans haven't given up on repeal, or the rest of ryan's agenda for that matter. if republicans continue to hold governing majorities in congress, they will have yet another opportunity to enact at least some of his proposals, carrying on ryan's crusade while he cheers on from the sidelines.
for instance, willmann said his hospital's uncompensated tab last year was about $4.2 million, or 11 to 12 percent of his overall budget.
this is well beyond the level of vitriol that is needed in the primary. more importantly, it's stupid. the democratic party has been advocating for a single-payer health care system since the truman era. hillary clinton herself said in 1994 that a single-payer system was all-but politically inevitable, and advocated making medicare available to all americans in 2008. politicians don't win races by trying to pull the wool over their potential supporters' eyes about core policy beliefs they have held for decades.
barrett's mentor was antonin scalia, a supreme court justice who consistently ruled against gender equality. as an academic, barrett is not known for writing or studying feminist issues. she is known for being pro-life.
sanders did these things because he understood that obamacare was an important step toward the goal he and most democrats have always shared: guaranteeing access to health care for every american. and it's why sanders is now making the case for his medicare for all legislation. he thinks it's the quickest, surest way to reach that objective.
it was klobuchar who articulated the political argument that replacing the entire current coverage system with a wholly public one would be disruptive. i am just simply concerned about kicking half of america off of their health insurance in four years, which is what this bill says, she said wednesday.
missouri has a recent history of adopting liberal policy positions through referendums only to then defeat the democratic candidates who support those ideas at the ballot box. in 2018, voters overturned the state's right-to-work law by a two-thirds margin in august, then ousted democratic sen. claire mccaskill in november.
the moment highlighted trump's efforts to repeal the aca. the president has pledged for years to do so, even after congress — then controlled by republicans in both chambers — failed to pass replacement legislation in 2017.
but i also think it's true that being the first of something isn't always a good thing.
you could say the same about the green new deal. while democratic lawmakers made a big show of their green new deal rollout on thursday, the legislation at this point is just a nonbinding resolution with principles for future legislation. it's a plan to come up with a plan ― and it may never get a vote either.
a lot of money is at stake
and unlike the leading medicare for all proposals, including not just the sanders bill but also a house version from rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), the buttigieg plan would leave many policyholders on the hook for premiums and out-of-pocket costs, sometimes hefty ones.
my plan was to sign up for student health insurance at penn. however, as i went over the policy, i noticed caps on coverage for care and prescriptions. i was devastated. because of my preexisting condition, this policy was not an option for me. i needed to survive.
instead, according to both printed accounts and lobbyists who have spoken to huffpost, mcconnell and his allies are working quietly to stitch together a majority coalition, or something close to it, in hopes of bringing a bill directly to the floor for a vote. republicans might keep their word about waiting for an updated cbo score, but, once they have it, they'll likely keep the debate short.
the affordable care act made access better

before obamacare passed, democrats made health care their issue. for example, in the 2008 presidential election, the obama campaign aired one specific ad on health care 24,000 times. but in 2012, when obama was running for re-election, his campaign had just one health care ad.
she focused on the zika bill rider that prevents groups like planned parenthood from helping people access contraception. zika can be sexually transmitted, even if the infected partner shows no symptoms of having the disease.
the problem has always been with the replace part of the equation. for years, the gop effort to produce an alternate plan has been, to be charitable, a fits-and-starts affair. since march 2009, the republican answer to obamacare has been a schrödinger's bill. or as jonathan chait once put it, the republican replacement plans reside in a state of quasi-existence, and any attempt to summon them into existence will cause them to disappear.
they aren't overstating the case. a ruling to invalidate the affordable care act would do more than end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. it would end the provision of federal subsidies for people who buy private insurance on their own, through healthcare.gov or similar markets that several states operate. and without subsidies, those markets would collapse.
you cannot be charged more or denied coverage. i will not reduce [rape] to calling it a pre-existing condition, he told a high school student. my amendment doesn't do that.
if democrats agree with leader pelosi that these benefits to working families are 'crumbs' and would like to repeal the tax cuts, we encourage them to say so loudly and clearly so americans know exactly where they stand, chris bond, a spokesman for house majority whip steve scalise (r-la.), said in an email. scalise's office has been keeping track of corporate bonus announcements.
including trade associations as eligible for ppp loans is in many cases allowing double-dipping in the federal assistance program, said craig holman, a lobbyist for public citizen, which monitors corporate influence in washington.
the problem is that everyone has a different idea about what constitutes terrific. to trump's legislative partners, that means plans with high deductibles and threadbare benefits that mostly offer catastrophic coverage, subsidized by health savings accounts ― unless, of course, you or your employer are able to afford something better.
mcconnell did steal a supreme court seat for republicans by simply refusing to consider any obama nominee ― a creative and risky maneuver. justice neil gorsuch is thoroughly conservative and will influence american law for years to come. but that win was the exception, rather than the general pattern, and presidents receive much more credit for court legacies than senators do.
this brings you to president obama's financial disclosure report; nothing is said about the other contributors.
other candidates, including sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.), have also endorsed the public option approach.
you're someone with an enormous platform, and it seems like there's an opportunity for you to also participate in this moving of the overton window by backing a specific set of policies and maybe ones that are too radical for the current spectrum.
majority leader steny hoyer (d-md.) told democrats on a conference call this week that members would return to washington when cares 2 is ready, referring to the latest bill congress is preparing in response to coronavirus. the problem for some members is that drafting a bill and then bringing members back means leaving them out of the actual lawmaking process.
in many states, premiums have risen substantially in the past few years, as plans have struggled to attract customers in relatively good health. federal tax credits, which the affordable care act also created, insulate low- and many middle-income people from these increases ― allowing them to get comprehensive coverage, regardless of medical status, at low prices.
and they're hoping to pick up one more in delaware this week. even if they don't, republican john marino, making a bid for the seat, appears to have his finger on the new public pulse. theresa kudlick, a district voter, said marino came by her neighbor's house and she was left with the impression he was the democrat in the race. none of his material mentioned what is becoming an inconvenient fact: he's a republican.
jonathan adler, a case western university law professor and frequent critic of the affordable care act, wrote at the volokh conspiracy blog that the attorneys general brief does a particularly good job of explaining why self-described judicial conservatives should object to the decision below.
democrats have tried for years to get republicans to work with us on ways to get more people covered, make health care more affordable, and improve quality of care ― but before that can happen, republicans have to step back from the precipice and drop their reckless, politically motivated repeal efforts, said sen. patty murray (d-wash.), the top democrat on the health, education, labor and pensions committee.
cannon is not just a critic of the affordable care act, he's also been one of its most relentless adversaries. he's testified before state lawmakers, urging them not to implement the law's features and, along with adler, helped to craft the last big lawsuit. at one point, cannon went so far as to establish what he called the anti-universal coverage club.
to wit, the 1986 bill took two years to create, with lawmakers holding dozens and dozens of hearings and taking testimony from thousands of witnesses. the process was a classic reminder, almost like those how a bill becomes law charts in school textbooks, of how congress, with fits, starts and seemingly endless deliberation, inches its way toward final legislation.
but if you talk to republicans, you're bound to find some lawmakers who insist the ahca would have protected the less than healthy. rep. rodney davis (r-ill.) repeatedly ― and spiritedly ― claimed as much. that's the craziest thing. it's english in there, buddy. read it, he told huffpost.
making that easy for them will have a dramatic effect on both the polls and the national conversation, and i'd suggest there are seven things democrats can do to this end:
democrats pointed to her previous criticisms of supreme court rulings upholding obamacare as evidence that she will rule to strike down the law. they also warned that her pro-life background suggested that she will vote to curtail abortion rights and same-sex marriage nationwide.
i think it's almost like the senate race a little bit — i don't think there isn't a whole lot of oxygen between how the two of them would vote on most issues, scott ferson, who spoke on behalf of lynch's campaign, told huffpost.
to compare the two parties at this time in our history is to indulge in false equivalency.
the question of whether medicare for all would be a winner for the middle class has been a big topic in the 2020 presidential campaign and it came up again in tuesday night's democratic debate.
if there were any lingering doubt about that, it vanished a week ago when the cbo issued its official analysis, predicting 14 million newly uninsured americans within a year and 24 million within a decade. republicans have told critics, and perhaps they have told themselves, that the estimate is wrong. but as sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) pointed out at the time, even if the projection is off by a factor of two, that would still mean 12 million people losing coverage.
the latest generation of the kennedy political dynasty from massachusetts is expected to appeal to working- and middle-class voters, who the democrats will likely say have been abandoned by the president, despite trump's campaign pledges.
mcconnell has absorbed the most important political lesson from the gop's house effort ― namely, that the american health care act is wildly unpopular. the more the public knows about it, the less it seems to like it.

but that was just one marker in another week full of trump disgracefulness.
politico, citing sources familiar with the situation, reported that meehan fired schubert in 2016 after schubert made romantic advances to a woman in meehan's office. meehan then expressed his own romantic interests in the same woman, the outlet reported.
both graham and harrison are expected to campaign in south carolina on the final weekend before election day. they'll also participate in a debate on friday that was canceled earlier this month after a spat over graham's refusal to take a coronavirus test. harrison demanded he be tested after being in proximity to other gop senators who tested positive for the disease.
but in the 2018 cycle, the numbers aren't quite as stark. conservatives are still spending more on anti-obamacare ads ― and airing more spots on the issue ― but democrats aren't nearly as far behind as in the past.
the gop senator has also backed, and helped save, planned parenthood over the years. in july 2017, for example, she was one of the key republican votes that killed her party's legislation to repeal obamacare. one of the reasons she opposed it was that it would have defunded planned parenthood.
that was the end of that particular issue until 2017, when trump and the republican congress reduced the penalty to zero as part of a tax bill. the new lawsuit contends that the 2017 change means the mandate, whose language remains part of the statute, is no longer a tax ― and that, as a result, both it and the rest of the law are unconstitutional.
for clients, it's their last chance probably to enroll in health insurance for 2021, hattemer said.
canova, a 56-year-old law professor who was once appointed by sanders to an advisory panel on overhauling the federal reserve system, has endorsed sanders, and vice-versa. but sanders lost to clinton by 37 points in wasserman schulz's district, so it's unclear how much his endorsement will help canova -- except in fundraising. sanders sent out an email calling for contributions for both himself and canova on may 22. according to the canova campaign, sanders' single email raised over $225,000 for him.
but that doesn't mean people don't receive health care. without health insurance, low-income people are less likely to get preventive care, which often results in worsening health conditions that frequently bring them to hospitals where they are guaranteed treatment. under federal law, hospitals must stabilize and treat anyone showing up at the emergency room, regardless of their ability to pay.
over the course of seven hours at the university of nevada, las vegas, candidates from former vice president joe biden to long shot washington gov. jay inslee took questions from public-sector employees about how they would rebuild unions, provide affordable health care to more americans and undo the policies of the trump administration.

a pig farmer confronted sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) at a town hall meeting early tuesday morning to warn that republicans would essentially create a giant death panel if they repealed the affordable care act.
the party has changed somewhat, said paul harstad, a longtime obama pollster. i think the party is looking for someone more aggressive than obama in tactics and approach.
but a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail medicaid. the gop's failed obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when president ronald reagan backed a version of the policy.
on thursday, the subject was a set of new regulations for association health plans, a form of private insurance that allows small employers to band together and buy or sponsor private insurance plans as one group ― in effect, giving them the kind of buying advantages that large employers have.
it takes away all the money from scientists and teachers and human rights workers and meals on wheels and muppets, and gives it to the people who really need it — the defense contractors, the real time host said.
by the same token, some insurers that expected to pay into the risk adjustment system because they had relatively healthy enrollees won't have to make the payment ― for now. but because they might yet have to make the payments later, they will continue to carry the liability on their books, even as they hold onto the cash.
the latter comments have not deterred quist in his efforts to paint gianforte as an unreliable defender of montanans' health care. quist raised $550,000 in the four days following the times report ― part of a more than $5 million haul that has come from over 200,000 individual donors.
his administration has spent a lot of time and energy explaining why family-friendly policies are good for business, and providing a platform for employers to share their own views on the topic, said debra ness, president of the national partnership for women and families.

president trump has kept his 2016 promises to the american people and more, pushing ahead policies that put america first, white house spokesperson sarah matthews said in a statement. no president has accomplished more at this point in his first term than president trump, including delivering on his promises to cut taxes, renegotiate fair trade deals, rebuild our military, unleash american energy like never before, lower drug costs, stand with our allies, build the wall, and confirm more conservative judges — including two supreme court justices and more than 200 judges to our federal courts.
associated press if the affordable care act is struck down entirely, congress will face an impossible task: pass a comprehensive health overhaul to replace it that both speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), above, and president donald trump can agree to. on march 26, 2019, pelosi and energy and commerce committee chair frank pallone (d-n.j.), left, announced legislation to lower health care costs and protect people with pre-existing medical conditions.
we together can send a signal to this country and to the world by not electing a republican ― the republican that is not here tonight, the republican that refused to show up, he told the crowd.
the arizona republican claimed she would always protect people with preexisting conditions despite her record voting against them. she cited a bill she co-sponsored with other vulnerable gop senators designed to give them political cover on the issue ahead of the november election. but experts said the bill included various loopholes that, if enacted into law, would still allow insurers to exclude people with preexisting conditions.
the nomination of kavanaugh has already led to an increase in the popularity of roe, with 71 percent of americans, a record high, now saying they do not want the decision overturned.

it appears the saga gets even more complicated, however. schubert and meehan both may be under investigation for harassment of the same woman, politico reported.
republican efforts to roll back the affordable care act's insurance reforms continued tuesday, when the trump administration proposed regulations that would make it easier for health insurers to sell cheap, short-term policies that leave out key benefits and are available only to people in good health.
i think a pandemic is a distinct issue from the overall health care proposals that have been on the table for a while, johnson said. we have to put politics aside and address the problem.

doral gm david fedder says 95% of employees get healthcare, so very few on obamacare. — eli stokols (@elistokols) october 25, 2016
of course we have to talk about health care, but it's got to be health care that the american people want. the american people don't want a pure repeal of the aca. they want to keep what works, fix what's broken, he said.
ryan, who announced wednesday that he won't seek re-election this fall, mostly hasn't succeeded in this effort. but he has left an indelible impact on the republican party's identity.
whether that means the rest of the law must now come off the books is the question now facing judge o'connor and, maybe someday, the supreme court.
union leaders are confident donnelly's history of opposing free trade deals and outsourcing will keep voters in his camp in 2018. jerome davison, the rapid response coordinator for the united steelworkers district 7, noted that trump won 40 percent of the vote in deep blue northwestern indiana, even as democratic rep. pete visclosky won re-election with 82 percent of the vote.
john feltner is a trump voter who got laid off from rexnord. the 49-year-old has found a new job doing building maintenance at a hospital. he still likes trump and doesn't like that donnelly voted against the republican tax bill. he doesn't like that donnelly seems uncommitted on brett kavanaugh, trump's latest supreme court nominee.
we didn't even discuss votes, said rep. chris collins (r-n.y.), one of the biggest boosters for the repeal and trump's first supporter in congress. this was a plea, one-on-one-on-one, for the entire conference to come together as a team, to look in the mirror, understand we are the governing body.
trump spent the first few months of his presidency urging the republican congress to repeal the affordable care act. in may 2017, after weeks of back-and-forth, the house passed a repeal bill called the american health care act.
a senior campaign official told reporters over the weekend that these tweaks to the sanders plan grew out of discussions harris had with analysts and voters over the last few months, since she first made plain her support for medicare for all, even though it would end employer coverage.
david mcnew via getty images sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) speaks at a dec. 16 rally in rancho mirage, california. sanders's signature issue in the democratic presidential primary has been medicare for all.
gop opposition to medicaid expansion has left millions of low-income people, mostly in the south, without insurance. many of those states are also the ones where newly reformed private insurance markets have struggled because the affordable care act's design puts a lot of discretion in the hands of state officials. where officials are ambivalent about or hostile to the law, as they have been in places like tennessee and iowa, the state markets have tended not to work well.
nor is it a coincidence that the officials saying nice things about the trump administration regulations come from places that have been most hostile to the aca all along ― places like alabama, whose commissioner jim ridling admitted the new policies offer less financial protection but defended them as covering people up to what they can afford.
democrats also argue that if the law is to be repealed and replaced, that's the job of congress and the president under the constitution, not the courts.
but the tax credits in the republican bills are different from the affordable care act's. instead of adjusting the value to account for premiums and income, as the law does today, the republican plans envision tax credits whose value would vary based only on age. in the leaked bill, for instance, 25-year-olds would get $2,000 a year, while 55-year-olds would get $3,500. it wouldn't matter how much these people make, or what insurance costs in their communities.
republicans all over the country are promising voters that they, too, are committed to protecting people with pre-existing conditions, even though nearly all of them have records of voting for efforts to roll back those protections (if they have served in congress) or of filing lawsuits that would achieve the same goal (if they hold office at the state level).
liberal groups, meanwhile, have spent about $3.1 million to support baldwin.
and that's assuming the price cuts would even become law. even modest proposals to reduce what government programs pay providers and suppliers of medical care generate huge opposition from their lobbying groups. the kind that would come with medicare for all would likely provoke an all-out war, one for which industry groups are already preparing.
lori lodes, who served as a communications director of cms during the obama administration, also expressed concern at the large chunks of downtime being scheduled.
the majority of people buying coverage on their own are eligible for tax credits that offset premiums, which get bigger as premiums go higher. in general, they won't have to pay more for coverage, even as it gets more expensive. but people who earn too much to qualify for the tax credits ― anybody with income above four times the poverty line, or $98,400 for a family of four ― would bear the full brunt of those higher premiums.
they should repeal you. — bag of toys (@bagoftoys) june 30, 2017

just to see him and his partner go throughout the united states together, hand in hand, spreading the same message of basically love and peace and unity and honestly that right there puts him at the forefront for me. darius jones, 30 your browser does not support the audio element.
senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) seemed stunned to hear of cornyn's comments.
if that were to happen, 20 million people could lose health coverage, according to projections from the urban institute. far-reaching provisions of the law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, would also come off the books.
the central issue in the case is the affordable care act's individual mandate, which is ― or, more precisely, was ― a financial penalty for people who do not have insurance. the 2017 republican tax cut, passed by congress and signed by trump, left the language of the mandate in place but reduced the penalty to zero.
i mean, if we still have a damn country at that point. seriously, is this a good tradeoff?
mccain likely got the figures from a report by think tank american action forum, which published a study claiming that reducing greenhouse gas emissions would cost $93 trillion.
it's kind of everything and nothing. when you look at salaries of hospital, pharma or insurance ceos, they're really high ― millions, often tens of millions, annually. that's one issue. but what i learned as i was researching this book was that it's everything that contributes to the cost, and the money goes everywhere ― except to patients! it's basically being pulled out of our wallets.
remember that time president obama made sure people could get insurance even if they had a bum knee or survived cancer? yuck yuck! https://t.co/yio6sitc0a — jennifer hayden (@scout_finch) february 15, 2019
among the casualties was the agenda most dear to the republican establishment. its insensitivity to the base has eroded support for free trade. despite its claims of fiscal probity, the gop continued its meretricious complaints about deficit spending -- for which, as ever, it blamed the democrats' self-serving rhetoric about protecting social security and medicare -- while proposing tax cuts for the wealthy that would explode the national debt. and consider this: how do tax cuts at the top benefit the struggling middle and working classes? and wouldn't slashing or privatizing social security further threaten their fragile place in our society?
washington ― for the 31 house democrats representing districts that president donald trump won in 2016, issues like impeachment and his latest unhinged tweet probably aren't making it into the campaign stump speech.
and for the third time since 2012, millions of americans wait, terrified, to find out whether they will lose their health coverage. an estimated 21 million people could find themselves uninsured if the supreme court rules to eradicate the law, according to the urban institute, a new york-based research organization.
it's also possible trump's endorsement didn't turn the tide in these contests. most of the defeated candidates are the type of establishment politicians republican voters have been tossing aside since the tea party movement began in 2010. in the secretly audiotaped words of cagle, the georgia primary came down to who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who could be the craziest.
when he was released the first time in 2008, he couldn't vote because he wasn't able to obtain the required photo id that south carolina citizens need. according to state law, those convicted of a felony are ineligible to vote while in prison, on parole or on probation; their voting rights are restored only upon completion of their sentence. they do, however, need to re-register to vote. he's already tried to register before the deadline, which is 30 days before election day in south carolina, but didn't make it because he wasn't aware of the cutoff. election workers turned him away, saying he didn't have proper documentation.
the court often operates like a uva billing office. uva sends collections representatives, not lawyers, who sit near the judge's bench. they give patients two weeks to commit to an interest-free payment plan, according to courtroom meetings witnessed by a reporter. otherwise, we're already going to be reviewing it for garnishment, a uva official tells a car accident victim. with bills often in the tens of thousands of dollars, even the five-year, interest-free plans are unaffordable, patients said.
while the trump administration fights to strip access to healthcare, our coalition moves forward to defend it — because a pre-existing medical condition should never again disqualify you from receiving affordable healthcare, becerra said.

the real choices that voters face in november
carol cure had been an active member of the democratic party more than two decades ago in arizona ― even running unsuccessfully for congress ― but she thought those days were behind her. she's now back in the game.
the pac's new endorsees include m.j. hegar, an afghanistan war veteran and women's rights pioneer running in texas' 31st; abigail spanberger, a former cia officer running in virginia's 7th; and aftab pureval, the hamilton county clerk of courts running in ohio's 1st.
as envisioned by the aca when it passed congress in 2010, expansion states would extend benefits to all adults — including childless adults — whose income was at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. (in 2019, that would be an average individual income of $12,140, depending on the state.)
unwinding those changes ― going back to a time when healthy people could get less expensive, less generous policies, even if it raises premiums for more comprehensive coverage ― has been the common thread in pretty much every gop health policy effort of the last year, including proposals to repeal obamacare. and that's very much the goal of the new regulation.
it's also turned off some progressive activists who worked with gross during his days as a medicare for all advocate and member of physicians for a national health plan. a new gross tv ad that shows him declaring his opposition to medicare for all and the green new deal while wielding his rifle in the alaskan wild is a particular sore point.
young kids of color march to the south carolina statehouse from zion baptist church in columbia, south carolina.
one of the reasons that people are concerned that united states of care will at least be constrained in terms of the sorts of options it will be able to promote is because of the presence of people from the private insurance industry who might not have a stake in certain kinds of solutions.
the results of the election would have to look more like 2008, when democrats were able to bring record enthusiasm in liberal strongholds, as well as hold on to traditionally more conservative centers in ohio and indiana, than 2018, where democrats ceded key senate races to republicans despite gaining significant ground in house races.
inslee insisted that is not what's proposed in the green new deal to the cheers of audience members.
most of harrison's eye-popping haul has already been spent on television and radio ads, which have been impossible to miss. based on the sheer amount of political advertising blanketing south carolina's airwaves, one might think it was a battleground state that could help decide the fate of the senate and maybe even the presidential race.
some ended up paying a lot more for coverage they felt was inferior. others sought out alternatives, such as religion-based health sharing plans that may be no more reliable than the skimpy plans the affordable care act eliminated. and some went uninsured.
lyness, who is the chief law enforcement officer for johnson county, didn't realize mekelburg had targeted her until she was contacted by huffpost.
if, however, you're the sort of person who pays attention to the world around you, you have good reason to believe that trump's latest vow to reform the health care system is as bogus and disingenuous as all his others.
the most common industry for worker complaints was retail, which accounted for more than one out of every five investigations. the cases revealed violations by a litany of household names: bestbuy, jcpenney, dollar general, lowes, toys r us, costco and kroger, among others. walmart had the most violations of any private company, with six, but it is also the largest private-sector employer in the u.s., with 1.5 million workers.
ailes died in 2017. in 1968, he was a television talk show producer when he went to work for nixon, but was not able to start any such service before he was pushed out of nixon's campaign in 1971. he did start television news incorporated, a washington-based conservative news service, in 1974, but it went out of business the following year.
the rand analysis of the nyha makes this quite clear. the report's appendix breaks down the effect that the plan would have within specific income groups. within the middle income groups ― those with annual income between 139% and 400% of the poverty line, or about $35,790 to $103,000 for a family of four ― there is always a fraction for whom the nyha taxes are more than they would have spent for health care under the status quo.
the 2010 law, seen as the signature domestic achievement of trump's democratic predecessor, barack obama, has been a flashpoint of american politics since it passed, with republicans including trump repeatedly attempting to overturn it.
my only deal-breaker is lack of ability to communicate. things, unanticipated things, will surface.
with so many experts criticizing the argument, and quite a few mocking it, the chances for success would appear to be slim. still, the 5th circuit is full of conservative republican appointees ― and, at this point, nobody is willing to dismiss the threat of this lawsuit out of hand.
that probably explains why republican candidates around the country are doing precisely what trump has been doing: lying about their records.
most likely that is because they can read polls, like one that the henry j. kaiser family foundation published early wednesday. in that survey, 75 percent of all respondents ― and 58 percent of republicans ― said preserving the affordable care act's protections were very important.
klobuchar, speaking to a crowd of more than 200 at jasper's winery, said she sat next to mccain, one of trump's most outspoken republican critics, and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) during the inaugural address, which became known for its blunt expression of trump's authoritarian populism and invocations of american carnage.
the most urgent problem we'll face in our generation is a lack of infrastructure to deal with the casualties of the shifting economy. we got a taste of this with the collapse of american manufacturing jobs — more of which were automated than outsourced. if trump won on the strength of that first wave, imagine what's coming when their numbers swell by 20 or 30 million more displaced workers?
state and federal democratic leaders want the supreme court to review a controversial, widely derided lower court ruling on the affordable care act that has jeopardized insurance for 20 million americans and has threatened to throw the u.s. health care system into chaos.
while democrats in sun belt states like georgia, florida and arizona have picked young politicians of color — stacey abrams, andrew gillum and david garcia, respectively — as their gubernatorial nominees in hopes of firing up democratic voters who often don't show in midterm election years, democrats across the rust belt have instead selected experienced technocrats, and are pitching themselves to swing voters as the solution to america's political chaos.
president donald trump issued a proclamation friday that immigrants will not be granted future visas leading to resident green cards if they cannot obtain health insurance — and can't afford to cover significant medical costs.
castro has consistently shown his willingness to draw contrasts and critique his opponents ― remember his attacks on o'rourke in the first debate ― and biden was his main target thursday. his attack on the 76-year-old former vice president during the health care portion of the debate ― you just said that. you just said that two minutes ago. you just two minutes ago said that they would have to buy in. ― is unlikely to lead to a detailed policy discussion and has already led to a discussion about whether the attack was unfairly ageist. (castro, in post-debate interviews, insisted he wasn't taking a shot at biden's age.)
franch usually gets about 20 people at her monthly meetings ― 40 on a good day. but at the end of january, she had 120.
americans must not be fooled: republicans have no plan to lower costs and expand health care coverage, only a lawsuit that takes it all away, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said in a statement.
taking big money from major financiers like a bain co-chairman almost certainly has subtle effects on its recipients' political strategy and policymaking.
frelinghuysen's retirement could also set off a race for the top spot on the appropriations committee, the panel that controls how much money the government spends. the two front-runners are reps. robert aderholt (r-ala.) and kay granger (r-texas), though other republicans could also vie for the spot.

expanded use of ahps also create more opportunities for deceptive advertising ― or outright fraud ― surrounding the policies. recent history is littered with cases of people buying ahps, only to discover gaps in benefits they never knew existed. other folks have purchased plans that quickly became insolvent.

here are four takeaways from the third democratic presidential debate:
washington ― at his first post-election press conference on wednesday, president-elect donald trump said he will release his own plan to repeal and replace the affordable care act shortly after taking office. what he didn't say is what that plan will be or how it will work.
he's shown very little interest around serious policy discussion about health care, krein said.
you can't beat trump with double talk on this plan, biden said during the exchange, looking over at harris to his left. harris responded by calling his criticism inaccurate but soon found herself the target of fire from sen. michael bennet (colo.), who urged her to be honest about her proposal.
he also blasted bevin's proposed tax reforms and his claims that kentucky is prospering economically at a time when workers are falling further behind because their wages don't go up. (kentucky's economy is doing well by its standards, but wage and economic growth have lagged behind the national average.) and he painted bevin, a hedge fund manager, as an out-of-touch rich guy: each and every one of his policies suggest that there are two classes of kentuckians, beshear said. him and his rich buddies, and then everyone else.
the american health care act would eliminate the fines associated with the affordable care act's individual mandate, which says most u.s. residents must have health coverage. it would also wind down the extra federal funding for the medicaid expansion in 2020 and scrap the income-based tax credits for private insurance. these credits would be replaced by age-based tax credits that would provide less help to lower-income families and more to people with higher incomes.
for the sixth time since 2012, a catholic social justice group is sending a group of religious sisters across the country on a bus tour ― this time to protest against the gop tax law ahead of the midterm elections. the 27-day, 54-event tour is set to hit 21 states, including a slew of competitive congressional districts. the tour will end with a fiesta for the common good outside of the trump-owned mar-a-lago resort in florida.
separate from the issue of bonuses, the tax law will result in slightly larger paychecks for most workers, since firms are withholding less income tax due to the new law's lower rates.
marilyn tavenner, ceo of america's health insurance plans, praised the aspects of the regulation designed to ease regulatory burdens on insurers and impose stricter requirements on consumers.
trump vowed to eliminate obamacare during his 2016 campaign. but the republicans have yet to come up with an alternative for the millions who depend on the system.

in the 38 states whose residents use the healthcare.gov enrollment system, however, sign-ups are only available to people who experience one of the qualifying life events. that's because president donald trump refused to reopen the exchanges to everyone. the same is true in idaho, the sole state-run exchange not to reopen.
biden's focus on health care was echoed by nearly every major democratic figure. alabama sen. doug jones, the most vulnerable member of congress, said friday that trump was aiming to throw our health care system into even greater turmoil with the nomination. vermont sen. bernie sanders, the most progressive member of the chamber, said republicans now want to ram through a supreme court nominee who will vote to destroy the affordable care act, kick millions off their health care, and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions.
why the court might grab the case ― and why it might not
the big unknown is whether the new regulations are legal. insurance regulation falls under multiple federal laws and it's entirely possible that the attempt to change ahp regulations go beyond what those statutes allow. lawsuits are a near certainty and they could tie up the regulation in courts for months, maybe years.
management's next best solution was to provide her with a manual pump to use in the fitting room. but her body had grown accustomed to the electric pump, and her milk production dropped off sharply when she started using the manual one. the lack of milk left her baby hungry. her colleagues saw her crying at work and pooled money to buy her the baby formula she apparently couldn't afford.
trump and congressional republican leaders are rushing their bill to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with their own version, as they have been promising for years. they aim for floor votes and delivery to trump's desk before lawmakers leave washington for their mid-april recess.
as we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the united states. we have just heard that mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. i have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.
exactly where along that spectrum the harris plan exists depends a bit on your perspective and on some of those details the campaign has yet to provide. but its overall goal is unambiguous. if fully implemented, the harris plan would result in every american having comprehensive health insurance, achieving an objective that democrats have been pursuing for nearly a century, most recently with the affordable care act.
real change is never going to come from capitol hill. it will come from a grassroots political movement. when millions of people stand up and fight back, we will not be denied. bernie sanders at the we the people summit
later corker called the entire saga very difficult at best, adding that there's been a lot of progress in understanding the problems senators have with the house bill, and between each other, but there's no bill written.
spokespersons for the democrats' house and senate campaign committees made clear that republicans will have to defend this decision and that the gop will face serious blowback in the midterms.
parents may be eligible, but in non-expansion states, eligibility is strictly limited and ranges from just 7% of poverty in texas, or $1,520 a year for a family of three, to 95% of poverty in tennessee, or $20,600.

seniors would be thrown out of nursing homes or lose home care services. children and people with disabilities would go without needed care. families would be slammed with crushing health care costs for their parents. huge costs will be shifted to state governments, health care and other jobs will be lost, and the economy will be hurt.
the second trial considered overlaps in the two insurers' business selling health benefits to individuals, and administering medicare advantage coverage to the elderly.
over and over again, obamacare's political opponents, including then-presidential candidate donald trump, cited the company's withdrawals as proof that insurance carriers were losing money and the new state insurance exchanges were falling apart.
i don't think i can guarantee a house outcome but i think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill ― the odds go up in the house, sen. tim kaine (d-va.) told huffpost.
when people get sick, they often decide it's time to hit the road. those who take early retirement because of health problems may be eligible for the social security disability insurance program ― but that's not a slam dunk.
the most highly viewed hours, evening prime time and the early morning, feature shows that almost exclusively lavish trump with praise and attack his critics.
after election day, trump and republican leaders in congress immediately started laying out a plan to repeal the health care reform law president barack obama enacted in 2010 that has reduced the national uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. so far, they have failed to tell the public what they would rather do instead.
with the help of local police, who put up caution tape near a side entrance, coffman left the building minutes before the town hall meeting was scheduled to end.
in order for women to achieve full equality outside of the home, men have to take on their fair share in the home, mar explained, and denying men the opportunity to do this harms both men and women. all of us should have a deep and meaningful home life and work life if we so choose.
the senate bill does protect those with pre-existing conditions, including mental illness, more than the house version. it does this by keeping a provision, known as the community rating, that prevents health insurers from charging those with pre-existing conditions more.
corporate taxes were slashed 40 percent by trump (from 35 percent to 21 percent). the law also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt), which had mandated that companies pay some minimum tax on their income. that left corporations not only paying significantly lower tax rates but also holding amt credits from previous years that they could use for refunds.
then biden began to make the case against medicare for all. it rested largely on trying to scare old people, a tactic republicans frequently use to whip up anxiety about any democratic plan to reform the health care system.
virginia state sen. jennifer mcclellan (d) is jumping into the race for governor, saying the state is at a critical crossroads right now about what direction we're going to go.
and congress is nowhere close to being in a position to advance a new set of health care reforms at the same time it votes to undo the affordable care act because republicans can't agree on the procedural steps, let alone the policy they would put in place. after years of attacking obamacare, the gop has never even reached a consensus about what the goals of health care reform are.
we will not have trumps wall to protect us from the bad guys walking into texas with their guns drawn. the immigration flood into the united states will continue. the estimated rate of 700 thousand illegals per year will continue to roll into the us.
some wall street analysts expect all four of the companies to now move on, although aetna and humana have not committed to doing so. their deal expires feb. 15.
they're on the exchanges, right? roberts said, implying that women without access to contraception from their religious employers can just sign up to receive it through the federal insurance exchanges instead.
as president, obama promoted many of them as ways to make his signature legislative accomplishment work better. as a candidate in 2016, hillary clinton proposed a $250 billion plan that would have helped people struggling with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, much like warren's plan would.
medicaid benefits also can be retroactive up to three months. that means the program can cover medical costs incurred by a person who was eligible but not enrolled ― which is helpful if it takes a newly unemployed person a while to figure all this out.
i'm proud to be fighting for arizona every single day, she said evasively.
conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against baldwin, which is more than what all the other democratic senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to a center for responsive politics report in november.
alternatively, she could agree with the plaintiffs that the mandate is unconstitutional but then say that the rest of the law can stay in place. that would give the law's opponents a rhetorical victory of sorts but without actually changing anything in the health care system.
aaron p. bernstein/getty images sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) led a successful crusade to defund a program that was supposed to insulate insurers from unexpected losses in the early years.
braun, who self-funded his primary victory over gop reps. todd rokita and luke messer with the fortune he made as the president and ceo of meyer distributing, has aggressively defended his company's reputation. the first television ad he released after winning the primary wasn't an attack on donnelly ― instead, it was a glossy spot defending meyer's reputation from democratic attacks, boasting it pays twice the minimum wage and provides health coverage for its employees.
sessions' decision to abandon the government's defense of a federal law is highly unusual. the justice department is responsible for representing the united states in lawsuits and is charged with defending lawful statutes as long as there is any reasonable argument supporting the government's case.
but the gop's best hope of getting a bill through still seems to be this week's revised legislation. while the health care plan continued to appear short on support wednesday, mcconnell still has more than $400 billion in savings he can dole out to win over reluctant republicans. many of murkowski's concerns for alaska could be addressed with that money, as could some concerns of other republicans over the phaseout of the medicaid expansion and high premiums for low-income seniors, though aides and senators have indicated that the new bill will mostly preserve the current provisions on ending the medicaid expansion.

the new requirements on insurers ― to ignore pre-existing conditions, and to sell policies with a full spread of essential benefits like mental health and maternity care ― caused insurers to raise underlying premiums, or in some cases eliminate policies altogether. subsidies offset the higher premiums, but not for everybody. in all likelihood, some of the michiganders cheering on trump this week were a few of the lucky people who had those old policies ― and who remember, bitterly, president barack obama's promise that if you like your plan, you can keep it.
under the proposed regulation, it's possible ― although not certain ― more people could end up in plans that the federal government has primary responsibility for regulating, rather than states. but when it comes to issues like insurance fraud and solvency issues, states have more significantly more experience, knowledge, and resources.
california attorney general xavier becerra is leading the defense along with his counterparts from colorado, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, iowa, kentucky, massachusetts, michigan, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, new york, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, vermont, washington state and the district of columbia. the democratic-led house of representatives joined the defense last february.
when the numbers became too big to ignore, trump promised that the outbreak was under control and would go away soon. it wasn't and didn't. when doctors, nurses and other health care providers were struggling to get protective supplies, trump said the states should take charge ― even though, traditionally, the federal government did that.
not that anybody should be surprised. the legislation would roll back the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid. it would also shift the law's federal tax credits for insurance, so that the young and healthy get more relief, but the old and sick get less.
donald trump vows he'll keep his campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare. of course, neither he, nor mike pence, nor speaker paul medicare coupons ryan, nor majority leader mitch mcconnell have the slightest idea what that replacement will be...and they won't until their big insurance donors tell them what to do. so let's focus on the obvious priority, which is a cool name for the upcoming republican system. here is my humble contribution...
some lawmakers were pushing to hold a vote on the bill itself as soon as possible, regardless of whether too many of their colleagues were publicly opposed. ryan can afford to lose 21 or 22 members, depending on how many lawmakers are present, and still succeed. the huffington post's count has him losing well more than that.
the list of democratic convention speakers this week includes several people who depend on the affordable care act for insurance. one is jeff jeans, an arizona small business owner who became famous in 2017 for confronting then-house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) during a cnn town hall session.
trump has since promised an alternative program that would provide better, cheaper coverage, but republicans have never devised such a plan. in all likelihood, the kind of ruling trump now seeks would require complete dismantling of the affordable care act, down the last statutory clause and last appropriated dollar.
smartboy10/getty images democrats now have unified control of 14 states and the district of columbia.
with the new repeal bill, republicans have constructed legislation that would accomplish many of their most cherished goals, like reducing taxes on the wealthy and reducing the regulation of insurers. and their proposal would surely benefit some people, including some for whom the affordable care act has meant higher premiums and weaker coverage.
and rep. lauren underwood (d-ill.), who took down former rep. randy hultgren (r-ill.) in 2018, essentially refused to say whether she supported medicare for all, insisting that supporting or opposing it wasn't a binary choice.
writing checks to individuals to purchase insurance is, in principle, obamacare. it does allow more choices for individuals, and is more patient-centered, but is fundamentally grounded on the idea that the federal government should fund insurance purchases.
the regulations must go through a formal, 60-day comment period before they become final. during that period, the three departments issuing the regulation ― health and human services, labor, and treasury ― are likely to hear from a variety of experts, advocates, and industry groups wary of the changes.
in both states, the nomination of weak gubernatorial candidates could hurt republican chances of holding the house. there are two competitive seats in kansas, and two rural districts and two suburban districts up for grabs in minnesota.
it's not a problem for the majority of people buying on their own, because they qualify for tax credits. they can get plans for dirt cheap, or sometimes for no cost at all. but other buyers are migrating to alternative means of paying their medical bills ― if not the ministries, then the short-term plans ― that cost less upfront but are not as useful, or simply not available, to people with serious medical problems.
gop leaders mused in the recent past about taking seats from democrats in wisconsin, pennsylvania, ohio and michigan ― all states trump won. but those efforts have largely evaporated. now mcconnell and gop leaders are diverting precious time and money to states where mcconnell sees a knife fight in an alley to retain or take seats: arizona, nevada, tennessee, montana, north dakota, missouri, indiana, west virginia and florida.
a lot would obviously depend on the details ― that is, precisely how low a medicare for all proposal would push prices and, critically, how long it would take for those reductions to take place. there's a vast difference between cutting hospital rates by 10 percent over three to four years and cutting them by the same margin over seven or eight.
cutting regulations? while trump has started the process for rolling back environmental and safety regulations on industries, he has taken credit for slashing hundreds of other regulations that were cut under president barack obama or were blocked from being implemented thanks to legislation the gop congress started preparing before trump even took office.

but ginsburg never considered taking time away from work, de hart wrote: ever the realist, she knew that asking for special consideration could jeopardize her prospects for tenure.
these goals aren't compatible with each other. and with this legislation, house leaders have made it clear they are going to err on the side of less regulation, spending, and taxes ― even if that means people who need help paying their medical bills don't get it.
helping our neighbors get health insurance even though they have a pre-existing condition is something americans support and the administration's action will hurt families in our states, the governors wrote monday in a joint statement.
it's already hard to deal with 'dual identity' being a black man and a gay man, he said, explaining how it feels to juggle both identities consciously. not knowing which [identity] people are responding to and not knowing how your black community will respond with your sexuality.

the kentucky primary was originally scheduled to take place on may 19 but was delayed for more than a month over concerns about covid-19. after kentucky gov. andy beshear (d) and secretary of state michael adams (r) reached a bipartisan agreement to expand absentee voting with no-excuse mail-in ballots and to allow a week of early voting, the election drew record turnout for a kentucky primary. total votes surpassed the number cast in 2008, when hillary clinton and barack obama dueled for the democratic presidential nomination.
one proponent of the six-year-in-the-making argument is mark prater, who was chief tax counsel to the senate finance committee until he left in may 2018 to join professional services firm pricewaterhousecoopers. in a recording of a tax seminar last summer obtained by cpi, prater said his committee had relied on dozens of hearings, lots of reports, lots of joint committee activity, lots of production there over that six years.
trump and his white house, of course, disagree with assessments like unruh's. as he has from nearly the day he took office last january, trump claims that his presidency has accomplished more than any previous one. i don't think any administration has ever done ― has done what we've done and what we've accomplished in its first year, which isn't quite finished yet, he said at a recent cabinet meeting after first telling reporters: welcome back to the studio.

he's embraced the role of dad-in-chief.
in the article, the president asks congress to give the federal government the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced drugs. there is no law that i am aware of that would prevent this negotiation from happening right now. i think what the president really wants is to regulate what pharmaceutical companies can charge. he also wants the congress to keep the independent payment advisory board (ipab) from any type of legislative review. the role of the ipab is to determine what and how much medicare and medicaid will pay for. the last i checked, we have a free market economy where suppliers of a product are allowed to charge what the market will bear. competition in the market place, not the government, is the best way control costs.
the anxiously-awaited cbo report, american health care act, offers a quantitative analysis of the impact of the republican effort to gut the obama administration's signature accomplishment, the affordable care act, and replace it.
the new version, like the last one, notes that the four had fought each other on previous lawsuits over the affordable care act but are united in their belief that texas vs. azar is fundamentally unsound because of how it interprets ― or misinterprets ― congressional intent.
sen. joni ernst (r-iowa) says she doesn't think the supreme court will overturn its landmark 1973 roe v. wade abortion rights ruling, even though she signed a brief urging the court to do so earlier this year.

so, when she wanted to order octopus at our friend's greek restaurant, i said yes even though a moment earlier, i'd said paula, i don't like octopus.
it would be difficult in such a scenario for republicans to overturn the vice president's decisions. they would need to muster 60 votes to reverse him or her.
sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) tried to find out more about the nominee's feelings on executive powers.
frequently, people who bought short-term plans ended up facing crushing medical bills, because agents or insurers hadn't made limits on these plans clear ― or because insurers had found reasons not to cover bills after the fact. in one case that's currently the subject of a lawsuit in federal court, a heart attack victim who had a short-term policy is on the hook for $900,000, according to a story on short-term plans by reed abelson of the new york times.
in particular, buttigieg would guarantee that anybody buying insurance through one of those marketplaces could enroll in the new public option or buy a gold private plan, in which premiums would be no more than 8.5% of a household's adjusted gross annual income. and that is just the maximum amount a consumer would owe. for millions, insurance would cost less, thanks to federal subsidies that already exist but that buttigieg would make more generous.
judge barrett sends a message to christian and pro-life women in america that, yes, there is a seat at the table for you, graham said in a senate floor speech on monday prior to barrett's confirmation.
behind the scenes, these same governors are also working to persuade lawmakers from their states and those who have purview over the repeal and replace strategy that it would be wise to keep some portion of the federal matching funds for states that have pursued medicaid expansion.
politico reporter eli stokols was on the scene in florida. (read his dispatch here.) let's start with this:
the breakdown of tax cuts by race has implications for the upcoming midterm elections and for proposed additional tax cuts republicans say they want to enact this fall. earlier this year, republicans seemed to feel that the cuts in last december's the tax law would increase their chances for victory in this november elections — but that enthusiasm has since waned. so now many republicans want to pass more tax cuts in the coming months, hoping that could further bolster their election prospects. trump said in july that any new tax legislation passed this fall will be more aimed at the middle class.
the minute i took a leave of absence, the insurance company insisted i lost my student status. my medical bills were sent to my parents — while i was in the hospital on the verge of dying.
republicans learned this firsthand after passing their tax cuts. majorities of americans said in polls that their own households would not receive a tax cut, and were more likely to see their taxes go up – even though, in truth, the vast majority of households will see at least a temporary reduction.
none of the proposals under discussion are especially new. most have been around since long before the phrase obamacare was even part of the lexicon.
the likely chaos is an argument against the lawsuit
democratic leaders, including the ranking members on the finance and help committees ― sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) and sen. patty murray (d-wash.) ― have sent letters calling for a more deliberative process. but they lack the power to enforce their will.
it's the day of the spring student organization fair at the university of south carolina. ashley harrington, the event director for the usc college democrats, is headed to her organization's table to encourage students to vote and get involved.
that's key to understanding the intra-party debate about how to approach health care reform.
about the only sure thing seems to be that neither gop leaders nor members want to be dealing with health care forever. they continue to say they would like a vote no later than the august recess, even though the possibility of reaching a deal by then seems highly uncertain.
but he faults trump for effectively letting them do it.
the full repeal of obamacare, root and branch, was of course the core animating principle of the entire republican party for the better part of the decade. they voted for its total repeal, including its protections for pre-existing conditions, regularly as a point of pride.
some believe that if congress had held hearings on the bill, wiser minds could have sounded alarm bells about the debt it would create. the hearings, they say, might have steered the bill more toward helping low- and middle-income families, and minorities. hearing witnesses also might have warned that the increase in the debt threatens social security and medicare, and even national security.
it's interesting that you mentioned marriage equality as a model you want to emulate. chapo trap house, a popular left-wing podcast, spent a lot of time criticizing your group. and they likened the push for 'medicare for all' to the same-sex marriage fight ― that if you continue canvassing and building grassroots support, and educating people on the need to at least treat health care as a human right and, in their opinion, to make it free at the point of service, that, maybe not in two years or in four years but in 10 or 20 years, you'll ultimately achieve your goal. and, in the meantime, you'll move the overton window, or range of politically acceptable views, to the left.
national democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars targeting wisconsin and are lining up their top surrogates to try and provide a jolt to tony evers' campaign and defeat scott walker, said brian reisinger, a spokesman for walker. the problem for evers is all the national democrats flooding our state only further highlight his liabilities with voters — from the tax-and-spend record of jay inslee to the rampant plagiarism of joe biden.
trump has consistently polled behind biden in michigan; two weeks before election day, the democratic ticket has an 8-point lead. trump's campaign has pulled back spending in michigan since early september.

katie keith, a health law professor at georgetown university who has written extensively about the case for the journal health affairs, said she agrees on both counts.
trump formally designated a public health emergency for the crisis in october. the move came two months after his commission recommended he instead declare a full-on national emergency, which would have opened up billions of dollars of funding. the public health emergency fund currently holds only about $57,000, which amounts to 2 cents for each individual in the u.s. struggling with opioid addiction, according to the progressive nonprofit drug policy alliance.
the senate voted tuesday to confirm to the 4th circuit allison jones rushing, 36, who worked for the anti-lgbtq group alliance defending freedom and has argued that there were moral and practical reasons for banning same-sex marriage.
these short-term plans can actually last up to three years (in theory), making them an alluring alternative to people who think plans compliant with affordable care act standards are too expensive. but the short-term plans frequently aren't available to people with preexisting conditions, lack key benefits and have huge out-of-pocket costs. those out-of-pocket costs have, among other problems, made it difficult for coronavirus patients to pay their bills.
sotomayor is correct: there is no such thing as a birth control only policy. the affordable care act simply doesn't allow any type of insurance that isn't comprehensive to be sold on the exchange marketplaces. roberts either didn't know that, or was pretending not to. in most states, even dental plans for adults are only available to those who also are buying full-coverage medical insurance.
thursday's news came just hours after trump addressed fellow republicans in philadelphia, and repeated an argument he and other gop leaders have made many times: that the affordable care is collapsing because insurers, unable to attract a balanced risk pool, have been losing money, raising prices, and in some cases pulling out of markets altogether.
unitedhealth, which is the top seller of short-term plans today, has reported a medical loss ratio on these policies of nearly 44 percent. the mlr, as it's known, refers to the portion of premium payments that go into actual care, which is another way of saying that roughly 56 percent of the premium dollars for unitedhealth's short-term plans end up as some combination of overhead and profit.

here are four other takeaways from the 2020 democratic national convention:
his strength and his weakness are that he's been a loyal trump bot, said lottsfeldt, who likened sullivan and trump to siamese twins.
but his agenda never really changed.
her message was very open to everyone, said washington gov. jay inslee, who chaired the democratic governors association during abrams' run and funneled about $4.5 million to support her. it was about economic opportunity. it wasn't exotic or avant-garde.
she said in her role on the commission, she has spent a considerable amount of time looking at these sorts of confederate monuments and their history. most were not put up right after the civil war but were erected after reconstruction in response to the rise of the social and economic power of black people. others went up during the civil rights movement.
fraley said he received 65 emails in a single weekend from people requesting to become precinct chairs, a thankless job that normally requires begging and pleading to get someone to fill. the county party has restructured and added five deputy chairs to channel all the energy, and created six new committees.
sen. joni ernst (r-iowa) says she doesn't think the supreme court will overturn its landmark 1973 roe v. wade abortion rights ruling, even though she signed a brief urging the court to do so earlier this year.
grayson cited his personal engagement with donors - a two-way conversation, he called it in an interview with opensecrets blog. [i]t's sort of an overused term, but i think it applies here: we've put together a movement. people enjoy participating, and feel it's important to them personally.
before the tax bill became law, the official republican argument was that workers would benefit from corporate tax cuts in the long run. companies would use their newfound extra cash for capital investments that would enhance worker productivity and make employees more valuable. that might still happen someday, though republicans have apparently set the argument aside.

patients also have trouble because, like many u.s. hospitals, uva bills people lacking coverage at rates far higher than what insurance companies pay on behalf of members. in addition, experts say such bills often have little connection to the cost of care. insurers obtain huge discounts off hospital sticker prices — 70% on average in uva's case, according to documents it files with medicare.
the white house and congressional republicans have spent the past week laying the groundwork to reject the cbo score of their legislation, perhaps anticipating the budget office would make unfavorable projections.
the five are jonathan adler from case western reserve university, nicholas bagley from the university of michigan, abbe gluck from yale university, ilya somin from george mason university and kevin walsh from the university of richmond.
whichever democrats perceive themselves as leaders need to sit in a room and not come out until they have a minimalist platform for 2018. and then they need to turn it over to their base as well as to voices that non-liberal voters trust (e.g., the moderate pastor, the centrist podcaster, etc.) for a good fleshing out, allowing all to see the dnc as representative of more than a narrow list of things that city-dwellers hate about republicans.
the trump administration brief was filed in support of a challenge to the aca by a coalition of republican governors.
discussion of how to build on the affordable care act and help americans still struggling with medical bills has been a dominant theme of the democratic presidential campaign. the topic is sure to come up when the candidates convene for more debates in detroit this week, especially on wednesday night when harris and biden, who clashed in last month's debate, share a stage.
another plausible contender for the job? chaffetz.
he also reminded viewers of how trump has used his platform to foment racist bloodlust against people of color, including the wrongfully accused central park five.
pro-obamacare spending was significantly higher for the month of june, accounting for a major reason democrats closed the gap: last month, there were nearly $4 million in pro-obamacare ads, compared with $1.1 million on the other side.
he noted that the administration has multiple options at its disposal, like interpreting the court decision narrowly, so that it only affects new mexico. it could also write a so-called interim rule that would allow payments to proceed.
three republican senators, including two who met with barrett in the oval office on sept. 26, also tested positive for covid-19. all three have recovered and are back at work.
the short answer: less coverage for more money.
denial of evolution and general scientific knowledge. i know you can't believe this, but a pew research poll showed that over 50 percent of republican voters don't accept the theory of evolution. when the core of the party thinks that the flintstones was a documentary -- and none of its presidential candidates dare say otherwise -- the broader implications for policies rooted in scientific inquiry are disturbing. hence people like trump who profit by suggesting that vaccination engenders autism.
the kentucky initiative also eliminates a transportation benefit, designed to get poor people to the doctor or hospital when they don't have the means to do so. and it ends retroactive eligibility, under which medicaid covers bills from the past three months for people who sign up for medicaid only after they've had a medical episode that landed them in the hospital.
that is why the democratic officials filed their second set of petitions friday. rather than let that long process play out, they would like the supreme court to hear the case as soon as possible and issue a ruling before its current term ends in the summer.
it's just unconscionable that on the backs of seniors they would pay for this huge corporate tax cut. hiral tipirneni, democratic candidate for arizona's 8th congressional district seat
it's equally important to have information about the hospital you choose, or that is included in your insurance plan. this site makes a pretty good attempt to rank hospitals for safety and outcomes.

drew angerer via getty images president donald trump is supporting a lawsuit that, if successful, would mean roughly 20 million people lose insurance, according to estimates.
i'm personally very active. now that's of course separate from my role as head of a nonpartisan organization. but who i am doesn't change at all. look at my twitter feed the last few days? i haven't changed who i am.
i voted since i was 18 so i participated in all the primaries and everything. i want someone who will defeat the current individual in the white house. kenneth stevenson, 62 your browser does not support the audio element.
biden's campaign last went on air in march, when sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) was still in the race for the democratic nomination. biden's campaign has focused its investments on social media so far — outspending trump on facebook. democratic political action committees, like priorities usa and american bridge, have been on the air in biden's place, focusing on trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
bevin seems to have learned firsthand that it was impossible to snap his fingers and make all that go away without upsetting a lot of people.
speaking about congress' reduced capacity during the extended recess, rep. jamie raskin (d-md.) — true to form — roughly invoked a woodrow wilson quote he learned in college: a congress in committee is a congress at work.
washington – president donald trump's white house wednesday began undermining the credibility of the congressional budget office – days ahead of its likely analysis that a republican health care plan will result in millions losing their insurance.
in florida, a lieutenant to rick scott, the governor now running for u.s. senate, blocked enrollment counselors from holding events in state buildings. in georgia, insurance commissioner ralph hudgens came right out and said he and his colleagues were doing everything in our power to be an obstructionist. in iowa and tennessee, state officials made it easy for people to stay out of the newly reformed markets ― and enroll, instead, in plans that don't comply with the aca's standards for benefits and open enrollment.
our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years. in afghanistan and iraq, nearly 7,000 american heroes have given their lives. more than 52,000 americans have been badly wounded. we have spent more than $7 trillion in the middle east.
either man's agenda would depend on outside political forces.
if there's a single policy she ties most closely to that theme, it's the wealth tax she hopes to levy on multimillion-dollar estates to fund priorities like free public college, student debt cancellation, paid family leave and public child care.
that breitbart would drop this 5-month-old recording now ― as ryan and the trump administration make their case for a health care bill to repeal and replace obamacare ― may appear surprising. after all, the site vigorously supported trump's candidacy and its former chairman, steve bannon, is chief strategist in the white house.
florida's republicans, at least, are beginning to side with democrats.
washington ― it's no exaggeration to say the biggest flashpoint in the democratic presidential race thus far has been health care ― namely, whether the united states should adopt medicare for all ― but there's a reality that hardly anyone is talking about: congress.
and every democratic candidates' proposals are a far, far cry from the policies president donald trump and the republican party seek, which amount to dramatically reducing access to health care, especially for people with low incomes.
the think tank is the center for american progress, which is based in washington and has close ties to the democratic party establishment. the proposal, which its authors call medicare extra for all, would create a new public program, based on medicare, that would be open to anybody.
hagwood is part of a large majority of black americans who don't believe the trump tax cuts will help them. according to a recent national survey, only 16 percent of black respondents said the new tax law will help their family's finances, while 34 percent, still only a third, of white respondents said they believed it would help their families.

newsom, who became governor this year, has said he wants california to be a progressive trailblazer. this budget, which also includes bursts of new spending on early childhood programs and new tax breaks for the working poor, represents just the kind of action that democrats in other states or in washington, d.c., could take quickly, if and when they get control of government.
and if someone humiliates leslie jones, they should just play nice and make sure that they're home for dinner.
but like the electoral college, the makeup of the senate is a misleading indicator of public sentiment; the small-state bias gives republicans disproportionate power. but it is also a fact of political life, one democrats at the moment are powerless to change.
most ministries will not help pay for medical services they say go against their christian faith. at the top of that list is abortion.
if moderates have ever had a chance to shape the obamacare discussion, this is the moment. which is why conservatives have so forcefully signaled that they won't support any repeal bill preserving the medicaid expansion. their goal is to close off the possibility that a repeal bill keeping those medicaid provisions could ever pass, leaving a measure that blows up the expansion as the only option for leaders.
aarp premiered a new video advertisement for the campaign on monday, suggesting it was ramping up its efforts to kill the provision.
the law states that for up to a year after the child's birth, an employer must provide the worker with a space to pump that's shielded from view and reasonable break time to pump ― although what's reasonable is not defined and can vary from one woman to the next. the employer doesn't have to pay the worker for that time unless it is break time the worker is normally paid for. employers with fewer than 50 workers can be exempted from the law if they can show it would be an undue hardship.
alex wong via getty images president donald trump earlier this month pledged that preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100% by republicans. yet since taking office, he has tried repeatedly to repeal and to undermine the affordable care act, including its insurance protections for people with preexisting conditions.
people are talking. yes, they're talking about khizr khan and his pocket constitution.
des moines, iowa – sen. john mccain repeatedly compared president donald trump to a dictator during trump's inaugural address, minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, a democratic white house contender and friend of the late arizonan, told a crowd of voters here.
i understand you don't like the (biden) plan, tim, but i'm merely pointing out that you don't have a plan, the anchor said. the president has said for three years he's going have to a plan. it's going to be better. i understand the criticisms of obamacare. we've all heard them. we've all dealt with it. you got rid of it and there's been no plan put out to replace it and no specifics. why is it taking so long? why is it now going to come right before election day?
jorjani will appear thursday alongside mark lee greenblatt, trump's nominee to serve as interior inspector general. mary kendall, the deputy inspector general who oversaw investigations into former interior secretary ryan zinke's conduct, is set to retire this month. if confirmed, greenblatt, now the assistant inspector general for investigations at the department of commerce, would take over several ongoing probes.
why pre-existing conditions are a tough issue for republicans
i had no idea how to run a congressional office, the four-term congressman said in december. as a result, i allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.
days later, it became apparent that trump's anxieties were being felt widely among republican legislators, with a half-dozen lawmakers call[ing] publicly for slowing down the process. as the huffington post reports:
access to health care in places like georgia looks more and more different than it does in california.
the most recent change came from washington early this month, when the trump administration made it easier for people to buy short-term insurance that leaves out key benefits like mental health and prescriptions and isn't available to people with pre-existing conditions. the plans hare tantalizingly low premiums, but they can expose beneficiaries to crushing medical costs ― all while driving up the price of more comprehensive coverage.
she's a rich woman who lives in a big, beautiful house in california who wants to give all of your money away, trump said of pelosi during a speech in ohio. and she talked about crumbs.
administrations don't typically concede so much, so soon in the face of district court decisions, bagley said. otherwise, a lone judge could throw an entire agency's work into disarray, he added.
by that time, the donald's current spat with elon musk will have ended. only then, will messrs. musk and trump figure out the way forward. the success of the f-nafta campaign, will pave the way for us mastery of the skies.
mcconnell reiterated monday morning that he would move to vote on an immigration bill if the two sides can't agree to one by feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open.
the price to the federal government is likely to be $750 to $850 billion over 10 years, according to the latest (and still very rough) projections. but biden came right out and said that on thursday night ― and pointed out, accurately, that the money would make it possible for people to get better plans, cheaper plans.
that's a lot! and while that average obscures even higher average increases in some states ― including those on the order of what trump claims here ― that doesn't make 25 percent phony. it's how averages work.
the big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.
the evolution of america--the course by which we became bigger, stronger, and richer and more dynamic, and a more inclusive nation. but america's progress has never been smooth or steady. progress doesn't travel in a straight line. it zigs and zags in fits and starts. progress in america has been hard and contentious, and sometimes bloody. it remains uneven and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like we take one step back. but progress is bumpy. it always has been. but because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists, progress has been this nation's hallmark. i'm fond of quoting dr. martin luther king, jr., who said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. (applause.) it bends towards justice. i believe that. but i also believe that the arc of our nation, the arc of the world does not bend towards justice, or freedom, or equality, or prosperity on its own. it depends on us, on the choices we make, particularly at certain inflection points in history; particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs. [snip] isolating or disparaging muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country -- (applause) -- that is not just a betrayal of our values -- (applause) -- that's not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism.
although buttigieg has said he supports regulation, his plan calls for a much milder form. it would simply set a ceiling on what doctors, hospitals and other providers can charge when they haven't successfully negotiated with insurers to be part of their networks.
even covid-19 deaths weren't enough to shake most partisans
the rush to confirm barrett, 48, has bitterly divided democrats and republicans, who are expected to split largely along party lines on the final vote. trump has said he expects the court to decide the election's outcome and wants barrett to participate on any election-related cases that go before the justices.
among congressional candidates, few can approach sanders. but the house and senate leaders by this measure were both sanders supporters. tim canova leads house contenders and congress overall with 76 percent of his contributions from small donors -- about 11 times the house average of 6.9 percent this cycle.
the lawsuit's key argument is that congress intended for the pre-existing condition protections to work in tandem with the law's individual mandate, the provision that people have insurance or pay a penalty. now that congress has decided to zero out the penalty, as republicans did last year as part of the 2017 tax cut, the pre-existing conditions have to go, too.
that would be a great incentive to get people in the door, said tara straw, a health policy analyst with the center on budget and policy priorities, which advocates on behalf of low-income people. more generous help would be available not just to the newly enrolled, but to all who are covered through the law's marketplaces.
among the other individuals and organizations filing briefs on thursday were groups representing doctors and patients, including the american cancer society, america's health insurance plans, the american heart association, the american medical association and the national multiple sclerosis society.
but here, too, roberts had a change of heart and, according to biskupic, two liberal justices, elena kagan and stephen breyer, perceived a deal in the making. they ended up voting with roberts and the four other conservatives to invalidate part of the medicaid expansion, effectively making that part of the affordable care act optional for states.
the case will go before a three-member panel, chosen at random, although it could potentially get a subsequent en banc hearing before all of the active judges, with a possible supreme court hearing after that.
collins, who is up for re-election in 2020, said readler's attack on obamacare is why she opposed his confirmation.
his emphasis on fatherhood -- which obama has said stems from his own childhood with an absent dad -- could have a concrete impact on kids if emulated. studies show that children with engaged fathers have higher cognitive ability and stronger literacy skills. children with engaged parents are also likelier to be healthy and have less emotional distress. and by emphasizing equality in parenting, obama is making strides for women as well.
i have no problem making referrals over to the department of justice if there's an obstruction of our investigation into agency employees, he said. i'll have doj on speed dial if i need to.
polls show mcsally trailing her democratic opponent, former astronaut mark kelly, who has been pounding away at her record, just as polls show trump trailing biden in the white house race.
they have to pay full price and, in some instances, coverage comes to more than 20 percent of their household incomes. and that's before taking into account out-of-pocket expenses.
washington (ap) — president donald trump unveiled a $4.8 trillion election year budget plan on monday that recycles deep, previously rejected cuts to domestic programs like food stamps, medicaid, and housing as the recipe for wrestling the federal budget back into balance.
the urban institute projects that congressional gop leaders' preferred plan ― dubbed repeal and delay because they would pass legislation to repeal major parts of obamacare but leave most of them in place for up to four years while they devise a new policy ― could destabilize the health care system and result in as many as 30 million people losing their health benefits.
but 2018 is shaping up as a more difficult year for republicans and this time bishop is running against elissa slotkin, a former intelligence officer who did three tours in iraq and later served in the obama administration. the cook political report calls the race a toss-up. so does fivethirtyeight.com. and if slotkin wins in michigan's 8th district, a big reason will be bishop's longtime support for repealing the affordable care act (aka obamacare).
another worrisome sign for proponents of medicare for all is that americans, despite the many documented shortcomings of private health insurance, continue to rate it positively.
collins is called a centrist, but at least with regard to judicial nominees, it might be more useful to see her as a formalist. playing politics with judicial nominees is profoundly damaging to the senate's reputation and stature, she said in a speech explaining her vote to confirm neil gorsuch in 2017. it politicizes our judicial nomination process and threatens the independence of our courts, which are supposed to be above partisan politics.

mental health advocates have vowed to fight against any legislation that threatens those living with mental illness. this includes pushing for other laws that help those individuals and promoting programs that help them get treated, said linda rosenberg, president and ceo of the national council for behavioral health.
single-payer is still the main topic of political discussion in california, and among the moves newsom made on monday was to send a letter to the trump administration and congressional leaders calling for legislation that would give states like his the authority to craft their own single-payer systems.
the worries may be unnecessary. the request for briefs could be nothing more than due diligence from some judges who care about legal procedure. but, given the history of the health care law, the trump administration's decision to support the lawsuit and the initial ruling in its favor, it seems entirely possible that this unserious legal argument is about to get very serious consideration ― not for the first time and maybe not for the last.
likewise in contrast to trump, all 10 democrats who appeared at thursday's debate endorsed allowing undocumented immigrants access to federal health care programs, which would mark a major shift in government policy. under current law, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all forms of federal assistance except limited, emergency benefits.
meghan mccain, the senator's talk show host daughter, indicated earlier this year that the white house has offered her family private apologies for some of the president's remarks in the past. but she added that trump's attacks are something she's never going to forgive.
it is sending seniors a 2-foot rope to get themselves out of a 10-foot hole, said sabrina corlette, a professor at georgetown university's health policy institute.
the event on saturday was the latest of a number of recent town hall meetings in which constituents have angrily confronted gop elected officials about their efforts to repeal the affordable care act.
some republicans in primaries who are trying to prove their conservative credentials have been hitting each other for not doing enough to repeal obamacare. but beyond that, when republicans do run ads on health care, they look more like what gov. scott walker (r) is doing in wisconsin, with a focus on the rising costs and how states can act.

coverage for more people, and more affordable coverage
the president was confronted by a voter over the issue at an abc town hall earlier this month. during a heated exchange, ellesia blaque detailed her struggle to pay thousands of dollars a year in copayments despite being covered by insurance.
josephson is pleased with the coverage her family has had since the aca was enacted, which has enabled them to get regular medical care. that included an exhaustive physical exam for her after her husband, dave, died suddenly in 2018. she felt fortunate to have access to those services, which reassured her that she was healthy and would be there for her children, she said.
the trump administration's new rules for short-term/limited-duration insurance plans are a good example of this. as the name suggests, these plans are supposed to be temporary stopgaps for people with brief lapses in coverage. for that reason, they aren't subject to the usual rules about pre-existing conditions and mandatory benefits.
the retired california hedge fund manager definitely has the money to appear omnipresent in south carolina, where black voters made up 61% of the democratic primary electorate back in 2016. he has overwhelmingly outspent every other democrat in the race not named bloomberg on media, with his campaign pouring $139.8 million into television and digital ads.
government antitrust officials argued that both deals would lead to less competition and higher prices for americans. the acquisitions would have reduced the number of large national u.s. insurers from five to three.
but those subsidies are available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level, which comes to about $47,000 a year for a single person. the average annual earnings for a maid working full time are less than half of that, according to the bureau of labor statistics.
in the summer of 2004, i was assigned to cover the democratic national convention in boston by black entertainment television (bet), in partnership with cbs. so i found myself roaming through that city's fleetcenter wondering if then-sen. john kerry, the party's nominee for president, could actually defeat president george w. bush and the republican party's uncanny ability to make him seem like a woefully unqualified and unpatriotic candidate.
democrats have long thought texas would one day be in reach. if 2020 is the year texas goes blue, or at least blue-ish, the wave will likely run through suburban districts like gop rep. dan crenshaw's.
vice president-elect mike pence renewed the pledge to repeal obamacare during a visit to capitol hill on wednesday. the first order of business is to repeal and replace obamacare, and that was our message today and it will be our message on capitol hill, he said. it needs to be done.
the aca isn't perfect. but it is a crucial step toward remedying a broken health insurance system that only works for a select group of people. and right now it's more important than ever that everyone is able to access affordable comprehensive health care as we continue to battle a deadly pandemic that has killed over 230,000 people, is making many more sick, and is causing unknown but increasingly alarming long-term effects for those who survive.
cost effectiveness analysis (cea), as applied to health care, attempts to estimate the value of expenditures on procedures or treatments that is returned to patients, such as longer life, better quality of life, or both. given that the u. s. has the most expensive health care in the world, with comparatively low value and outcomes compared to many other advanced countries, you would think that cea would be a major part of health policy in this country. sadly, the opposite is true, and it is notably absent from the way we do things.
now there's a new lawsuit from 20 republican state officials who say that the entire program must go because of one, supposedly unconstitutional, provision. it prevailed in federal district court late last year, setting up a hearing before the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit and, depending on the outcome there, in the u.s. supreme court ― maybe just before the 2020 election, maybe just after.
so far, republican lawmakers appear to be willing to face those consequences. as huffpost's matt fuller reported, the house appears poised to have a majority of lawmakers supporting wiping obamacare off the books. the dynamics in the senate are less certain, since all democrats need to do (assuming they vote uniformly) is convince three republicans to cross the aisle. but with trump now fully embracing repeal, lawmakers on the hill feel additional pressure to place their focus on the replacement instead.
luckily, the actor used his star trek powers to extricate himself and colbert from their precarious position.
i am the only candidate in this race who will bring our manufacturing jobs back, he wrote in a march 2016 op-ed in usa today.
the reality is that no one — trump, the democratic-controlled house or the gop-held senate — has any interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends. the white house plan proposes $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade.
the article has been updated to include comments from the biden and sanders campaigns, as well as additional information about the role of employers provided by the harris campaign after introducing its plan publicly.

but in november, a federal district judge sided with the plaintiffs, declaring the affordable care act was unconstitutional. it was a big victory for the 20 gop state officials who brought the case as well as for president donald trump, who had the u.s. justice department file a brief supporting the case.
she said costs are sometimes lower, too, because members are paying cash and their medical providers are not dealing with an insurance company.
association health plans allow employers in the same field to band together to get a better deal on benefits for their workers. think small companies that belong to the same trade group. that's all pretty reasonable, and this type of plan has existed for a while.
tom williams via getty images house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer are heeding norms of decorum that undermine their power.
ok, so you come up with a policy with a group of folks. it might not be a policy that bernie sanders or other members of the progressive left think is awesome or ideal. but it's a bipartisan policy. but there's a reason that paul ryan and mitch mcconnell aren't on the board of your organization ...
but biden also recognizes that one of the affordable care act's biggest shortcomings is that it didn't do enough to help people who have access to employer-sponsored coverage but can't afford the premiums or out-of-pocket costs that come with the policies. these workers, many of them low-income, hourly employees, struggle with payments or turn down the coverage altogether.
in fact, special interests and those frightened of change, are challenging evidence-based efforts to evaluate health care system innovations and high-cost drug treatments. instead of fighting these efforts, they should be demanding more of them and insist that patient voices are part of the discussion.
but a bipartisan effort to amend obamacare broke down in the senate because of a dispute over whether federal funding could go to insurance plans that cover abortions, not a democratic unwillingness to negotiate. even that legislation was almost certain to go nowhere in the more conservative, gop-controlled house anyway.
this is a huge win-win for virginia to have two incredibly effective leaders going toe-to-toe over just how much they have done to raise wages, advance racial and gender equality and reform corrupt state monopolies, said former rep. tom perriello (d-va.), a progressive who challenged northam for the democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2017. in the fight to be the next governor of virginia and the first black woman governor in america, the jennifers are setting an exciting new standard for leadership and progress.
it could be a long wait. but it's been a long wait already. and sometimes that's what it takes for a law's impact to become clear.
attacking obama was a common theme among candidates in that race. texas sen. ted cruz frequently rallied his audiences by promising to repeal every word of obamacare and rip the iran nuclear deal to shreds on his first day in office. florida sen. marco rubio suggested that obama's policies were not merely misguided but intentionally designed to hurt america.
the current debate over medicare for all really has nothing to do with health care, it's all about greed and huge profits, sanders planned to say at a news conference, according to prepared remarks his office circulated in advance. it is about whether we maintain a dysfunctional system which allows health insurance companies and drug companies to make tens of billions of dollars in profits and their ceos to make outrageous compensation packages.
because of that automatic enrollment provision, medicare for america could get to truly universal coverage. you can't say the same thing about alternatives that call simply for more modest expansions of government-run insurance and subsidies that other democrats have proposed.
there's a significance behind this debate. there are 21 million u.s. veterans, and while their total number is on the decline, there's an increase in applications for va health care. as this conversation evolves there's a clear need to understand the different viewpoints to create the best long-term solution.
regardless of whether cruz's amendment is included, a vote on the motion to proceed may be going down anyway. sen. susan collins (r-maine) told politico on tuesday she was not optimistic that this would be a bill she could support, and sen. dean heller (r-nev.) famously expressed a number of issues with the bill in a high-profile news conference in june ― issues that would largely be exacerbated or unaddressed with the addition of cruz's amendment.
the race gives democrats a chance to take down a gop rising star.
a plurality of the public thinks the senate should vote to confirm neil gorsuch as a supreme court justice, according to a newly released huffpost/yougov poll, although many say they've paid relatively little attention to the process.
democrats in crucial battleground and republican-leaning states are hammering their gop opponents for opposing expanding medicaid to more residents in those states, a sign of how firmly the party has seized the political advantage on health care a decade after the passage of obamacare.
11. brenner, dj, hall, ej. computed tomography--an increasing source of radiation exposure. n engl j med 357: 2277-2284, 2007.
the second thing that should worry republicans, hanauer and democrats say, is the emerging reality of the gop's health care plan ― and the impact it will have on trump voters.
by decreased choice and access. even with the aca, insurers have many ways to limit choice and access to care, including high-deductible plans (annual deductibles of5,000 for an individual and10,000 for families are part of bronze policies), narrow networks without coverage of out-of-network costs, high co-insurance for specialty drugs, restrictive definitions of medical necessity, and denial of services.
because he had a preexisting condition, blitz couldn't find insurance coverage before the aca. under the law, he was guaranteed access to coverage and even received a small subsidy to help make it more affordable. before the aca, he spent $15,000 a year on cardiology tests. by 2014, those costs were down to $4,000, including his monthly insurance premiums.
he's trying to undermine it right now.
the pandemic is making that goal seem ever more remote.
though there is no national data on hospital debt collection, uva's pursuit of patients goes beyond that of a number of institutions. johns hopkins hospital in baltimore has sued patients 240 times a year on average, according to a may report in the baltimore sun. uva, by comparison, often sues that many former patients in a week and averages more than 6,000 cases annually, court data show.
biden's new proposal, which includes plans to expand federal subsidies and create a public option comparable to medicare, stands as an alternative to the medicare for all system supported by presidential candidates including sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.).
we see too well what lies ahead. after november, trump will go after robert mueller and his superiors at the justice department, acting as a third-world authoritarian to shield his gross misconduct ― the very reason devin nunes told donors that the gop must retain a house majority.
these guys. that's a typical politician bullshit line, said ray pfeifer, a former new york city firefighter who counts himself lucky to be still battling cancers linked to sept. 11. they want to be patriots when it's convenient for them.
almost nothing is certain at this point except perhaps that a ruling to strike down the law would be devastating to millions of americans, whether it's people who get medicaid or subsidized private insurance from the law ― or benefit from its protections for people with preexisting conditions.
stories like danielle's were relatively common before the 2010 health care law took effect. insurance companies selling to individuals rather than through employers routinely scoured medical records for signs that new claims were actually the result of pre-existing conditions that beneficiaries had not disclosed.
to be clear, some people would have saved some money. in particular, those in relatively good health or willing to take their chances with thinner coverage would see their premiums come down, sometimes dramatically.
think 130 times more people than shown in this photo of the stadium at the university of michigan.
what the medicaid expansion has meant for opioid treatment
the budget would cut an estimated $920 billion from medicaid over 10 years, by tightening restrictions and federal matching funds for states that expanded the program. and the budget would cut money from other obamacare-related programs as well, all while the trump administration continues its efforts to strike down the affordable care act in the courts.
republicans argue jct's analysis of the tax changes shouldn't include the repeal of the obamacare mandate or the related loss of the obamacare tax credit because americans who qualify for it can still choose to buy health insurance and get the subsidy, and the credit isn't directly paid to them.
it's clear that there were still plenty of americans who looked at this record and agreed with trump's take ― or, at the very least, did not hold him responsible for the pandemic's impact.
a group of citizen advocates, spearheaded by the minnesota brain injury alliance, are spending tuesdays at the capitol in an effort to bring their personal stories to the forefront of their legislature's radar.

well it depends on how you structure the credit because, in fact, seniors are more expensive, but if you offset that by giving them a greater credit you can make sure that they're not hurt by the reality that seniors use more health care, she said.
meghan mccain, co-host of abc's the view, said in a tweet earlier this month that she was traveling home to see her parents. she said on the view that she planned to fly back and forth from new york for a time. so just know if i'm not here, i'm hanging out with my dad and my mom, she said.
jorjani didn't exactly reprimand roddy as he described on thursday. rusty - not your fault, he wrote before blaming another staffer for failing to prepare the paperwork ahead of the trip.
the walker campaign, meanwhile, is trying to turn evers into a figure exciting enough for republicans to oppose. the incumbent governor has a significant spending advantage, according to operatives on both sides, and has aired 34 different ads this cycle, attacking evers as a tax-and-spend liberal. they've lately slammed him for plagiarizing parts of his budget documents — evers has apologized, and said the works were improperly cited.
like all projections on the effects of health care policy changes, this latest one is subject to plenty of uncertainty ― in other words, the precise figures aren't actually that precise. but urban's model is widely cited and respected, and few experts would dispute that it is directionally correct.
but fate has been less kind to the so-called cadillac tax, which is designed to make more expensive insurance plans less financially attractive. a 2015 spending agreement postponed introduction of the tax by two years, to 2020. the spending agreement congress passed and trump signed last month pushes it back two more and, at this point, it's unlikely to take effect ever. as with ipab, it counts among its enemies members of both political parties.
this is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier ― not just a simple concrete wall. it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
gop senators who staunchly oppose obamacare and believe that the supreme court erred in upholding it openly doubled down on that position tuesday, blasting supreme court chief justice john roberts for allowing its survival. but they, too, claimed that the new lawsuit doesn't present a mortal threat to obamacare.
there would be no reason to move to a high-risk pool, because a high-risk pool is not funded, he said. so, i would just stay in the traditional program on the exchange.
president donald trump and congressional republicans failed to repeal the affordable care act last year despite making a real go at it, and conservative activists and state officials failed in two previous attempts to get the supreme court to overturn or upend the law. now they're trying again to get the judiciary to do their dirty work for them.
ohio gov. john kasich (r), for one, is set to meet with senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch (r-utah) as well as other committee members next week to discuss his concerns about full repeal, a source close to kasich confirmed. michigan gov. rick snyder (r), meanwhile, has been in talks with members of michigan's delegation as well as president-elect donald trump's transition staff about maintaining his state's medicaid expansion program.
the senate will vote thursday to confirm eric murphy, 39, to join readler on the 6th circuit. murphy, the state solicitor of ohio, fought to make it easier to disenfranchise voters. he also filed briefs to the supreme court arguing against marriage equality in the landmark 2015 obergefell v. hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide and against reproductive rights.
that's because insurers would be allowed to sell skimpier plans that cover fewer things and would increase policyholders' deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. the federal government would also partially reimburse insurance companies for high-cost patients. the affordable care act requires insurance policies to cover at least 60 percent of expected medical costs; the republican bill includes no such requirement and would permit policies that cover less.
deborah breedlove, 65, who served as a south carolina nominating delegate for barack obama in 2008, said she believed harrison would change her state forever.
the district is a y-shaped cutout of neighborhoods south of boston; a democratic stronghold of some of the most progressive parts of the city with an influx of young professionals, and historically conservative irish catholic working-class neighborhoods that have shifted over time.
so you can forgive jeff lyle, a big fan of christie's, for comparing the 36-bed community hospital he runs in marlin, texas, to one of those unfortunate guests. in december, two nearby hospitals, one almost 40 miles away, the other 60 miles away, closed their doors for good.
like so many kentuckians, i was and am inspired by the powerful movement charles booker built toward the causes of defeating mitch mcconnell and fighting systemic racism and injustice in our country, mcgrath said in the email to supporters. he tapped into and amplified the energy and anger of so many who are fed up with the status quo and are rightfully demanding long-overdue action and accountability from our government and institutions.
sen. orrin hatch (r-utah) is apparently sick of people who support affordable health care.
but there is some momentum behind democrats here, party leaders insist, and, at the very least, the national perception that kentucky is a deep red state verging on lost-cause status isn't a view they share.
after ryan released a slightly revised version of the budget one year later, robert greenstein, president of the center on budget and policy priorities, called it a remarkable document — one that, for most of the past half-century, would have been outside the bounds of mainstream discussion due to its extreme nature.

mike pence has been on a one-man crusade against planned parenthood and access to reproductive health care for nearly a decade. he introduced six different measures to block access to basic health care while in congress, and was willing to shut down the government rather than allow women and men to get basic health care at planned parenthood. as governor, he signed into law one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. this is the nightmare the trump-pence ticket is offering: to unite their party against women.
it was the sort of talk that labor leaders have been eager to hear as the primary heats up. as huffpost reported earlier this week, richard trumka, the head of the 55-union afl-cio labor federation, told all the campaigns at a closed-door meeting wednesday that democrats had failed unions in the past and shouldn't take their support for granted anymore.

times of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. that leads to higher medicaid spending. and a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. during the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of americans enrolled in medicaid.

his critique of sullivan is that much sharper because murkowski, alaska's senior senator, provided one of three republican no votes that ended up sinking the july 2017 repeal bill. at the time, murkowski worried that without a clear path forward, repealing the aca, which funded an expansion of medicaid that has extended coverage to an additional 60,000 alaskans since 2015, would have hurt alaska.

that might be an easier task after video resurfaced on tuesday of buttigieg addressing a tea party group in 2010, when the conservative activist movement was seeking to torpedo the affordable care act.
last time i looked, interior lawyers are responsible for protecting the best interests of the american people before those of the secretary or special interests, wyden said.
that raises the question of why courts should even hear the lawsuit, let alone end a program on which tens of millions depend for health care.
when trump finally unveiled a series of executive orders aimed at lowering drug prices in july, health care experts panned the measures as relatively insignificant. for example, an order forcing pharmaceutical companies to give cash rebates to medicare beneficiaries, rather than the middlemen who negotiate discounts, would likely just increase medicare premiums and the federal government's costs.
as fareed zakaria put it in his washington post column, the democrats are betting on good old fashioned american virtues. they're keeping optimistic and hoping that america will take the side of sunny ways and reject the idea that somehow, their country needs to be made great again.
still, even many progressives would concede that the transition to medicare for all would be difficult. if you want most people to end up better off financially, taking into account what they pay today (as premiums and out-of-pocket expenses) versus what they'd pay for the new system (in taxes), then, according to most projections, the government would have to squeeze the health care industry's income.
but the bill isn't entirely focused on helping the most needy or deserving.

republicans control 33 of the nation's governorships, a record. and the republican governors association is a political heavyweight, regularly outraising its democratic counterpart by a two-to-one margin. with trump's approval ratings in the low 40s and a high-energy democratic base, republicans were already expected to lose governorships in the fall, especially in blue-tinted states like maine and new mexico. trump's meddling in gop primaries, along with republican voters' desire for candidates who ape trump's style, could expand those losses to swing states ― florida and minnesota ― and even into the red territory of georgia and kansas.
the state doesn't have a history of successful ballot initiatives and referenda. in order to get medicaid expansion on the ballot, reclaim idaho has to get 56,000 signatures, which would meet the threshold of 6 percent of the state's registered voters. but under the law, they have to meet the same 6 percent threshold in 18 of idaho's 35 state legislative districts. they have until may 1 to submit their petitions.
despite bad trade deals that have sent jobs overseas for years, mike braun has built a business that's been creating high-paying jobs only in america for nearly 40 years, spokesman josh kelley said. while senator donnelly's company sent hoosier jobs to mexico, mike has only created jobs here in america.
while much of the debate centered on the skirmishes among the front-runners, lower-tiered candidates ― some of whom are in danger of failing to qualify for the third debate ― also made their presence felt.
it's a tall order. generic ballot polls show democrats currently have a roughly seven-point advantage over republicans this election cycle. huffpost has identified eight races to watch if 2020 turns out to not only be a successful year for democrats, but a blowout. this is by no means an exhaustive list.
fox news host sean hannity fired off a series of angry messages on twitter late thursday night after a wall street journal editor described him as the network's dumbest anchor.
maine's senate race has shaped up to be one of the more-watched contests in 2020 with vast amounts of money pouring in from out of state. winning collins' seat is key for democrats hoping to flip the senate in november. a crowdfunding campaign organized around the kavanaugh vote has raked in millions of dollars for whoever wins the democratic nomination.

even if the individual mandate were unconstitutional, the law's defenders argued in briefs earlier this year that the rest of the law remains legally viable.
going into this week's debate, the biggest question on everyone's mind was whether biden would recover from his shaky performance in last month's debate in miami, which cost him in the polls after he got caught flat-footed in an exchange with sen. kamala harris (calif.) over his record on race.
since voting against repealing obamacare in 2017, collins' support among maine voters has suffered, and it dropped even further after her vocal support for kavanaugh's nomination. last month, a morning consult tracking poll showed the maine republican had surpassed mcconnell as the most unpopular senator in the country.

the national federation of independent business has been pushing congress and federal agencies to loosen the rules for association health plans for many years, and has long viewed them as a way to make it easier for their members to offer health coverage to small-business workers. trump even announced his association health plans initiative at an nfib event in june.
when the intercept revealed this week that pelosi's top health care staffer met with blue cross blue shield executives and criticized medicare for all, progressives generally took a pass on attacking pelosi.
under the trump policy, announced in january, a state facing increasing medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. the alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. and given that this proposal is designed to appeal to republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.
kavanaugh said no to both inquiries.
as usual, people like jeff flake, john mccain, martha mcsally want to fight against the conservative voice, the voice of the people, she said. i'm not going to allow it to happen.
another of the speakers is a pastor and cancer survivor, the other a retired educator with a chronic autoimmune disorder. both will talk about how much the law's protections for preexisting conditions have meant to them ― a theme joe biden almost assuredly will emphasize in his speech accepting the democratic party's nomination for president.
the proposal would also eliminate the individual mandate. the mandate exists to make sure healthy people buy coverage, rather than waiting until they get sick. the continuous coverage provision is supposed to serve the same function, but many experts believe it is not as effective.
but the money the bill allocated to the pools was well below what analysts said was necessary to provide people with the kind of protection they get today. that's not at all surprising, given that high-risk pools existed before and suffered from chronic underfunding.
that includes parents, pregnant women who earn just over the poverty level, and adults who live in states that expanded medicaid under the affordable care act. the lowest-income pregnant women are exempt, as are people over 65, patients in long-term care, and individuals who receive federal disability benefits.

the democratic senatorial campaign committee, which has made six-figure investments in arizona and montana, transferred just under $50,000 to gross' campaign ― a fraction of the sum that gross himself has contributed. the senate majority pac, the democratic senate super pac with ties to party leaders, has stayed on the sidelines entirely.
the supreme court almost certainly won't take up a republican lawsuit to eliminate the affordable care act before the presidential election this year, justices announced tuesday.
hatch's comments came the same day the kaiser family foundation released a poll saying the affordable care act was popular with 54 percent of the population.
across the board, what it does is shift costs from younger people to older people, said timothy jost, a leading health reform expert and emeritus professor at the washington and lee university school of law.
kellyanne conway recently gave a wide-ranging interview with the record from her home in alpine, new jersey, where she lives with her husband and four children.

what lucas appreciates most about the affordable care act is that it enables people like him to get insurance regardless of their preexisting conditions.
my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
but even seemingly moderate legislation can be difficult to pass. the history of democratic attempts at health care reform, which goes back nearly a century now, features a lot more more failure than success ― and it's why even people who share the goal of universal coverage can come away with such different views on how to get there.

we've willingly turned hate and racism into the next big hit, money making honey boo boo quality reality show.
interviews with activists in 24 states ― red, blue and purple ― reveal a strikingly similar pattern: shocked by the outcome of the election and fearful for the future of the country, people of all ages, some of them democrats, some independents, some greens, found the time and location of a local party meeting and showed up. here are a few of their stories:
americans who lost jobs and job-based health benefits from a company with at least 20 employees can opt to remain in their current health insurance, typically for 18 months but sometimes longer. cobra ― named after the law that created it, the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 ― gives former employees that right.
the 48-year-old appellate court judge declared her conservative views in often colloquial language, aligned with the late justice antonin scalia, a mentor for whom she also clerked after law school.
but while trump may have helped his republican colleagues recognize the trap they were in, it's anybody's guess as to whether he can truly lead them out of it. over the course of the presidential campaign, trump offered up any number of opinions on what the state of american health care should ideally resemble, but those were restricted to vague principles and few specifics.

the tax bill slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, a windfall democrats said companies would waste on share buybacks instead of more productive investment. after trump signed the bill into law, republicans seized on news that dozens of companies announced they would give their workers bonuses specifically because of the law.
even though the comments were 99 to 1 opposing the waivers, they approved them anyway, lower-basch said.
the tax policy center estimated that american households, on average, would have 2.2 percent more after-tax income this year, though the richest 5 percent would see the biggest benefit.
that blew the doors off previous conventions, especially considering it's an off-year, said herb helzer, a member of the northville democratic club. sure, plenty of people showed up for the midterms in 2014 or 2012. ... but this is winter 2017 after the biggest trouncing we've gotten.
if it wasn't for obamacare, we would probably have a million-dollar health care bill or more, stevenson said.
now, with more than 50 million votes already cast in the upcoming election, republicans are rushing to confirm barrett, a conservative judge who clerked for the late justice antonin scalia. her appointment would solidify a 6-3 conservative majority on the supreme court for the foreseeable future ― a majority that could block democrats' priorities even if joe biden wins the white house next month.
because he has demonstrated a willingness to express his views on existing supreme court precedents, he must be able to answer direct questions on roe and health care, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said in a conference call with reporters on monday. kavanaugh's past comments, schumer added, undercut any claim that he cannot and should not be able to answer questions about his beliefs in specific cases.
it's only the most recent of many unilateral moves trump has made on social policy, which all seek to fulfill an inauguration day promise to get our people off of welfare and back to work.
in press interviews, he's said he'll push back against trump when he needs to. james' campaign and the official campaign arm for senate republicans did not respond to multiple huffpost interview requests.
as a top legal operative at the federal agency, jorjani has also met extensively with industry lobbyists, trade groups and corporate executives, as pacific standard reported, and played a key role in rolling back several obama-era regulations. in december, he authored an interpretation of the migratory bird treaty act that protects energy companies and other parties from being prosecuted for unintentionally killing birds. that same month he renewed controversial leases for the twin metals copper and nickel mine in minnesota following a lobbying blitz by the leaseholder, chilean company antofagasta, plc.
the affordable care act requires health insurance plans to include 10 categories of benefits, including hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care and emergency-room services. each state chooses an existing policy in its market as a benchmark for these benefits.

what republicans really tried to do about health care
republicans are eager for ways to use pelosi in political campaigns regardless of what she says, since people generally view her unfavorably.
the senate, for its part, has made no apparent progress on health care legislation and isn't expected to simply accept what the house proposes.
sen. john kennedy (r-la.) told huffpost that the medicaid system and the expansion under obamacare is already a failure, and that states would be able to do more with less ― in the form of block grants ― if they get more flexibility.
in a scrum with reporters during the gop retreat two weeks ago, chaffetz downplayed his feud with the ethics chief. i just think he stepped out of bounds a little bit, he said. but he made it clear during that session with the press just how uninterested he is in investigating the president.
now imagine fifty variants of this on rotation, each emphasizing a transpartisan goal while hinting at the required work of getting there, each shining a light on the deeper infrastructure of the beautiful american machine, each laying bare the practical mechanics of greatness, each showing democrats actually doing something.
that energy showed its force in wisconsin state senate district 10. democrat patty schachtner pulled off a surprise victory in a special election in this district bordering minnesota in january, winning by 11 percentage points.
we'll see if the cruz strategy works. cruz attacks trump on issues, for example, trump's support for universal health care. trump replies he merely wants whatever works to take care of the people so they are not dying in the middle of the street. a half century ago, ronald reagan's campaign slogan for governor was common sense answers to california's problems. trump now calls himself a common sense conservative.
the biden campaign was quick to attack harris, arguing that she had changed her position and was still pushing a plan that would require too much disruption and too many new taxes.
his health insurance company at the time didn't want to cover his medical bills and relented only in the face of a lawsuit.
for jill hanauer, who runs the progressive election research and strategy outfit project new america, the landscape is starting to remind her of colorado in 2004, when democrats did especially well, running in part on a health care message.
kavanaugh's views on matters like abortion and health care are under extreme scrutiny. he indicated through speeches and written opinions that he opposes abortion rights and thinks roe, a decision he described last year as part of a tide of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights, was wrongly decided. two moderate republican senators who support abortion rights ― susan collins (maine) and lisa murkowski (alaska) ― are facing pressure in their home states to block his nomination. while collins has said she will not support a nominee who has demonstrated hostility to roe v. wade, she has defended kavanaugh from criticism.
vulnerable republican senators up for re-election in 2020, whose seats democrats need to win in order to take back control of the senate, are likely to face additional attacks over health care following the trump administration's new stance on the lawsuit. but gop leaders say they have confidence in their members to fend off attacks over obamacare going into the 2020 election.
the way we really won in republican-leaning districts of the state legislature was talking about the specifics of health care ... those same issues are, i believe, going to tear this party potentially apart if they don't smell the coffee. jill hanauer, project new america
it didn't have to be that way. the political landscape on health care is pretty easy to describe and it actually features more consensus than wednesday's melees conveyed. all the democrats running for president want to get to universal coverage by defending the affordable care act from republican assaults and then figuring out how to fill in its many gaps.
all of this should sound very familiar. last year, when republicans first took power, they were equally insistent about their intentions to protect people with pre-existing conditions. in reality, their proposals would have taken away existing protections without providing a comparable replacement.

parnell showcased this base-centric approach at a june 9 naacp candidate forum that norman declined to attend.
lynch is a less high-profile target. his hopes to chair the house oversight and reform committee after rep. elijah cummings (d-md.) died last october were dashed, despite serving on the committee for 18 years (he serves as a subcommittee chairman on national security). he was reluctant to get behind trump's impeachment inquiry until the allegations that trump tried to use foreign officials to investigate biden, whom lynch endorsed for president last october.

after 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day. members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
but it did, and it won't be the last time unless the u.s. health care system changes in a pretty dramatic way. this latest study shows why.
but her record isn't perfect. she has also voted to approve, or move forward on, measures that would, among other things, take away funding from planned parenthood or title x.
when the schemes do not work properly ― or, in this instance, if the insurers don't get money they are expecting ― then insurers that have enrolled sicker beneficiaries can end up with big losses, just as those with healthier beneficiaries could reap windfalls.
but any money the government would be spending on health care would largely displace money that individual americans are already spending. overall, national health care spending would probably come down slightly, according to the committee's estimate, thanks in part to lower spending on drugs once the federal government starts negotiating directly with drugmakers over what they charge.
thirty-four million have no health insurance, even more are underinsured and one insurance company executive pockets almost $500 million for a merger which will only drive health care costs higher, sanders plans to say on wednesday. please don't tell me that this is a rational health care system.
but reacting to a lower court decision in that way is a highly unusual move, nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor, told huffpost on saturday ― although he cautioned that he hadn't seen any actual filings, so he couldn't be sure exactly what the administration was thinking or doing.
and the leap worked, in large part. the aca, or obamacare, slashed the national uninsured rate to a historic low by expanding health care coverage to 20 million people who didn't have it before. some people are paying more for coverage than they were before, and plenty are unhappy with their insurance. but access to care has improved and financial distress from medical bills has declined, according to multiple studies.
[aarp] backed it and paid the price for backing it, so why not support it against repeal? said fred lynch, a professor at claremont mckenna college and author of one nation under aarp. the congress is genuinely afraid of age power, and they'd just as soon let the sleeping giant go on sleeping.
familiarizing yourself with federal election commission guidelines so that you can go right up to the edge of the law without breaking it
at this point, especially after reading trump revealed by washington post investigative reporters, i have had enough.
biden's approach would almost certainly make health care more affordable for millions. the new financial assistance, in particular, would make private insurance a lot more affordable to people who buy coverage on their own and who, because of the affordable care act's more limited subsidies, struggle to cover premiums or out-of-pocket costs.
so she wound up pumping in the store's employee training room. the law states the space must be free from intrusion, but she later said managers and co-workers walked in on her several times when her breasts were exposed ― sometimes even holding group meetings in her presence. managers told her she could use a space next to the electrical server room, but it was dirty and a sign on the door warned of danger from high voltage.
trump seemed unable to let that july 2017 vote go. months afterward he bashed the senator on twitter over the failed bill, claiming mccain let arizona down! nearly a year later, at a tennessee political rally, the president brought it up again.
republican lawmakers' massive tax plan appears to be on the cusp of legislative victory. from a public opinion standpoint, that may not be such a good thing.

the american health care act, as the republican bill that passed the house of representatives is known, repeals the two tax hikes on higher earners that the affordable care act used to fund expansion of insurance coverage: a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income and a 0.9 percent increase in the medicare hospital insurance tax. both taxes apply to individuals making $200,000 a year or more, and married couples making $250,000 a year or more.
in july, a daines spokesman told local newspapers the senator supported the justice department's decision to support the lawsuit and whatever mechanism will protect montanans from this failed law.

the walmart worker's story was among 376 investigations that huffpost obtained from the federal government through public records requests. the labor department is responsible for enforcing the nursing mothers provision of the affordable care act, better known as obamacare, which requires employers like walmart to accommodate workers who want to pump breast milk. huffpost sought any cases involving a potential violation of that law and received investigations from across the country, stretching from 2010 to 2018. the agency redacted names and identifying characteristics of workers in the files, but they provide insight into the kinds of problems new moms face while pumping on the job.
that is why lyle and administrators of other rural hospitals in texas and other non-expansion states are so adamant about their states joining the ranks of those that have expanded.
even warren's interim proposal is substantively better than pete's, he said, noting that, unlike buttigieg, warren also plans to use executive action to immediately lower prescription drug prices, including by threatening pharmaceutical patents.
this coming together highlights that, whatever disagreements there are among democrats on health care, they're ultimately unified against gop efforts to repeal obamacare with no credible alternative.
that genie is out of the bottle, dent said of the medicaid expansion. and i guess i would say to you too that we have to be careful that we don't go pulling the rug out from under people.
brett kavanaugh names his seven favorite federalist papers: 78 (judicial independence), 69 (presidency not a monarchy), 10 (factions good), 37 + 39 (the meanings of laws change over time), 47 (accumulation of power in one body is tyranny), 51 (the fallibility of men). — james hohmann (@jameshohmann) september 5, 2018
the most obvious and understood changes would affect protections for pre-existing conditions, which trump keeps insisting he and republicans are committed to preserving.
the way interior has acted under the trump administration is the textbook definition of a political cartel, using state resources to help the special interests. sen. ron wyden (d-ore.)
the reconciliation process does have its limits, however. senate rules dictate that any legislation passed through this budgetary maneuver must have a direct effect on spending or revenue, and, based on how democrats wrote the resolution, it cannot increase the deficit by more than $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years.
if you wait, you've bought the aca three years or so. and three years ain't nothing. lots can change, and the lawsuit might look even more ridiculous at that point. if you bite the bullet now, there's a really good chance the aca will be sustained. but there's a [small] risk that the case goes south.

the public option would reimburse doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care at the rate that the federal medicare program uses, inslee said.
now the issue is getting some attention again, because the medicare for all proposal from sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), which multiple democratic candidates have endorsed, allows for coverage of all residents (although the bill isn't as specific as a previous version and appears to leave the federal government discretion over how to define resident.)
covid-19 is just the most recent obstacle to women's progress, as an ineffective government response and shuttered schools threaten to push thousands of highly educated, mid-career women out of the workforce. women are nearly three times more likely to leave the workforce because of coronavirus child-care demands, according to census bureau surveys. and it's not clear when they can get back to work.
trump spurned former vice president joe biden as a dumb person he hopes to run against in the 2020 presidential election.
a lot depends on whether external political events, like the upcoming special house elections in georgia and montana, change the political calculus of republicans ― so many of whom seem convinced that the political cost of doing nothing is worse than the political cost of doing something that appears to be highly unpopular.
without a firm answer, democrats will likely turn to the nominee's past rulings and writings, and, of course, trump's own tweets. in 2015, when the supreme court upheld the affordable care act ― thanks to votes from chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy, who is retiring ― trump promised he would choose only people who would strike down the law.
with the possibility of obtaining and then holding these plans for up to three years ― and with no mandate steering people toward more comprehensive coverage ― more people will be able to use these policies as their ongoing source of health insurance. if the official and unofficial projections are right, as many as several million people could do just that.
in those 14 states that refused the medicaid expansion ― and in nebraska for the time being ― 2 million low-income adults without children at home likely qualify for nothing.
last year, the average cost of job-based health benefits for a single person was almost $600 a month and more than $1,700 for family coverage, according to a kaiser family foundation survey. employers cover an average of almost 80% of that premium for single workers and 70% of it for family coverage. but once you're on cobra, that gets significantly more expensive.
the economy grew by 2.1% last year and congress spent much of the past decade reversing agency spending cuts imposed by a failed 2011 budget pact.

the very fact that this campaign exists is evidence that idaho's government isn't working the way it should, said pat tucker, who is trying her hand at elected politics by running for a local state house seat. people are frustrated, she said. people are feeling personally the consequences of not being represented, of not being heard, in their own lives.
all told, parnell's campaign is a far cry from the platforms of the mostly extinct conservative southern democrats who made a point of thumbing their noses at the party on key priorities.
the bill had bipartisan support, with only small factions of liberals and libertarians opposing it, as well as the backing of u.s. intelligence agencies – all of which are now under trump's control. trump nevertheless started tweeting against it, requiring an emergency intervention by kelly and house speaker ryan to explain the bill to him and persuade him to write a follow-up tweet reversing his opposition.
that is why the justice department created such a stir last june when it made the unusual decision not to defend the law in court.
there's abundant evidence, for example, that when health insurers merge, premiums rise. researchers found, for example, that after aetna merged with prudential healthcare in 1999, premiums rose 7 percent higher than had the merger not occurred.
a core goal of the aca has been to make sure that people with serious medical problems have the same access to insurance policies, at the same prices, as those who are in relatively good health. it does so by prohibiting insurers from denying policies or charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions ― and by establishing a basic set of essential health benefits that all plans must include.
swensen said the medical center gave $322 million in financial assistance and charity care in fiscal 2018. but legal and finance experts said that's not a reliable estimate.
the plaintiffs, who are republican attorneys general representing 18 states, say that eliminating the fine turned the mandate into a coercive command ― and that, as a result, all of obamacare has to go. the trump administration is backing their lawsuit.
on the bright side, handler got a new diagnosis soon after for a benign condition and didn't need surgery. on the other hand, she's been fighting her insurance company and the exchange pretty much since then.
still, there's little indication that barrett backs policies that would support such women, especially because such policies include access to birth control.

senior researcher doug weber contributed to this report.
trump boasts about having vanquished the terrorist group isis, even though his generals essentially continued the offensive in syria and iraq started by the military under obama several years ago. he brags about the the economy and the number of jobs he has created, even though the economy has followed roughly the same trajectory it was on under obama (the number of jobs added in 2017 was actually lower than the number created in 2016). trump even claimed credit for the lack of any fatal commercial airline accidents worldwide last year – a circumstance he had nothing to do with.
the legal actions were against christian healthcare ministries and medi-share.
our approach is based on principled realism ― not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel ― and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem.
some of the 2020 candidates are proposing medicare for all. some are proposing a public option. and it's not clear how many voters actually understand the two concepts, the differences between them or the trade-offs they entail.
should it get to that point, there is a possibility that some of the medicaid expansion may be restored, albeit in a reduced size and scope (think: coverage for those up to 80 or 100 percent of the poverty line, rather than 133.). but while that might attract democratic votes, it wouldn't be a simple legislative gambit. lawmakers would need to find a way to pay for it. and keeping items like the reductions in medicare spending and some of the affordable care act's tax hikes would prove to be far less politically popular.
braun won the primary with the help of millions of dollars worth of television ads boosting his name recognition. he paid for those ads with his own money — something he reportedly said he wouldn't do in the general election.

the danger is that not all institutions would ― or could ― react this way.
when congress wrote the affordable care act back in 2010, it created an individual mandate that required people to pay a fine if they didn't get health insurance.
it's unclear whether these proposals will have much bipartisan support. republicans have shown little appetite to negotiate on another relief package. the trump administration decided against reopening the obamacare exchanges during the early days of the pandemic in march, and despite promising to cover health care costs for uninsured americans through a hospital fund, the administration has yet to set up a system to do so.
eligibility for programs such as nutrition assistance and medicaid is linked to the poverty thresholds, so holding down the official poverty line would slow the growth of enrollment in those programs, since fewer people would qualify as average incomes outpace the slower inflation measure.
folks, if you're wondering what to do now that comey has testified: defcon 5 on trumpcare. all hands on deck. timeline & how to fight: 1/ — ben wikler (@benwikler) june 8, 2017
there were comparisons to the fantastically vain talk-show host joan callamezzo from parks and recreation ...
the numbers bear this out. the number of people buying insurance on their own, rather than through employers, has started to fall, as a recent report from the henry j. kaiser family foundation confirmed. the decline is mostly among people who face those high premiums because they don't qualify for subsidies.
the political landscape on health care is pretty easy to describe and it actually features more consensus than wednesday's melees conveyed.
trump didn't use the term association health plans in his remarks, but he did repeatedly praise alexander acosta, the secretary of labor, whose department published the regulations governing these policies last month, so it's clear what trump is referring to.
and that is where the lawsuit ought to fall apart, in the opinion of virtually every expert who has spoken out on the case, because congress made its intentions clear a year ago when it passed that tax cut. at that time, lawmakers understood that the rest of the law would stay in place even if they removed the penalty. they voted yes anyway.
that's hard for me to answer, peters said in a quick phone call sunday after a campaign stop in waterford, michigan, noting it's not unusual for voters to tune in to an election late, let alone in a pandemic. michigan is a complicated place.
under the new rules, bars are limited to takeout and delivery only, rafting and tubing businesses must close, restaurants are limited to 50% capacity, and outdoor gatherings of 100 or more people require local government approval.
taking away food assistance to punish parents who are behind on their child support payments, or who haven't filed a child support case, makes those parents less capable of providing financial support to their children, neal and davis said.
flexibility is one thing, but when it comes with fewer dollars, that constrains the ability of states to provide coverage and adequate financial protection for hospitals, levitt said. and with fewer people able to afford insurance, such hospitals would likely face greater uncompensated expenses treating people who can't pay.
but they don't, and they won't, because they support the lawsuit. they support repealing the aca. and they support fewer protections for people with preexisting conditions.
now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis, it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home.
special interests have special interests, and i stand up to them, baldwin said, on why she's facing so much conservative spending. it sometimes defies the imagination how much change we've seen with regard to spending on campaigns.
warren's plan would use executive authority to drive down drug prices and push congress to pass a narrower piece of legislation, one that improved the financial assistance available through the affordable care act and created a government plan open to anybody who wanted to join it.
kentucky's proposal is likely to prompt legal challenges. if it survives, then the result will almost certainly be a smaller medicaid program. both the state and the federal government would likely end up spending less money than they would otherwise. but fewer people would be on medicaid: the number of beneficiaries would drop by roughly 95,000 within five years, according to official state estimates.
jen bendery here's a framed photo in murkowski's office of the senator holding walter right after she caught him.
democratic governors from medicaid-expansion states have also been in touch with their congressional delegations in hopes of convincing them to pump the brakes on aca repeal.
if senators are able to pass their own bill, while simultaneously demonstrating that the house bill doesn't have the votes to pass in their chamber, ryan will be left with the choice of either putting the senate bill up for a vote and angering conservatives or holding strong. if he holds strong and doesn't put the senate-passed measure up for a vote, he could risk another shutdown and strengthen the democrats' argument that another government closure is the fault of republican obstructionism.
as the republican national convention concluded last thursday with a marathon acceptance speech by the president, gaffigan spent an hour firing off tweets aimed at trump supporters. he urged voters to wake up and call out trump for the con man and thief that he is.
the compromise that emerged was said to be a take-it-or-leave-it final offer from the white house that would let conservatives eliminate certain essential benefits from insurance requirements, such as maternity care and mental illness treatment. to appease moderates concerned too many people will be tossed from the health insurance rolls, the deal includes keeping a 0.9 percent medicare surcharge tax from the affordable care act on high-income earners for six years. that would add about $15 billion to a fund to help states defray costs.
so, how many is 14 million people?
sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) grilled kavanaugh on what he knew about the republican staff members who hacked into democrats' computers to monitor strategy memos in 2002 and 2003. the hack became public in 2004, and included leahy's files. implicated in the scandal was manny miranda, an aide to then-senate majority leader bill frist (r-tenn.). miranda resigned under pressure from democrats.
it's an issue barzee flores has been hitting him on hard, and she'll no doubt focus in on it more intensely in the closing days of the campaign, after this weekend's pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting.
this is not a promise he or the republicans are going to keep.
president barack obama signed the affordable care act into law on march 23, 2010 ― eight years ago friday. but this anniversary feels different from the ones that came before it.
i believe that we as a country innovate in entirely the wrong way when it comes to health care. and the reason i say this is because the vast majority of venture capital investors and private equity investors are 35-year-old white guys. and that's why we have 14 fitbits and investing in things like artificial intelligence and all these high-end things that people who are really not in great need of care ― i mean, people who generally are getting good care ― are getting all kinds of innovations.
sixty million americans contracted the swine flu, pence said. [biden's] own chief of staff ron klain would say last year that it was pure luck, that they did 'everything possible wrong.' and we learned from that. (klain later told politico his comments referred to the white house's struggle to produce an adequate supply of vaccines to meet public demand.)
more trump voters said they were loyal to president donald trump than they were to the republican party, according to a new huffpost/yougov poll.
asked how leaders could fulfill the freedom caucus requirement of removing the medicaid expansion and still please moderates who want to preserve it, rep. greg walden (r-ore.), the chairman of the house committee with jurisdiction over medicaid, told huffpost on wednesday that he thought republicans would be able to write a bill that accomplishes more than the 2015 repeal bill and would actually get to entitlement reform of medicaid.
nichols, lm et al. are market forces strong enough to deliver efficient health care systems? confidence is waning. health aff (millwood) 23 (2): 8-21, 2004.
the finding, which comes from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, is not exactly a revelation. over the past few years, there's been no shortage of studies on people forgoing medical care because it's too expensive, just as there's been no shortage of stories about people suffering as a result.
earlier, in florida, the president derided the bidens as an organized crime family, renewing his daily claims about the candidate's son, hunter, and his business dealings in ukraine and china.
dunned some former patients an additional 15% for legal costs, plus 6% interest on their unpaid bills, which over years can add up to more than the original bill.
still, trump may be the most brazen of all. in addition to issuing regulations that would undermine the affordable care act's provisions, he has directed his justice department to support a lawsuit that would declare the law unconstitutional.
there are several other possibilities. the court could, for example, hear the case, be headed for a 4-4 tie and call for a rehearing with nine justices so that it could deliver a more definitive ruling. roberts could also push it back on the schedule.
we eventually did get davidson to admit the gop bill wouldn't have addressed pre-existing conditions the same way as the affordable care act, but he still downplayed the differences. it's not as different as a lot of people want to make it. it's really not that big of a change, davidson said.
of course, defeating the gag rule needs more than just collins and murkowski. aside from planned parenthood, there are now eight states now saying they will no longer accept the federal funds.
early on in the race, grayson was beating murphy by a wide margin. but murphy overtook him in march, soon after the house's ethics committee announced it was reviewing grayson's management of a cayman islands hedge fund while in office. though the ethics panel hasn't yet opened a formal investigation, a report by the separate office of congressional ethics found as many as a half dozen violations of house rules, grayson contends the report was aimed at aiding murphy's campaign.

but pelosi didn't say the $1,000 bonuses are crumbs to workers. republicans are shifting the context of her statement from the grand scheme of a trillion dollar tax cut to the more modest setting of individual workers' paychecks.
their big allure will be their upfront cost. because short-term plans leave out key benefits and because insurers can exclude people who already have serious medical problems, the policies usually have much lower premiums than plans with comprehensive coverage.
durbin questioned a harsh 2017 dissent kavanaugh authored that criticized the d.c. circuit court's decision to quickly allow a pregnant, undocumented teenager in texas access to an abortion. kavanaugh defended his opinion because a minor was involved and it was proper for her to first consult with an immigration sponsor, which can be a family member or friend.
everybody has a teacher they can look back on. and those people decided that this drumbeat of denigrating and attacking teachers wasn't going to fly. david patterson, kentucky education association
still, the arguments were basically the same as before, with sanders talking about how medicare for all would cover everybody, with no out-of-pocket costs, and biden warning that it would mean forcing people who like employer coverage to give it up.
when i bring up that there's a lot about hillary's claims of being a progressive that i don't trust, i've been accused by hillary supporters of being duped by republicans' decades-long propaganda campaign of character assassination against her. however, if you look at my list, you'll notice that whitewater, benghazi, and hillary's personal email server aren't there. that's because, as a liberal, i've always known that those scandals were nothing more than cynical political fishing expeditions invented by republicans to tarnish hillary's image. so i don't hold them against her.
on tuesday, trump suggested in a tweet that he actually thinks ruining medical coverage for uninsured americans is a good thing.
conservative christian opponents of planned parenthood have long sought to defund it because its centers perform abortions.
his own justice department admitted months later in a court filing that there was no basis for trump's claim.
mccain's rebuttals were generally measured, in contrast to the president's brash rhetorical style.
climate change and health care are his top priorities in this election. a few years ago, stevenson started genesis energy development, which provides solar energy alternatives for electronic devices. he hopes to work with historically black colleges across the country to install his charging stations.
in 2017, brown and cliff albright founded black voters matter fund, which made headlines during the 2018 midterms for its voter mobilization tactics. in an effort to empower south carolina's black voters, the founders organized a bus tour throughout the state, hitting rural black communities candidates often miss. their mission is to promote effective voting by increasing voter registration and turnout and knocking down barriers that often cause voter suppression.
supporters, including gop leaders in the legislature, say the new requirement and reporting regimen will encourage people to find jobs ― and that, more fundamentally, it's wrong to demand taxpayers subsidize health care for people who could find employment but don't.
they want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. not going to happen. it's their responsibility, plain and simple, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said at a press conference following the meeting with the president.
and the republicans, as toxic as they wanna be, were hellbent on stopping everything president obama tried to do, even if it meant hurting economically their own white working-class and middle-class base. they could simply blame the struggles of those white sisters and brothers on obama, obamacare, mexicans, immigrants, black people, muslims, anyone and anything that was—and is—an easy target.
i'm as busy this year as i was at any time last year in the heat of a huge election, said mark fraley, chairman of the monroe county democratic party in indiana.
somebody has finally put some numbers on what the republican effort to undermine obamacare will mean for everyday americans.

tell us what you think, is bush making a desperate swipe at trump? or is the conspiracy real? comment below. for the both of us, we will have to wait until the republican national convention in cleveland, july 21, 2016.
it's a series of talking points that trump and his surrogates have tried to use against biden before to little effect.
the former reality tv host who improbably became the leader of the free world has unquestionably earned superlatives, although likely not the ones he and his fans had hoped: on the anniversary of his inauguration, trump is the least-liked president in modern history, at this point in his term. strong majorities of americans find him dishonest, uninformed and temperamentally unfit for the job. abroad, the united states' standing has plummeted in the past year, to the point where china is seen as a better world leader.
these short-term plans offer significant savings on a monthly basis compared to the comprehensive insurance sold on the exchanges. but that lower price comes with big financial risks.
last year, kenny's insurance company directed him to a public clinic for a physical and some blood work. what he didn't notice was that a private lab company had a contract with the clinic ― and that lab wasn't in his plan's network. he got a bill for $600.
i can only speak to the fact that the berners i know are amongst the most kind, generous, caring, thoughtful, and compassionate of all my friends -- and the most fired up ones are women, not mythical bernie bros. however, i will definitely admit that berners seem to be way more passionate, vocal, and motivated than the hillary supporters i know who, with only one or two exceptions, are a curiously quiet bunch. it doesn't surprise me that emotions tend to run higher on the bernie side -- after all, bernie is calling for a revolution. i wouldn't characterize any of my berner friends as mean, nor do i think it's mean to point out a candidate's flaws, inconsistencies, and what you don't like about their record and platform. if you find your berner friends to actually be mean, maybe that says more about the quality of your friends than the character of all berners. and if hillary supporters are referring to the meanness of anonymous bernie fans on the internet, it's well known that being able to say whatever you want while hiding your identity has made the comment sections of the internet pretty cruel places.
he also secured dentistry for poor pregnant women, prenatal counseling programs and initiatives targeting heart disease, all on the federal dime. these were patchwork programs, only available in kentucky. but no principled opponent of government health care could approve of them.
but as dishonest as these republican attacks have been, hillary supporters must accept the fact that they've been effective on a huge percentage of american voters, particularly ones who aren't politically-aware liberals. this includes democrats, republicans, and independents, especially ones who don't follow the news closely but have seen the headlines about various clinton-related investigations for years. because of this, hillary is largely seen as untrustworthy by voters across the political spectrum, earning her sky-high disapproval ratings that would make her the most unliked democratic nominee in recent history. yes, that's unfair and largely undeserved, but that doesn't stop it from being true -- and it makes her a real liability if your #1 priority is stopping republicans from winning the 2016 election.
who will suffer the most when they ration care? the sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. the america i know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with down's syndrome will have to stand in front of obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. such a system is downright evil. (1)
this is how it worked before the affordable care act for those who don't get health benefits from a large employer or a government program like medicare.
of course, moulton's nonideology is itself an ideology. he is is a member of the pro-business, fiscally moderate new democrat coalition.
the gop's latest gambit is this lawsuit, brought by texas attorney general ken paxton (r) and other state officials and supported by the trump administration. the plaintiffs seek to eliminate every word of the aca. because the federal government unusually decided not to defend a federal law, california attorney general xavier becerra and other democratic state attorneys general are acting in defense. this is the third time a gop lawsuit to kill obamacare has reached the supreme court; the others failed.
if the cnn obamacare debate between senators ted cruz and bernie sanders taught us one thing, it is that both participants come from very different philosophical points of view, are deeply passionate about what they believe and don't let the facts get in the way of their positions. in the hairsplitting department, sanders believes that health care is a right, equal to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, while cruz believes all americans deserve access to health care, which is not the same as actually having health care.
in a 2014 supreme court decision involving christian-owned craft store chain hobby lobby stores inc, the court said that privately held companies could bring objections to the contraception mandate on religious grounds.
so the record business trump has already touted may be a while coming, if anyone ever buys one of these plans at all.
washington ― nevada gov. brian sandoval (r) warned congress on wednesday about the consequences of repealing the affordable care act without an adequate replacement for millions of people insured under the law.
abc news host george stephanopoulos pushed back, noting obamacare already protects americans like blaque.
experts agree that job losses during the pandemic have led to more uninsured people, but it's unclear how many more. some estimates range from 5 million to 10 million, while the congressional budget office suggests a lower number, more like 3 million.
antonin scalia died on saturday. donald trump went into full attack mode in the debate that night. still, the scalia story continued. would anyone have been surprised if mr. trump tweeted long ago, even before justice roberts approved obamacare twice, i predicted that scalia would die someday and create a divisive vacancy?
in other words, the american health care act 2.0 as legislation is all smoke and mirrors. debates behind closed doors and the resultant uncertainty over insurance regulations, cost-sharing programs, reinsurance payments, and level and nature of the subsidies for consumers to purchase insurance alone will push insurers out of the market and collapse certain state exchanges.
i traveled all over the country to fight the repeal of obamacare.
our record-breaking fundraising is a clear reflection of the urgency that people have towards fighting back against a reckless republican agenda, including ongoing efforts to rip apart the affordable care act, dccc spokesman tyler law said in a press release. the massive amount of small-dollar, online donations – much of which came from first time donors – provides another clear sign that the grassroots energy is behind house democrats this cycle.
in this world, skin color is a category that shapes your experience, says nelson, who is one of the four black researchers at the helm of a recent study that, promisingly, has had initial success supporting prep uptake and adherence among african-american msm. when you don't have diversity on your scientific team, those kinds of experiences are never brought to the table to form study designs, what questions you can ask, how questions get asked.
new york, april 1 (reuters) - two republican state attorneys general on monday urged a federal appeals court to uphold the obamacare federal healthcare law, saying that striking it down would be disruptive for patients, doctors, insurers and employers.
it's commendable for an agency to seek expert opinion on policy, said jeffrey lubbers, an expert on administrative law and regulation at american university's washington college of law. but it won't necessarily protect the agency from a lawsuit arguing that the change was not supportable by the facts and was therefore arbitrary and capricious, lubbers said.
gross cites sullivan's reticence about the mining project as a key example of his refusal to put alaska above partisanship or corporate interests. dan sullivan has had more than six years to speak out against the mine, representing the state, and he's been in the shadows while the trump administration has moved forward on the mine, he said.
they say that's because the program is fundamentally broken. it's the same argument trump makes. but michigan is one of the states that prove otherwise ― that obamacare can work, especially if public officials will support it.
so, to be clear, this is not an organization that is about assembling people from all points of view and siphoning out the lowest common denominator of ideas. this is about a commitment to putting the tangible ideas behind the passion that americans have for health care and trying to get policies changed.
trump this week suggested that his administration supports some amount of direct federal spending, telling the new york times magazine his administration was going to prime the pump to get the economy going. but his preliminary budget, which the white house released earlier this month, delivered the opposite message. it proposed a 13 percent reduction to the budget of the department of transportation, including slashing funds to the successful tiger grant program, which has been used to fund highway, rail, and transit projects.
the affordable care act is law because obama decided to test the boundaries of the politically possible for the sake of what he believed could be a once-in-a-generation achievement. a key question about biden is whether, as a president facing similar circumstances, he would do the same.
this year, america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america's mission, and the power of american pride.

and new mexico committed to pursuing a transition from coal to renewable energy by passing the energy transition act. energy, minerals and natural resources department secretary sarah cottrell propst called the measure the strongest package of its kind in the country.
private insurers are taking similar steps, fox said, and the blue cross blue shield association report emphasizes the importance of programs that encourage patients to keep track of their medical conditions.
and on cbs's face the nation sunday, ryan admitted he actually has no idea how many people will lose coverage.
meadows reported thursday night that, while he was still leaning no, there are a number of conservative wins in the new legislation, including the elimination of essential health benefits that require insurers to cover basic health care services. there also were certain assurances that the president and his staff made that could persuade conservatives, he added, though he wouldn't elaborate.

yes, i am. i am hosting something for [randy bryce, an ironworker who seeks to challenge ryan in his wisconsin house district this november] at my house shortly. i just wrote a letter for [senate candidate beto o'rourke] in texas. i just wrote a letter for a candidate in georgia.
quist struggled with medical debt for years after the surgery, which was botched and left him unable to afford insurance for a time due to a pre-existing condition. he has said that he supports single-payer health insurance because he does not want people to go bankrupt trying to pay for health care.
several democrats, including sen. bob menendez (d-n.j.) and rep. ted lieu (d-calif.), gloated about the victory on social media. but many democrats chose not to celebrate the moment, and several encouraged their followers not to rest on their laurels.
the latest legal assault on the affordable care act is downright laughable, but the consequences would be deadly serious if it succeeded.
if i could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars, now seeing in the aftermath of how quickly the coronavirus spread in the bar setting, abbott told kvia in el paso.
we don't want to own it politically. they own it right now, trump said.
when the administration announced its intent to support the lawsuit, a group of democratic state officials led by xavier becerra, attorney general of california, stepped in to oppose the lawsuit. and after democrats took control of the u.s. house early this year, one of their first moves was to pass a resolution allowing leaders to file a brief joining the defense, as they have since done.
the biggest fireworks during wednesday's 13-hour proceedings came during exchanges with democratic sens. patrick leahy of vermont, kamala harris of california and booker. all three questioned kavanaugh by alluding to emails and other material about the nominee's record that had not been made available to the public. the senators created moments of unexpected drama, but, at least for the moment, failed to land a knockout blow.
the number of people without insurance would fall, so that coverage would approach universal levels, and even people with employer-sponsored coverage would have access to more generous benefits.
the second television ad of donnelly's campaign, released before trump's visit, has the candidate positioning himself as a bridge between the far left and the far right to pass laws combating military suicides and working with then-gov. mike pence to expand health care in the state.
it's an audacious, politically controversial idea that got little attention in mainstream politics until sanders made it a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign. it's since become a rallying cry for democratic party progressives and, on wednesday, sanders introduced a newly updated version of his legislation, which 14 democratic senators, including four fellow presidential candidates, endorse.
where harris, biden and sanders stand on health care
mcgrath is now running a high-profile — albeit extremely long shot — bid against senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r), and hicks ― a marine veteran, former police officer and lawyer ― may benefit from an extremely energized democratic base in kentucky.
obama regularly talks about his relationship with his daughters, malia and sasha, and the importance of his role as a father. bravo argues that by doing so, obama has made parenthood an issue of national importance. she pointed specifically to obama sharing how his daughters had reshaped his views on marriage equality.
the existing tax break for group policies makes a dollar of benefits worth more than a dollar of income. and company benefits are a way to attract and retain employees, especially the higher-wage workers that companies often compete to hire.
because so many people would remain in private insurance plans, some of those with serious medical problems would have trouble getting treatment because they would have to overcome private insurance refusals to cover certain therapies.
a moderate democrat winning any seat in a congressional race in south carolina is nothing to sneeze at. i would canvass for a ham sandwich to keep ralph norman out of congress, said horne, a co-founder of the organization #dementer, which is trying to move the democratic party to the left by getting progressives into leadership positions.
this time, she had to hold off her own insurgent challenger. booker, a freshman state legislator from louisville, emerged as a real contender in the primary after taking a leading role in racial justice protests that broke out in his hometown and across kentucky. those demonstrations highlighted the march police killing of breonna taylor, a black woman in louisville.
short-term coverage can be a hazard for consumers
what's very different is that it's made the party younger. young people never really wanted to have as much of a meaningful part in the democratic party infrastructure. now that doesn't seem true anymore, he said.
one worry is that because of the pre-existing exclusions and benefits structure, ministries disproportionately attract and retain people in relatively good health, leaving the traditional insurance market with a relatively sicker group of customers. this drives up costs for insurers offering traditional plans, forcing them to jack up premiums.
another fear about easing up on hospital cuts is more about politics than policy. if hospital administrators had more time to adjust to cuts, then hospital lobbyists would have more time to persuade lawmakers to delay or cancel implementation.
to be sure, the political climate was different in the mid-1980s. tax reform had been percolating in congress for years, and in 1982 democratic sen. bill bradley of new jersey and rep. richard gephardt of missouri sponsored a bill that proposed to close loopholes for the rich and cut marginal tax rates for all income brackets. though that measure never made it to a vote, president ronald reagan, in his state of the union address in january 1984, pledged to reform the tax code. the following year, reagan reiterated his pledge and democrats thought it wise to join in.
during his presidency, trump has broadened access to insurance policies that don't meet the aca's standards for essential benefits and can reject people with preexisting conditions or at least charge them more, such as short-term plans and association health plans, and he has encouraged states to adopt similar policies.
the massive digital ad buy through the steyer-backed group nextgen america will target voters ages 18 to 35 in 11 states: california, nevada, arizona, iowa, wisconsin, michigan, new hampshire, pennsylvania, virginia, north carolina and florida.
the case is based on a clever argument that sounds good at first but that unravels when you dig into it, jonathan adler, a case western university law professor, told huffpost in an email.
individuals and families covered by employers' healthcare plans typically have to choose between a ppo, which includes a choice of physicians, and an hmo-type plan which may limit choice. they may further have the option of a high-deductible plan combined with a health savings account.
the mandate compelled healthy people to buy insurance to offset sicker patients' costs after obamacare barred insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
sen. mike lee (r-utah), who wrote a book about the constitution, had a lengthy exchange about kavanaugh's views on the constitution and the federalist papers. lee asked which of the federalist papers is the nominee's favorite. when kavanaugh named several, lee suggested that spotify should put them into a playlist of greatest hits.
according to a line in the show's theme song (the fifth line, to be exact), where precisely was the title character born and raised on the tv series the fresh prince of bel-air? (west philadelphia)
similarly, a single person making $30,000 a year would pay $85 a month for a standard plan instead of the current $195.
here are three more takeaways from thursday's debate:
the republican primary, featuring former sheriff joe arpaio, rep. martha mcsally and former state sen. kelli ward, could be more interesting. arpaio and ward are splitting the conservative vote, which will most likely allow the more moderate mcsally to win.
ernst, an anti-abortion senator who is seeking her second term this year, joined 38 of her republican senate colleagues in january in asking the supreme court to revisit and potentially overturn roe, which protects the right to abortion. the friend of the court brief was also signed by 168 house members.
there are some issues with california's existing law: job protections are limited. many employers still have leeway to fire workers who take leave ― a limitation that activists hope newsom will address.
some will win, some will lose, some will lose big
chaffetz ― a fresh-faced, calmly spoken 49-year-old who was a placekicker for brigham young university in the late '80s ― was one of president barack obama's most outspoken critics. he won the oversight committee's chairmanship in late 2014 by promising aggressive investigations but also a more bipartisan approach than the deeply politicized style of his predecessor, darrell issa (r-calif.).

and because the tax credits are available on a sliding scale, relative to income, even some people eligible for assistance struggle with either premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both.
nine months after the bill's passage, and with nothing at stake, ryan held that kumbaya moment. and there's a basic reason why someone like pfeifer would not be impressed. for first responders, remembering 9/11 is not just about honoring that terrible day and their losses and sacrifices. it's also about why they were willing to sacrifice in the first place, and why nearly all of them would do it again, regardless of the cost. it's a day that shows in the clearest way what good people do when others are in desperate need: they act, especially if it's their job.
the individual mandate (and the fines taxpayers owe if they aren't covered and don't qualify for an exemption) is the least popular part of the affordable care act, especially among republicans. but it's also vital for keeping the exchanges operating, because it pushes people with less medical need into the insurance pool, where their premiums offset the costs of treating sicker people.
an appellate ruling declaring obamacare unconstitutional could prompt an appeal to the u.s. supreme court, opening the door for the top court to take up the issue in the midst of the 2020 u.s. presidential election.
a summary of this package of legislation provided by pelosi's office shows that it isn't as sweeping or comprehensive as proposals favored by progressives to replace the current private health insurance system with a government-funded single-payer program and that it doesn't include any form of public option plan that would compete with private insurance. but it does seek to address some of the affordable care act's main shortcomings.
this year's maintenance outage schedule is reportedly the same as last year's: 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. every sunday, except for the last sunday, during the sign-up period. the total scheduled downtime this year ― as it was last year ― is 60 hours.

the senator emphasized that there is a process in place to overturn a precedent. the nominee agreed.
daniel jorjani, a political appointee at the interior department who once told colleagues that our job is to protect the secretary from ethics probes and bad press, will appear before a senate committee thursday to make his case for a promotion to be the agency's top lawyer.
we always know you're never going to win a coverage beauty contest when it's free market versus government mandates. if the government says thou shall buy our health insurance, the government estimates are going to say people will comply and it will happen, he said. and when you replace that with we're going to have a free market, and you buy what you want to buy, they're going to say not nearly as many people are going to do that. that's just going to happen. and so you'll have those coverage estimates. we assume that's going to happen. that's not our goal.
alex wong via getty images sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) speaks at a march 21 news conference on capitol hill to discuss republican legislative proposals on health insurance premiums.
harrisburg, pa. -- by the time donald trump was scheduled to take the stage on thursday night, the wait to get through the metal detectors and into the indoor arena was still several thousand people deep.
if this president is reelected, we know what will happen. cases and deaths will remain far too high, biden said in an emotional speech accepting his party's nomination from wilmington, delaware.
and anybody unfamiliar with that saga could simply have paid attention this week, when the trump administration announced a major reinterpretation of the affordable care act's insurance rules. the change means that states can undermine some of the law's key provisions that help people with serious medical problems.
this is where we have been headed for almost eight years and you have the gop to thank for all of this.
i am not hostile to the aca. … i apply the law, i follow the law, barrett said, stressing that she had not had conversations with anyone in the white house about the case.

no survey can predict with certainty how a debate over any specific health care plan would actually play out, especially with such a debate at least two years away. but polls can reveal a lot about voter hopes and fears. democrats won't succeed at passing legislation unless they are ready for both.
it's time to offer more affordable coverage options, seema verma, administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, said during a conference call tuesday. it's about allowing individuals, not the government, to make decisions about what works for them and their families.
a: there are always trade-offs. the public option plans out there envision some people continuing to carry significant out-of-pocket costs or facing substantial premiums. it'd be a marked improvement over the status quo, but you'd still have some people with high medical bills.
during a debate on montana pbs on monday night, daines suggested the supreme court justices would not actually overturn the law known as obamacare.
congressional gop leaders already are embroiled in a major struggle to get rank-and-file lawmakers to embrace the legislation. a negative cbo score could make their goal of passing a health care reform bill in the house and senate and sending it to trump's desk by mid-april even more difficult.
i would anticipate that everybody will practice good hygiene, social distancing, whatever is appropriate, cramer told reporters.

everyone faces choices. medicare recipients know that basic coverage is simple, though the monthly premium depends on their income. but they must also choose a supplement plan and a part d prescription drug plan.
roddy added that while he was in dire need of a vacation, the extended trip was not about giving himself an extra day of rest and relaxation.
medicaid and the children's health insurance program
booker's late surge in the race pushed him to the lead among kentuckians who cast ballots in person on election day. he won those voters by 65 percentage points in louisville and 50 points in lexington, the state's two largest cities. but mcgrath's advantage with mail-in votes, which made up roughly three-quarters of the ballots cast in the race, earned her the victory. booker's final margin of victory in lexington, for example, shrank to roughly 6 percentage points, and absentee ballots swung many of kentucky's rural counties sharply in mcgrath's favor.
the lack of progress has been especially apparent in the great lakes region that helped deliver the presidency to trump. even as manufacturing jobs grew modestly in other parts of the country in 2019, employment from that sector declined by 0.5% in pennsylvania, ohio, michigan and wisconsin, according to a september report by the century foundation, a liberal think tank.
washington — when former special counsel robert mueller testifies on wednesday, many house democrats hope it will be the moment of reckoning they expected from the initial report itself.
this year, aided by a wave of high-profile endorsements that included sens. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), bernie sanders (i-vt.) and kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) and several progressive house members, newman prevailed over lipinski in the rematch by about 2,400 votes.
arguments in the case before the high court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by trump, are likely to be in april with a ruling due by the end of june.
in his chat with brody, pence pointed specifically to the chief justice being the swing vote in a june ruling that struck down a louisiana law that could have left the state with only one abortion provider. the law would have mandated that doctors providing abortions obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital ― a requirement that the court had rejected four years earlier in a texas case.
nominating barrett to the supreme court is also part of a longtime republican goal of having a woman overturn roe v. wade. it's helpful for optics, said lawless, who pointed out that president george w. bush passed restrictions on abortion while surrounded by smiling white men.
smith said grayson's attacks on republican opponents to obamacare struck a chord, citing grayson's widely-reported jab: if you do get sick, america, the republican healthcare plan is this: 'die quickly.'
the event, co-hosted by the religious coalition for reproductive choice, included interfaith blessings, prayers, and testimonies about why it was important ― politically and spiritually ― for women to have autonomy over their own bodies.

this district includes the city of hialeah, which is the no. 1 city for affordable care sign-up, barzee flores noted. so this guy isn't acting in the best interests of his constituents on guns, the environment or even immigration.
today's republicans didn't invent griping about the cbo ― democrats certainly did their fair share when writing the affordable care act in 2009 and 2010.
as far as replacement plans go, the same lawmakers have been stuck in an endless cycle of proposing bills (always with the same components ― health savings accounts, buying insurance across state lines, tort reform), sending those bills to committee to die, chafing at criticism that their alternative plan doesn't exist, and rebooting the process anew. on this issue, congressional republicans have always desperately wanted someone else to call the shots. they live to be led ― and the intermittent messages from trump's twitter account is as good at filling that role as anything else.
one goal of risk adjustment is to make those strategies less attractive, because insurers who utilize them will have to give back at least some, if not all, of the extra money the efforts bring them. eventually, in an ideal world, insurers would end up competing more on the basis of their quality of coverage ― and less on their ability to mine actuarial data and manipulate plan design.
the pattern hasn't held completely in the supreme court, however. two major challenges have come before it already and both failed, with chief justice john roberts, a republican appointee, joining the four democratic appointees each time and former justice anthony kennedy, also a republican appointee, joining them on the second of the two cases.
on the anti-obamacare side, the american action network is running the greatest number of ads ― and spending the most money ($1,253,700) ― this cycle, according to the data compiled by kantar media/cmag for huffpost. on the pro-obamacare side, the group save my care has the highest number of spots, while j.b. pritzker, who just won illinois' democratic gubernatorial primary, has spent the most money ($2,173,010).
i grant [republicans] their position on abortion, pelosi said. but contraception? contraception, contraception, really? i know we're talking about mosquitoes, but do we need to talk about the birds and the bees at the same time?
trump just needs to end his mission to destroy the entire legislation.
so i absolutely believe that we ought to be productively trying to solve those problems. i do believe there is a role to play for innovative people, and there are young companies, innovative millennials that are trying to solve these problems. i think that's a good thing.
and how many children alone have been slaughtered like pigs by automatic gunfire during the last 7 plus years? and what did your gophuck yourself congress do?
trump's proposal is, then, a statement of values, as democrats say.
those injections would cost $16,000 each if they didn't have insurance, julie buckholt said, an amount beyond the reach of nearly all americans. as a high-cost patient with a serious chronic illness, she's among those americans who have benefited from the aca's prohibition against insurance companies setting hard-dollar caps on how many bills they will pay over the course of a year or a lifetime.
trump's opponent sen. ted cruz (r-texas) has been attacking the business mogul for supporting government-run health insurance, comparing it to obamacare. trump said cruz was a total liar and that he strongly opposes obamacare.
pepin county and other rural areas in the western part of wisconsin may not seem like fertile land for one of the senate's most liberal members. but they're key to baldwin's re-election strategy this year.

none of it means anything if the energy doesn't become power, if it doesn't translate into electoral success. one major test of how potent the new movement is will come on saturday, when delaware holds a special election for a vacated state senate seat. whichever party wins will control the state senate. the district leans slightly democratic, but special elections with low turnouts are often the party's achilles' heel, just as midterms are. but if the grassroots energy is real, turnout won't be a problem.

jon ossoff, the leading 30-year-old democratic candidate in georgia's 6th district, is hoping to win an outright majority in the first round of voting next tuesday. strong democratic turnout in early voting looks good for him, but if he fails to gain a majority in the first round, where he is competing with many candidates, he will have to enter a runoff with a republican on june 20. his chances in the runoff look considerably slimmer.
these plans, which insurers have sold for decades, are supposed to provide minimal, temporary assistance for people with brief gaps in coverage. for that reason, they are not subject to the affordable care act's regulations. short-term policies do not have to cover mental health care, prescriptions, or other services that the 2010 health care law calls essential. and insurers don't have to sell these policies to people who have pre-existing medical conditions.
in fact, the person who chaffetz has seemed to go after most aggressively this year is the director of the office of government ethics, walter shaub. chaffetz sent shaub a stern letter accusing him of blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance when shaub's office tweeted about trump's potential conflicts of interest. chaffetz demanded a meeting with shaub, even threatening to subpoena him when a meeting did not work out. (emails between chaffetz's office and oge seemed to show that the botched sit-down was more chaffetz's fault than shaub's.)
despite his passion for the game, though, this latest season, which began feb. 20 and ended thursday, has not been kind. over the course of 25 matches, mulvaneym has had just four victories. another six ended in ties. the remaining 15 matches ended in defeat. as of today, he has officially placed last in his 25 person division.
washington ― president donald trump's administration made a bold guarantee sunday morning, telling americans that health insurance won't cost more if republicans repeal the affordable care act.
if the new york primary colored moulton's thinking, he didn't show it on wednesday. pragmatism was still his priority. he insisted that his group does not have any ideological or policy criteria for the candidates it endorses.
the claims that access to care and the financial security for those on medicaid has improved are based on another article in jama which presents data on self-reporting telephone surveys in adults aged 18-64 years (jama 2015; 314(4):366-74). there is a subjective bias in these types of surveys whereby those in favor of the aca are more likely to respond. objective measures such as claims data and health care outcomes would have been more convincing but were not done in this article. all of the authors in the cited article were employees of health and human services (hhs) and hhs reviewed and approved the article before submission. bias seemed obvious.
levine is currently the front-runner, in part because of a hefty amount of his own money he's thrown into the campaign. and while the energetic gillum holds strong positions that are attractive to progressives, his city hall was wracked by an fbi probe that could call his ethics and leadership into question.
the spring conventions of the michigan democratic party don't usually attract too much notice, described by the detroit free press as sleepy affairs filled with party regulars giving speeches and calls to action.
some women who've been prevented from pumping at work have chosen to pursue lawsuits under title vii of the civil rights act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. the statute itself does not explicitly say anything about pumping, but federal appeals courts in recent years have ruled that discrimination due to breastfeeding is a violation of that law. a lawsuit can lead to a big settlement or jury verdict, unlike a complaint filed under the nursing mothers provision. but the accommodations required under title vii are not nearly as clear and straightforward.
there is optimism that was not here before 63 million americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp, trump said. for decades, washington elites told us that americans had no choice but to accept stagnation, decay, and decline. we proved them wrong. our economy is strong once more. in a white house appearance, trump said, 
bryce has promised to abolish ice, whereas myers has said she'll seek reform. bryce seems to have the advantage in the primary, having raised six times more in funds for his campaign than myers. bryce has been endorsed by sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.).
i think it's going to be interesting to see how democrats can bring the health care issue in as an indictment of republicans and their values, but also as an economic conversation at a time when a lot of this is being driven by this kind of larger mood in the country, she said.
trump did pull out of the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement, as he promised, and the paris climate accord. he has also implemented a watered-down version of his promised extreme vetting of travelers from a group of mostly-muslim countries.
older people with lower incomes would disproportionately lack coverage because the legislation allows insurers to charge them higher rates than they do now ― and the financial assistance provided doesn't adequately offset that, cbo concludes. more low-income people in general would lack health coverage because the gop bill's tax credits wouldn't be large enough to make insurance affordable, the agency also projects.
biden's proposal calls for the creation of a government-run public option health care program that consumers could choose in lieu of private insurance, an idea that was a feature of early versions of the affordable care act until centrist senate democrats insisted it be scrapped to win their crucial votes on the final bill in 2010.
the path to a democratic senate majority — which creates hope to enact large swaths of president joe biden's agenda, and allowed the passage of the $1.9 trillion american rescue plan (containing $1,400 checks for most americans, a potentially revolutionary expansion of the child tax credit, more robust subsidies for obamacare, expanded unemployment benefits, a massive investment in native american tribes, rental assistance and cash for vaccine distribution) — is littered with turning points like this one.
in the meantime, the health care law has reduced the rate of uninsured americans to the lowest ever recorded and provided health care coverage to 20 million people who previously lacked it. and there are even promising signs that the law's health insurance exchanges, beset by large premium increases and diminished choices this year, may be righting themselves.
instead, the justice department filed briefs on behalf of the plaintiffs ― a move that trump reportedly ordered himself.
republicans, including close mcconnell allies, say the veteran senator will be able to turn the democratic attacks to his advantage as he runs for reelection in kentucky, potentially against democratic air force veteran amy mcgrath.

the backlash to gop proposals was a big reason repeal legislation failed to pass in 2017. and in 2018, republicans lost their house majority. the thrust of the health care debate threatens to prove a similar political drag for republicans in 2020, especially with the covid-19 outbreak making the issue such an important one.

in this case, according to the plaintiffs, the fatal constitutional flaw is the affordable care act's individual mandate, which in the original statute imposed a financial penalty on people who don't get health insurance. a 2017 tax law passed by a gop-controlled congress reduced the penalty to zero.
we're at an inflection point of four crises that we need to recover from, she told huffpost in an interview about her run. we need to rebuild from an economic crisis, rebuild from a health crisis, rebuild from a reckoning of racial injustice and rebuild from a loss of faith... in the ability of government to solve problems. and we need to do it in a way that addresses inequality and doesn't leave anybody behind.
the donald will construct the wall in two pieces, in unison. he will employ world-class architecture, construction, labor and technology on the us side. the south side will rely on mexican day laborers. i see a wall that arches towards mexico to the south and a second wall with an opposite arch to the north towards the us. that way no one will ever be able to scale the wall and make it in here. it is unknown what filler will bridge the gap between the walls. rumors are it will be water, alligators, and sharks. the creatures will provide entertainment for the guard staff should anyone make it over.

the 2020 election will likely be rigged.
in the final week before election day, trump barnstormed the country at rallies that were likely superspreader events, insisting that the country was rounding the corner. it was just the latest example of trump pretending the crisis did not exist and failing to respond even when his own experts were asking and sometimes begging him to act ― a pattern that stretched all the way back to january, when trump reportedly dismissed early warnings as alarmist.
trump has even lost his touch for manufacturing-related publicity stunts of the kind that frightened democratic operatives in the weeks after the 2016 election. his high-profile effort to save jobs at a carrier air conditioning plant in indianapolis, indiana, was a stroke of political genius ― however disappointing its results ended up being.
the trump administration on monday adopted a more extreme position on a lawsuit challenging the affordable care act: instead of asking the federal courts to throw out just one part of the law, as it had done previously, now the administration wants the courts to throw out the entire thing.
the stakes couldn't be higher. the health and well-being of tens of thousands of the most marginalized members of society hang in the balance, as does the promise that black lives really do matter.

heather waldron and john hawley are losing their four-bedroom house in the hills above blacksburg, va. a teenage daughter, one of their five children, sold her clothes for spending money. they worried about paying the electric bill. financial disaster, they say, contributed to their divorce, finalized in april.
u.s. district judge reed o'connor in fort worth, texas, agreed in december 2018, saying the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it no longer triggered a tax.
honestly, i feel that it's an honor. i feel that it's my obligation. it's my duty, he said. some of our grandmothers, our uncles, our fathers, our mothers, our sisters, our brothers, never really procured that opportunity to actually be a voice. even though it's a minute voice, it's still a voice nonetheless.
jayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. the committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill. even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on capitol hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-president harry truman's similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.
democratic upset hopes were driven in part by president donald trump's declining support in a state he won by more than 20 points four years ago. polling averages ahead of election day showed trump barely above 50% among kansas voters, at times holding a single-digit lead over democratic nominee joe biden. bollier, meanwhile, crafted a moderate campaign platform that went heavy on some democratic priorities ― she advocated for adding a public option to the affordable care act and boosting public education funding ― while avoiding issues like abortion and gun control. marshall, who opposes abortion rights, focused on the gop's confirmation of conservative judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court, the repeal of obamacare and trump's efforts to build a wall on the southern border.
at a closed-door briefing with rnc members in florida on thursday, the associated press reported, trump's new senior adviser paul manafort promised those who were present that his boss understands the need to tamp down the vitriol and had been merely projecting an image thus far that he would now adjust accordingly.
like his fellow republicans, trump wants to repeal the affordable care act and for the government to do less about the cost and the availability of decent coverage. biden wants to preserve and build upon the 2010 law also known as obamacare and enlarge the government's role in making health care more accessible and affordable.
the price of the gop's obstruction
long since, the gop killed its moderates and trashed everything they stood for. it has replaced respected figures like william cohen, richard lugar and john danforth with rigid ideologues like ted cruz and mike lee, and social illiterates like james inhofe, jeff sessions and richard shelby. on issue after issue, they have embraced an orthodoxy rooted in extremism and divorced from fact. these dynamics forced mitt romney to win the nomination by running so far right that he could never get back. and what was the lesson learned among the party base? that romney was not nearly extreme enough.
planned parenthood also came to the president's aid.

earlier this month, senate republicans took the first big step in their years-long crusade against the law. they say they want to ensure those people currently insured through the law wouldn't be hurt by efforts to replace it. rep. tom price (r-ga.), who is president donald trump's nominee to lead the department of health and human services, for example, says it is absolutely imperative that people with insurance get to keep their coverage even if republicans repeal obamacare.

bloomberg via getty images senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) attends a news conference after a weekly gop luncheon meeting at the capitol on tuesday. mcconnell is expected to release a revised health care bill thursday.
collins said the meeting with biden was productive, but the administration seems more concerned about the prospect of passing too little aid, rather than going too big. the gop plan is far less than what the biden administration and economists say is necessary to adequately address the economic and public health crises.

this is especially worrisome for the millions of people who have already lost jobs because a public health crisis has virtually shut down the u.s. economy. according to one estimate, the economic downturn that the novel coronavirus outbreak is triggering could leave as many as 40 million people uninsured.
and like so many other elements of health reform, any serious effort at capping payments to providers faces serious opposition from those providers' lobbying groups.
specifically, the richest 10% of new yorkers would be paying more for health care on average, while the other 90% would pay the same or less.
it's worse. at a forum sponsored by the aarp and the des moines register in iowa, biden trotted out scare tactics about health care reform that would make president donald trump proud.

on monday afternoon, republican sens. rob portman (ohio), shelley moore capito (w.va.), cory gardner (colo.) and lisa murkowski (alaska) ― all from states that have expanded medicaid ― warned that they could not vote for a bill that took away federal money for the expansion.
what matters is the intent of the congress who did the legislative act in question ― setting the penalty to zero, abbe gluck, a professor at yale law school, told huffpost. that congress was the 2017 congress, and that congress clearly concluded the rest of the statute could stand without the mandate.

but the new regulations would also render the law's insurance reforms less effective, making it more difficult for people who need or want more comprehensive coverage to get it.
correction: a previous version of this story mistakenly suggested that presumptive eligibility is another term for retroactive eligibility. in fact, they are two separate things, and kentucky's overhaul repeals only the latter.
a ruling against the law could also take different forms, including a decision that would send the case back to lower courts with instructions to reconsider.

it's just been announced that michigan residents are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike, trump said monday during a speech in warren, a working-class suburb north of detroit. it's been a disaster.
but state insurance officials like jessica altman, who is insurance commissioner in pennsylvania, say the administration isn't telling the public or would-be buyers the whole story about what the policies will cover ― and, more importantly, what they will not cover.
the first set of petitions asks the justices to hear the case of texas v. u.s., a lawsuit republican state officials brought and that president donald trump has supported. that lawsuit claims that when trump and congressional republicans reduced the law's individual mandate penalty to zero as part of their 2017 tax cut package, they introduced a fatal constitutional flaw that requires wiping out the entire law.
while trump and his republican allies on the hill can pass health care legislation without the help of democrats, there is only so much of obamacare they can undo. procedural rules in the senate dictate that only those parts of the law that have a budgetary impact can be considered through the legislative vehicle known as reconciliation ― which requires a simple majority vote for passage. other reforms to obamacare, such as scaling back certain insurance industry regulations, will require 60 senate votes to become law.
· millions of seniors would be left without nursing home coverage and other long-term care services, forcing their families to shoulder the burden. the average cost of nursing home care in the u.s. is now upwards of $90,000 a year, while the median household income is only about $55,775.
but the move would set a new precedent and potentially have an even bigger effect on how the senate operates since it could be applied widely to other issues.
and contrary to his campaign promise that he would empower medicare to negotiate bulk rates on drugs, trump has mostly treated the issue of prescription drug prices as an afterthought. when house democrats passed a bill in december that would empower the federal government to negotiate lower prices for up to 250 prescription drugs, the white house vowed that trump would veto the bill.

republicans did even more damage to the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid. in 2012, the supreme court upheld most of the law against a constitutional challenge. but in that same decision, it effectively made the medicaid expansion optional for states. in any state where republicans had the power to block expansion, they did.
a strong paid sick leave provision is going to be critical in reopening the economy, phadke pointed out.
he said he will always and republicans will always strongly protect people with preexisting conditions. that pledge has already been broken. he and they have repeatedly tried to weaken those protections in obamacare.
trump's central pennsylvania fans didn't want to see a more presidential version of the man who's broken all of the rules of political decorum and decency. and if trump knows how to do anything, it's giving his fans what they want.
meanwhile, the democratic attorneys general of 11 states and the district of columbia filed suit thursday to block the association health plans rule. the lawsuit claims these plans will disrupt the affordable care act markets and that the administration overreached in the regulation by redefining what an employer is under federal law.
months after the furor, tucked away in a capitol hill office decorated with maps, native alaskan art and fish mounted on the walls, she says she has no regrets.
out of the top 25 so-called metropolitan statistical areas with the highest rates of diagnosed hiv among msm, all but four are in the south, according to rosenberg's research. rosenberg also recently estimated that 11 percent of all young black msm in atlanta contract hiv every year.
megan alvanna-stimpfle, a tribal advocate who worked on sullivan's first campaign, plans to vote for biden, whom she believes is better positioned to unite the country.
what trump and the republicans have done
and i knew it was every inch a mirage, a lie, in my bones, because i knew america too well. i felt that obama, no matter how noble his campaign, was being propped up to mask the searing racism and economic injustices of our country. it was as if one single person, made to be a kind of superhuman superman, a savior, could, like an animated disney character, hypnotically evaporate what far too many americans had long experienced, physically, emotionally, spiritually and economically.
what could sen. susan collins be thinking? a vote on supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh is around the corner, and the official word from her, a republican from maine, is that she hasn't made up her mind. abortion rights supporters have flooded her state with television and digital ads in the desperate hope that collins will buck her party and vote against confirming kavanaugh, possibly saving roe v. wade for generations of women.
but barrett is a particular kind of successful woman; one of a very privileged few upper-income mothers who get to have good jobs with flexible hours. most working mothers do not have paid leave or workplace flexibility or health care; they are struggling to succeed. they don't need a well-off lady role model. they need policies that support their lives.
with president-elect donald trump set to assume office in little more than two weeks, the gop-led congress is already moving forward with republicans' longstanding desire to repeal the affordable care act. obama sought to rally his party to do whatever it can to thwart them, despite the terrible odds.
there is one more role mulvaney appears to have taken on during his time in the white house that has yet to be made public: since feb. 20, 2018, mick seems to have spent a portion of nearly every workday getting beaten at a private online trivia game.
yet, despite his outlandish statements and behavior, most republican party leaders largely bought into the same myth that millions of his fans had accepted for years: that trump was a shrewd and successful businessman and would employ those skills in the oval office. and like those fans, they came to that view from watching his long-running tv series, the apprentice, and its spinoff, celebrity apprentice.
this so-called coverage gap exists because the affordable care act was supposed to implement a medicaid expansion nationwide, making private insurance subsidies unnecessary for this population. but a 2012 supreme court ruling that allowed states to refuse the expansion left the poorest adults with no affordable coverage options.
the democratic spotlight on health care
president obama is not on the ballot this fall, but he has been the dominant political figure of the past eight years. when we go to cast our votes for president in november, the fundamental question is whether we want a president who will, by and large, share the policies and vision of barack obama, or one who in addition to being a hateful, uninformed, groper of a fascist who would destroy our position in the world, fundamentally rejects them - -not merely on matters like the size of government, but in every imaginable sense.
these kinds of views presume that our free market-based system offers full choice of health care without rationing--completely untrue.
and here are some questions mulvaney did not:
everything that has come since ― our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice ― all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before.
the only thing we don't have is a single senator willing to put patriotism over party in this pivotal moment.
about half of those newly eligible people are undocumented immigrants, de blasio said. the remaining uninsured generally are people who don't qualify for medicaid or other city, state and federal programs, including new york state of health, the insurance exchange. the new initiatives will target young adults in particular, he said.
i hear it's like record business that they're doing, trump said. we just opened about two months ago, and i'm hearing that the numbers are incredible. numbers of people that are getting really, really good health care instead of obamacare, which is a disaster.
single-payer health care proposals have become mainstream among democratic officials at all levels of government in the wake of vermont independent sen. bernie sanders's 2016 democratic presidential campaign and electoral wins last year by proponents of the policy who now serve in congress and state legislatures.
most surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. yougov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. if these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.
4: how did joe biden's son die?
sure, we occasionally hear from investor warren buffett, oracle of omaha and one of the world's richest people, lamenting how he pays taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. but nothing comes of this lamentation in terms of tax reform that would reduce that inequality. redistribution is anathema to the rich.
but the substance is key, as well.
who replaced malcolm turnbull on august 24, 2018, as prime minister of australia? (scott morrison)
that settled the issue ― or at least it did until 2017, when trump and the republicans in congress eliminated the penalty as part of their tax legislation that year. it didn't actually strike the mandate language; it simply reduced the penalty to $0.
when huffpost asked chaffetz about the trump hotel lease in late november, he said the tenant-landlord situation was true of every president, pointing to payments the secret service makes when agents are housed on the property of their protectees. chaffetz suggested he saw no difference between those situations and a contract explicitly prohibiting an elected official from being party to a $180 million lease.
for a lot of berners, defeating the republicans isn't the #1 priority. defeating the rigged economic/political system is. besides, there are plenty of reasons to not like hillary. which brings us to...
that's true. people with incomes below four times the poverty line, or roughly $49,000 for an individual, qualify for the affordable care act's tax credits. these people represent the majority of people buying on their own, and, for them, coverage tends to be within reach and sometimes even free, no matter how high premiums get. but the tax credits get smaller at higher incomes, and those who are above the subsidy threshold must pay full price. this is particularly rough on people in their 50s and 60s because, even under the affordable care act, insurers can charge older customers up to three times more than they charge younger ones.
how biden helped make obamacare possible
and there are still more issues to consider. why hasn't the gop made creative efforts to confront the problems of middle-class and working people -- many of whom have now turned to donald trump -- seeking solutions that are consistent with its philosophy? are we squandering the talents of our young people by saddling them with prohibitive student debt, cheating our society in the bargain? are we stifling struggling families by not trying to retrain their breadwinners?
with the sanders bill, the federal government would simply pay hospitals the way that medicare does now ― which, for the most part, means providing a fixed fee based on each patient's diagnosis. in the jayapal version, the government would basically give hospitals lump sums of money based on past expenses, and let them decide how best to allocate it.
but leadership hasn't indicated a desire to move negotiations out into the open, and it's not so hard to imagine how, eventually, they could work out a deal that would get them close to the 50 votes they need ― while still keeping the guts of the house plan and its dramatic effects on insurance coverage.
4. chelsea manning is on obama's shortlist for commutation. throw snowden in there too for the laugh. more here.
it's reportedly left voters who still haven't fully tuned into the race confused about who is who. one democratic voter told the new york times that between james and peters, his apolitical friends found it hard to tell who was the democrat and who was the republican.
the survey's results also drive home the degree to which the supreme court confirmation hearings were drowned out by news events that included congressional hearings about russia's role in the 2016 elections and a high-profile health care fight in the house. less than half of the public reports following the confirmation hearings even somewhat closely, with just 14 percent saying they've followed the proceedings very closely.
in the new scheme, most working-age adults in kentucky would have to demonstrate that they have spent at least 80 hours a month working or engaged in employment-related activities, like searching for a job or performing community service. many would also have to pay premiums, of up to $15 a month.
cornyn's job was to secure the votes to repeal the aca in 2017 when he was the senate gop whip, the third-highest-ranking republican. he spoke confidently for months about having the votes to do it. but the bill ultimately failed at the hands of senate democrats and three republicans.
when jesse lynn, 42, of orange county, bought short-term coverage as a bridge between policies, he and wife renee didn't realize the plan considered jesse's old back problems a preexisting illness, and therefore would not pay for treatment.
on a number of issues ― food stamps, a border wall, even obamacare ― republicans appear to be softening their hardline stances, if only for the moment before voters go to the polls.
because congress originally intended for the law's interlocking pieces to work together, and because judges must respect the will of congress, the entire statute should come off the books ― or so the lawsuit claims.
the long wait for a republican plan to fix the health care system will continue indefinitely, a status as tedious as it was predictable. president donald trump's most recent empty promises to come up with something better than the affordable care act lasted just a week, which was seven days longer than they deserved to last.
he called global warming the 'biggest scam of the last two decades'
at one point, verrilli urged roberts to put yourself in the position of a woman without contraceptive coverage. as verrilli pointed out, the underlying aim of the so-called birth control mandate is to ensure that virtually all insured people have access to this benefit as part of their regular insurance coverage for preventative medicine.
the role that president donald trump's reelection campaign will have on down-ballot candidates in the states is a big unknown, however.
the idea of increasing government spending, even the kind of modest investment a straightforward reinsurance program would need, isn't something gop leaders seem willing to consider. and so republicans are left to push ideas like the farm bureau plans, which could certainly save some people money but threaten to leave others, including the most medically vulnerable, worse off than before.
martin swanson, health policy director at the nebraska department of insurance, told huffpost that he and his colleagues are hearing about ministries more and more, especially at public information events. he said he always warns people that joining means giving up some coverage guarantees and that, if members run into trouble, his office won't be in a position to help them because nebraska is among the states that exempts ministries from insurance department oversight.
the answer was obviously yes. but roberts continued probing and questioning how the exchanges work, apparently unwilling to let go of the idea that somehow a woman could get covered simply by signing a paper to get on an insurance exchange. at one point, he even suggested that constitutional objections to a faulty law are sometimes what lead to its improvement.
in this new case, the plaintiffs argue that the architects of the affordable care act created a complex, interdependent policy machine that requires each of its components to work. an especially important feature is the individual mandate, the controversial financial penalty for people who don't get insurance, because the penalty encourages people to get insurance even if they don't have medical problems already.
the court's official calendar shows six days of oral arguments before the presidential election, which take places tuesday, november 3. but it typically takes weeks, sometimes months, after oral argument for the justices to issue rulings.
it didn't take long for the swamp to drain @realdonaldtrump. no shame, mr. president. almost everyone succumbs to the d.c. establishment. https://t.co/9bdo8yzh7i — justin amash (@justinamash) march 30, 2017
low-income americans would also face consequences in both access and cost under the repeal bill with the gop's plan to get rid of the expansion of medicaid and turn it into a block grant program.
the picture has become increasingly clear: prep is largely failing to help those who need an hiv prevention game changer most desperately, namely black msm, in particular those younger than 25.
do we need to nominate a moderate to win in 2020? no. it is a trap, de blasio said. when you listen to the moderates, i don't find them inspiring. i don't find them uplifting. i don't find them visionary.
if berners were all democrats, this anger and confusion would make sense. but they aren't -- they're a mix of democrats, hardcore liberals, left- and right-leaning independents, first-time voters, embarrassed/disaffected republicans, swing voters, young people, unaffiliated voters, infrequent voters, anti-establishment voters, single-issue voters, etc. it's an incredibly wide and diverse coalition of groups -- the kind needed to win elections in an age when simply turning out your party's base is no longer enough. few of those groups hold any allegiance to the democratic party or hillary in particular, who some of them downright loathe. so hillary supporters shouldn't expect berners to fall in line and unite with the democratic party's nominee when so many berners aren't traditional democrats and don't necessarily share the same enemy.
implications for today's debate over health policy
1: how old is joe biden?
after the affordable care act became law, the obama administration determined that association health plans had to follow the same rules on benefits and pre-existing conditions as other types of insurance. trump proposed a regulation this year to reverse that and let these plans ignore some of the law's consumer protection standards.
dr. al gross for senate/flickr dr. al gross has showcased his identity as an alaskan outdoorsman in campaign materials. some skeptics think gross' schtick is over the top.
the reality is, there are a lot of people that are thinking, 'i don't want a couple-thousand-dollar bill to get tested or to get treated,' khanna said. that's going to hurt all of us.
during that time, my medical school granted me a leave of absence. my parents and i were grateful for that. however, it turned out to be the start of another type of horrific experience: navigating insurance coverage before the affordable care act (aca) ― aka obamacare.
such policies, he explained at the blog balloon juice on thursday, would have tiny, narrow networks of doctors and hospitals, $20,000 deductibles, and maybe no coverage for things like asthma inhalers, epi-pens and insulin.
jorjani is a former adviser for fossil fuel moguls charles and david koch and has served as interior's principal deputy solicitor since may 2017. the job includes managing the agency's ethics office and, more recently, overseeing all public information requests sent to the agency. president donald trump officially tapped jorjani for the solicitor post last month, which has been vacant since the trump administration took office.
finding a respectable legal expert who will vouch for it on the merits is nearly impossible. before the death last week of justice ruth bader ginsburg, most informed observers expected the case to fail and possibly to fail big, with some and maybe even most of the other conservative justices joining roberts and the liberals in turning it away.
the affordable care act addressed this in two ways. first, it gave states money to expand medicaid so they could enroll all low-income people, including those with pre-existing conditions, directly into a government program. then it restructured the private insurance market by prohibiting all of the old practices.
the survey, part of a broader effort by end citizens united to develop the best democratic message on corruption and money in politics, also found that voters are evenly split between trump and democrats on who they can trust to crack down on corruption and the influence of money in politics.

banning abortion clearly does not stop abortion from happening, aiken says. that's the one thing we know definitively.
on thursday ― five days before the primary election ― mcsally's campaign put the ad on air.
sen. cory booker pushed kavanaugh on whether he shares justice antonin scalia's one-race theory, the belief that it's never permissible for the government to remediate past discrimination. booker cited old emails and opinion pieces written by kavanaugh on the matter and asked what he believed now.
some chafed at exhortations to wear masks, which became a cultural signifier in the red-versus-blue political wars, while others dismissed reports of sickness and death as fake news.
at least some of kellyanne conway's absurd rationalizations of trump disgracefulness have been original (such as the amazing alternative facts). this week, conway relied on an old gop trick (believe me), saying on abc's this week that the senate healthcare bill doesn't cut medicaid. while medicaid spending would rise year to year under the bill, the effect of the bill would be to cut medicaid spending from what would occur in the absence of the bill. that's a cut. (boss trump followed up with a tweet along the same lines.)
sen. mazie hirono (d-hawaii) told jorjani she found it hard to believe that his time working for the koch brothers didn't influence his decision to roll back migratory bird protections. jorjani held senior positions at the charles koch foundation and charles koch institute and worked as general counsel at the koch-supported freedom partners.
perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding china and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
the 1986 and 2017 tax acts also differ in more substantive ways. the main thrust of the 1986 legislation was to end the tax breaks that had tilted the playing field toward corporations and the rich, while cutting tax rates for all. and the 1986 bill did all this in a way that did not create more federal debt.
galloway said this year will be different because voters won't trust parson to implement the law. she noted that republicans in recent years have undermined voter-passed initiatives to end gerrymandering, and parson himself was the lead author of legislation that overturned a state ban on puppy mills put in place by voters in 2010.
lots of time and energy has been put into taking away health care from tens of millions of people, de blasio said tuesday during a press conference at a bronx hospital. what we're doing here in new york city, we're getting health care to a lot of people who never had it before. we're going the opposite direction.
but in the meantime, warren said, the federal government needs to impose new standards on private insurers to build on the accomplishments of the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare.
for a so-called genius, this was an epic fail, trump's campaign manager, corey lewandowski, said. if professor hawking wants to do some damage, maybe he should try talking in english next time.
this is the part that always just astonishes me, warren said. donald trump ran on draining the swamp. what did he turn around and do? he brought in the biggest swamp rats and put them in charge.
apparently the high-profile visits were not enough to stem quist's momentum. on tuesday, influential conservative writer erick erickson tweeted that internal republican polls show quist made gains in the race over the weekend.
amash said he could hardly believe other republicans thought trump was doing them a favor. (they think it's helpful?! he asked in amazement.) and he suggested trump was doing this only to change the conversation, possibly away from special counsel robert mueller's report.
the candidates, many of whom desperately needed a breakout moment in order to keep their campaigns aloft, delivered sharp blows against each other, with little sense of a clear winner by the end of the night.
for now, that larger deal looks unlikely.
q: what about the other top candidates?
in 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon. half a century later, we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: buzz aldrin. this year, american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets.
then there is the other big asterisk in the rand report.
what they pay me, the pain is not worth it, he said. they say quickly, 'thank you for your service,' but you can't pay a bill with that statement.
the other reason democrats are pounding away at the issue is that the stakes are high, with the livelihoods ― and lives ― of many americans depending on the outcome. the aca rewrote the rules for insurers selling plans directly to individuals and families so that carriers could no longer deny coverage or otherwise discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.
that may be enough for many of their members. even the lammers seem okay for now. their baby is due in april and they can finally think about paying for diapers rather than tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills.
5. don't bernie fans want america to have its first female president?
uva medical center, the flagship of uva health system, earned $554 million in profit over the six years ending in june 2018 and holds stocks, bonds and other investments worth $1 billion, according to financial statements. ceo sutton-wallace earns a salary of $750,000, with bonus incentives that could push her annual pay close to $1 million, according to a copy of her employment contract, obtained under public information law.
biden advisers say they see clear evidence in both polling and the results of the 2018 midterm elections to bolster their contention that the party tilts more toward centrists like the former vice president than toward liberals.
when our opponents talk about destabilization of the current system, they forget to tell you that the current system is already disrupting and destabilizing millions of people's lives.
anyone who does not pay their premiums or submit paperwork to show their eligibility would lose their coverage and would not be able to reapply for six months, although people who don't pay premiums could restore coverage by completing a financial literacy course (the details of which aren't yet clear).
it also would increase how much the federal government pitches in for state medicaid programs and subsidizes cobra, the federal program that lets recently laid-off americans continue their former employer's health insurance plan at personal cost. cobra is rarely an affordable option for recently unemployed americans because of the high costs of private insurance, which are typically subsidized by employers. this proposal would cover the entire cost of an individual's private insurance premium with federal dollars.
it's person to person, he said. people taking care of each other.
adler actually signed a separate brief, an updated version of one that he wrote with three other law professors: the university of michigan's nick bagley, yale's abbe gluck and george mason's ilya somin.
and once ryan was in charge of writing gop budgets, starting in 2011, he relied heavily on generous assumptions about economic growth and unspecified spending cuts that nobody seriously believed congress would make.
the old risk was medical, the new risk is legal, says jamila perritt, md, an obstetrician and a fellow with physicians for reproductive health in the washington, d.c., area. the old symbols, like coat hangers, back alleys, will be replaced by new symbols, like handcuffs and prison bars.
casey reaffirmed it and became a precedent on precedent, kavanaugh said.
maine follows seven other states that allow apcs to perform abortions, a practice supported by health organizations including the american public health association and the american college of obstetricians and gynocologists.
i'm just thrilled beyond anything that it's not hillary clinton, chaffetz said. i'm just thrilled that we're not calling her president clinton.
with expanded and enhanced subsidies, an increasing share of workers may find that they are better off getting coverage on the marketplaces and would prefer that their employers drop coverage so that they can receive a wage bump, eibner said. the availability of a cheaper public option might also push people towards the marketplace if the public option successfully negotiates competitive prices with providers without sacrificing on quality or network breadth.
if the credits go out every month, that's even worse, rep. thomas massie (r-ky.) told huffpost on friday. advance monthly refundable tax credits is a euphemism for a new monthly entitlement check, he said.
green believes that warren laid a trap for other candidates by laying out her fully baked medicare for all plans right before the debate.
that's not the only threat to the aca right now. there's also the lawsuit that hawley, along with officials from 19 other politically conservative states, has co-signed. the plaintiffs argue that, because the 2017 gop tax cut reduced the aca's individual mandate penalty to zero, the law's insurance regulations are now unconstitutional. even many conservative experts think the case relies on an absurd legal argument, but it has support from the trump administration. next week, it will go before a conservative federal judge in fort worth, texas.
then there is the assistance on cost-sharing. it is available only to consumers who buy silver policies and whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line ― about $30,000 for an an individual and $61,000 for a family of four this year. it gets very little attention because even most of the people who get the money don't realize it. (the exchanges factor in the assistance automatically, so that policies simply appear to have lower deductibles and co-payments.) but for the millions who get it, it's the difference between insurance that works and insurance that doesn't.
it's going to be a long day. here's the schedule for day two of kavanaugh's hearing, via cnn.
that is, more or less, how the market in iowa has evolved. but the problems have at least as much to do with decisions by the state's political and business leaders as they do with the health care law's design.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.
feinstein: can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?
it's a target-rich environment, he said in late october. even before we get to day one, we've got two years' worth of material already lined up.
we had a republican congress, he said. (in fact, in obama's first two years, when criminal justice reform was not a national priority on the level that it is now, democrats controlled congress.)
alicia garza, a co-founder of black lives matter, echoes this sentiment. she is using her new nonprofit to cultivate a discussion around who's left out of national conversations about black voters. garza leads the black futures lab, which works to help build black people's political power; the organization is using its initiative black to the ballot to expand the black electorate by reaching out to residents in rural areas, those who identify as trans and others whose voices are not generally considered by mainstream. she told huffpost that their goal is to register 10,000 people this year.
republican party leaders, nevertheless, failed to perform even cursory research into trump's background when he began his presidential run in june 2015. instead, they bought into his self-proclaimed wealth and believed his threats that he would run as a third-party candidate using his own money if republicans were not nice to him, a view that informed several key decisions in the weeks and months that followed. when trump during the first gop debate refused to promise to back the eventual nominee, then-party chairman reince priebus could have informed trump that he would not be participating in the second debate. instead, priebus traveled to trump tower and begged trump to sign a pledge to back the nominee, whoever that might be. in so doing, priebus instantly gave trump the high status within the party that he had previously lacked.

afterward, biden summed up the goal of his agenda.
but the white house and gop lawmakers appear to be taking things further by questioning the very legitimacy of the office tasked with telling lawmakers and the american people what new policies will do to the government, businesses, households and the economy.
i do, i absolutely do. and look, i'm not, in the context of my prior comment, i wasn't defending the aca per se as the ideal. i actually think it's kind of moved beyond where we've been.
that big money machine is going to be there, but it's really that grassroots network ― it's really there, schachtner said.
and sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) ― who apparently is among the fortunate few whose calls trump will pick up whenever they come in ― is suddenly concerned that the gop's repeal-and-delay effort will land the republican party in a box canyon, which actually sounds pretty fun until you find out that box canyon is a strained metaphor for being on the hook for an unexpected tax increase. as roll call's niels lesniewski reports:
but independent voters noticed and, in the polls, preferred biden on that front. again, it would have taken only a small shift to have an impact on those closely divided swing states.
and in maine, mills signed a bill that requires student loan lenders to register in order to do business in maine. the bill prohibits predatory actions such as misleading borrowers and committing fraud. the state also would be able to investigate lenders for these claims.
neither is a fight over protecting people with pre-existing conditions less.
the representative also encouraged people to check the healthcare.gov site now to determine if they may already be able to enroll because of a change in circumstances, such as losing a job.
that was just a projection, of course. but four years later, douglas elmendorf, who was cbo director at the time, told congress that the agency saw no reason to doubt its initial judgment.
the 2019 race was an unusual one — the product of an absentee voting fraud scandal in 2018, when a gop operative tampered with ballots, resulting in a special election. since getting over that hurdle, republicans in the state have been resting a little bit easier. but, while the race has gone a little under the radar, it's still competitive. and in a year where there's a competitive senate and presidential race on the ballot, districts like the 9th could swing in a major wave.
cawthorn, a parapalegic who became paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident in 2014, has been a controversial candidate. he was accused of sexual misconduct, which he responded to by saying the encounter was in good humor and calling the accusation politically motivated. in old now-deleted posts on instagram, cawthorn referred to adolf hitler with the honorific fuhrer and called his visit to hitler's vacation home as a trip on his bucket list. more recently, his campaign created an attack website that went after a local reporter for working for non-white males, like cory booker, who aims to ruin white males running for office. cawthorn said the line was a syntax error, meant to deride identity politics.
legal battles aside, the obama health law has remained remarkably stable. even with the repeal of the law's tax penalty, 11.4 million people signed up for coverage this year, just a slight dip from 2018. the law's medicaid expansion continues to insure about 12 million low-income people. and several million young adults are on their parents' health insurance as a result of the aca.
that is not to say 9 million people will be unhappy.
defunding family planning providers and endangering the health care of tens of thousands of low-income mainers ― those are the devastating results we're seeing in the era of sen. collins and president trump, said alex stack, spokesman for the maine democratic party.
blitz has health coverage from his employer now, but having lived through the insurance system that existed before the aca, he knows how valuable affordable care can be for people like him.
i voted for wall funding on three separate occasions, he said.
a political world trying to make sense of president donald trump's weeklong push of a nonsensical accusation against his predecessor is again overthinking the issue, according to two top republicans close to trump. it is more akin to trump indulging in one of his favorite comfort foods ― in this case, a return to the race-based attacks on the country's first black president that won trump his stature within the republican party nine years ago.
but actually crafting a policy that would cut hospital payments enough to free up big sums of money without adverse effects wouldn't be easy and getting such a policy through congress could be even tougher. the hospital industry is already pushing back and, as this debate moves forward, it's only going to push harder.
of course, it doesn't hurt that norman is an ultraconservative real estate developer who said he would have voted for the house's obamacare repeal bill, backs raising the social security retirement age, and reacted to the shooting at the congressional baseball practice last week by calling for more members of congress to carry guns.
i voted to protect people with pre-existing conditions, mcsally said. we cannot go back to where we were before obamacare, where people were one diagnosis away from going bankrupt, because they could not get access to health care.
the main argument republicans make about their proposal ― the reason they say it will improve access ― is that it would reduce costs. at first blush, the argument seems plausible.
to debra, heather, madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. but i will never forget, and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon, that it should never happen again.
anthem said on thursday that it intends to promptly file a notice of appeal and request an expedited hearing of its appeal to reverse the court's decision.
our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family, powell said. for joe biden, that doesn't need teaching. it comes from the experience he shares with millions of military families — sending his beloved son off to war and praying to god he would come home safe.
he tweeted that while he wouldn't defend or endorse trump, he would vote for him. he had apparently figured out how to look his daughter in the eye.
our message is not that politics are not important. our message is that when politics work, politics represent the needs of the public. and there's a variety of reasons why they don't right now. and we could probably go through a litany of them, and they include things that are far outside of health care. it has to do with things that you and i could probably both identify: the way money works in politics, the way districts are drawn ― all these things that are making us more polarized.
i think the left has turned him into a deity on the right. the more they highlight what he's doing in the senate, the more popular he becomes, said josh holmes, a former mcconnell chief of staff who remains one of the senator's top political lieutenants. every time donald trump attacks nancy pelosi, it makes her stronger. when democrats attack mitch mcconnell, it makes him stronger.
the thing that will fundamentally change things is with donald trump out of the white house. not a joke, biden told reporters this week while campaigning in concord, new hampshire. you will see an epiphany occur among many of my republican friends.
if you are still on the fence i encourage you to vote not for who i want you to vote for but for who your grandchildren would be proud you fucking voted for, he wrote, followed by an apology to his wife, jeannie gaffigan, for his use of profanity.
all of this is likely to make short-term coverage an attractive option for people healthy enough to qualify for it. because the policies don't pay for many expensive services and because the policies aren't available to the people most likely to run up large bills, the premiums are a lot lower than the premiums for comprehensive coverage ― a fact that the trump administration highlighted this week as it touted the new regulations.
indeed, this is fantastic news—for white msm.

sen. bill cassidy (r-la.) told huffpost he isn't even sure where negotiations are headed.
but nothing is certain, and on monday the justice department, which already endorsed the plaintiffs' arguments, told the 5th circuit that it also supported their preferred remedy: invalidating the entire program. the decision came from the white house, with trump overruling several skittish advisers, according to reports that first appeared in politico.
if you're the sort of person who still believes president donald trump's promises on health care, there's probably nothing at this point that could dissuade you from the notion that republicans have a fix at the ready to replace obamacare.
trump's actions in recent weeks show that he not only realizes the dire situation he's in but is trying to do whatever he can to save himself before november.
and although barrett hasn't said a lot about the health care law, her one major comment came in a 2017 law review article, when she said a previous decision upholding the law pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.
this came out of mitch mcconnell's and paul ryan's world, not donald trump's. they just needed him to sign it. that's all, said rick wilson, a republican political consultant and vocal trump critic. donald trump couldn't name five tangible things in this tax law.
in health care, the invisible hand [of the free market] fails to drive down costs, improve quality, or ensure distributional outcomes that are regarded as fair. we can tinker with the rules, regulations and payment schemes that govern medical care, but the forces that increase the demands for and supply of more care are relentless. only powerful countervailing institutions can keep them under control. only governments have the necessary authority, assuming they have the political will to use it. (7)
beshear wanted to focus the race on economic issues, like bevin's cuts to public education, his targeting of public pensions, and his attempts to end kentucky's embrace of medicaid and obamacare. beshear showed an uncanny ability to stay on message, but the teachers also made that easier. the prominence of their issues in the race weakened bevin's attempts to go after beshear on social issues like abortion, and turned what bevin wanted to be a national referendum on trump and impeachment into a fight over local issues.
we cannot forget: this victory happened because people in every corner of our country committed their time and energy to calling their representatives, showing up at town hall meetings, and making their voices heard, clinton said in a statement she shared on twitter. the fight isn't over yet ― we will have to push back on future bad ideas and embrace good ones to make health care more affordable ― but we are reminded today that there is no substitute for standing up and defending our values.
rep. earl blumenauer (d-ore.) claimed resistance works.
this court case could take months to resolve. if mcconnell or any other gop leaders in congress wanted to, they could resolve the dispute with legislation, or at least file briefs of their own explaining their intentions when they repealed the mandate penalties. but they haven't, and there's no evidence they will.
we want to just keep building for the future and try to get a democratic presence in this area once again, said susan maxson, a 54-year-old rock hill resident volunteering for parnell.
i think that's right. but look, if you want to tell your readers that medicaid expansion is a public program and not private sector, go ahead and tell them that. you know that's wrong.
washington ― every day since jan. 11, republicans have reminded us that house democratic leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said that day that workers have gotten nothing but crumbs from the gop tax bill.

if the findings from the henry j. kaiser family foundation's health tracking poll published tuesday are any indication, the less-ambitious plans from candidates like former vice president joe biden and sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) may be on to something.
democrats immediately went to town on the suit, blasting out ads and fundraising emails warning that the trump administration wants to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
if they wanted to destroy the insurance market immediately, then the easiest thing they could do would be to stop paying, said timothy jost, a professor at washington and lee university law school.
you, an elected official, [are] giving misinformation, she said. right now, our taxes do not pay for abortions. they pay for mammograms, they pay for birth control.
daines backs the lawsuit, which argues the entire affordable care act should be struck down because congress repealed the mandate for individuals to buy health insurance as part of the republican tax law passed in 2017.
insurers losing money might react by finding ways to cover fewer medical bills or simply pulling out of markets altogether. they could also cite such experience as reason to raise premiums in the future.
after 10 years of fighting the affordable care act and against all evidence, republicans are suddenly downplaying the threat that a supreme court case advanced by their own party could pose to the law.
it took priti chati, 62, of roanoke six years to pay a $44,000 uva bill for brain surgery and have a home lien removed last year, court records show. she had had a pre-obamacare policy that did not cover preexisting illness. the health system seized bank funds intended for her daughters' college costs, she said. she sold jewelry and borrowed from friends, eventually paying more than $70,000 including interest, she said.
during a debate with kelly last month, however, mcsally avoided saying whether she supported trump when asked point-blank by a moderator.
bernie sanders on wednesday is formally introducing an updated version of his bill to enroll every u.s. resident in a single, government-run health insurance plan.
democrats like clinton because she has been fighting outrageous republican attacks for more than 20 years. she's still got it (see: benghazi hearings), and it's democratic primary gold (see: post-benghazi-hearing polls). that's clinton's best argument for the nomination. smearing policy proposals that democrats have spent years fighting for? not so much.
fitzpatrick, who eked out re-election by 2.5 percentage points, said that he voted against the bill because it didn't protect people with pre-existing conditions and that republicans were wrong that a renewed focus on health care would help them politically.
wisconsinites in the western part of the state who like baldwin, however, rarely mentioned her progressive bonafides when they were naming reasons they support her. over and over, they said she's responsive and willing to work with others. she is, in other words, typically midwestern nice. (being nice is so prized that one woman at the stockholm meet-and-greet objected to the term minnesota nice, saying that state shouldn't get to own the quality.)
another reason aetna decided to shutter those florida, georgia and missouri plans, the judge said, was to reduce overlap with humana's offerings and thereby strengthen its case challenging the justice department's disapproval of the merger. bates even cited evidence that aetna tried to shield its internal communications on this matter under attorney-client privilege. at one point, an aetna official talking about plans wrote, i was told to be careful about putting any of that in writing. i will have the attorney client privilege ccd by tomorrow.
but there's one recent and prominent counterexample to the idea that winning in public opinion wars is the surest path to change. in 2013, following the massacre of first-graders at an elementary school in newtown, connecticut, opinion polling showed more than 90 percent of voters supported universal background checks and a ban on selling assault weapons. that didn't prevent an overwhelming majority of gop senators and even four democrats from voting against a bill to expand background checks for gun sales.
and those two items, along with slower-than-expected growth in health care costs nationwide, combined to result in the cbo being wrong about another thing: the amount of money the law would cost, which wound up being less than expected.
auditor nicole galloway, the democrat challenging gop gov. mike parson, said she was confident missourians would vote yes on tuesday's referendum, which republicans intentionally scheduled for a lower-turnout primary day instead of for november's general election.
since the crisis, financial reform advocates have worked to make break up the banks the core democratic party message on wall street. pretending that the guy who is tough on too big to fail is weak on wall street doesn't really register with anyone outside the class of former and potential clinton advisers.
and rep. justin amash (r-mich.) denounced the legislation as obamacare 2.0.
president donald trump this week likened the supposed gaffe to hillary clinton's infamous deplorables comment from the 2016 campaign.
a lot of words to describe such a transformation come to mind. mercy isn't really one of them.
when ginsburg began the women's rights project in 1972, there were more than 1,000 laws on the books that disadvantaged women, who could be denied a credit card or refused a mortgage on their own. these patriarchal constrictions assumed that men called the shots and that women belonged at home.
in his video, flanked by an american flag and a texas state flag, he added: you know, i look forward to staying in touch with everyone. it's been an honor and a privilege to serve. thank you so much. please, stay in touch. i love y'all. god bless you, god bless texas, god bless america.
the strizichs spent $1,500 of their own money to buy a camper van that became the medicaid mobile that's been up and down idaho over the past few months. supporters have signed the outside of the van, making it a kind of rolling petition.
this is not simply about donald trump. for trump is not the result of forces which will come and go, but of a deterioration within the republican party that has been accelerating for years. the gop has become a frankenstein monster, assembled from dysfunction, demagoguery, myopia and myth, nurtured in a fever swamp where lies and hysteria kill off reason. nothing better will arise until you help drive a stake through its heart.
this is an expansive package of proposals that would make aca coverage more affordable and reduce the number of people uninsured, but it is not a replacement for the far-reaching plans for universal coverage like medicare for all, larry levitt, senior vice president for health reform at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, told huffpost. with democrats proposing to solidify and build on the aca and the trump administration still trying to repeal it, the health care battle lines for 2020 are pretty clear.
straight medical assistance (without disability) qualifying limit is 133% of the poverty level, or $1,317 per month, with no asset limit.
i think he should go out on a high. he was already a successful vice president, claudia graham, a 64-year-old from sun city, south carolina, said as she waited in line to hear o'rourke speak at a town hall on friday.
almost exactly three years ago, the republican senate failed to pass a bill that would have repealed the affordable care act and replaced it with a law that would have snatched health coverage from 16 million people. in the 10 years since obamacare″ became law, that's as close as the gop has gotten to fulfilling its promise to scrap the aca and pass its own health care bill.
but judge jennifer walker elrod, who was appointed by former president george w. bush, appeared to see things differently. if you don't buy insurance, she said, then you are violating the law.
but keep in mind, this is not an organization that is in place of any of the other efforts. i think it hopes to assist in helping to get some of these things done.
in the climate sector, maine's legislature passed three significant renewable energy and climate action bills, including a commitment to reducing carbon and setting a target for using 100% renewable energy by 2050. they also passed an offshore wind initiative.
i just have the confidence to make my own decisions and not be influenced by anybody, whether it's a donor or a lobbyist or anyone else, he said.
but even that figure doesn't fully capture the coverage impact of gop changes. in particular, it doesn't include more than 4 million additional people who would be insured but have these short-term plans without the pre-existing condition and essential benefit guarantees, the researchers say.
the republican party has shifted, he told reporters on the way out of his election night party tuesday. it is the era of trump, and i'm just not a trump-like politician.
aside from health care, which dominated much of the discussion, voters at the town hall appeared to be concerned about the president's decision to fire fbi director james comey. they urged macarthur and other republicans to stand up to the president and call for an independent investigation into comey's ouster and the trump campaign's possible ties to russia.
we're asking the president to open the government, she told reporters on the white house driveway. we are giving him a republican path to do that. why would he not do that?
all of that suggests that the hospitals could handle major reductions without harm to access to quality. the evidence is pretty clear that there's room to cut without major damage, says loren adler, associate director of the usc-brookings schaeffer initiative for health policy.
helen parshall rev. dr. dennis wiley joins in a symbolic washing away of negativity around women's reproductive decisions during an interfaith ceremony at the the carol whitehill moses center.
chip somodevilla via getty images former interior secretary ryan zinke.
perhaps trump will do something truly audacious: suggest that the gop simply fix the affordable care act, sell it as a repeal-and-replace job, and rebrand the whole thing trump care. indeed, that canyon is only truly boxed if trump ignores the exit pass, the one that leads to a health care system that people actually like.
william campbell/getty images greg gianforte, the republican candidate for montana's open house seat, stands to benefit financially from the american health care act.
that is no minor thing. medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. it's why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals.
but circumstantial evidence abounds that she will vote to confirm, and to that pile we can add something gleaned from a source close to collins' staff: she approved kavanaugh in her consultations with president donald trump before he settled on a nominee.
some of this was shameful. the gop countenanced a race-based birtherism directed at our first black president, giving donald trump a political foothold. it nurtured xenophobia that targeted all muslims at home and abroad. it pretended that illegal immigrants were poisoning our economy. it aped the mindless masters of talk radio and trafficked in conspiracy theories. it embraced tea party dead-enders who claimed that shutting down the government, at whatever cost, was the only answer.
our campaign has heard from voters across the state who had trouble making their voices heard, and their votes counted, booker said in a statement that highlighted confusion among voters about whether their mailed-in ballots had been received and whether there had been problems with those ballots that rendered them unintentionally invalid.

despite the negativity, you have a big chunk of the country that wants this thing to succeed, obama said, according to a person who attended the meeting with house and senate democrats. that the country is clamoring to undo this thing is simply untrue.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) made some noises about how everybody in the senate supports protections for pre-existing conditions ― a strange comment from a man who attempted to shepherd the weakening of those protections through the senate last year.
although biden, a democrat, isn't campaigning in favor of anything as dramatic as medicare for all, it's hard to overstate the differences between his vision for american health care and trump's.
one is the transition period, which is more than twice as long as the four-year changeover in the sanders bill. harris says her transition will include a series of benchmark tests to make sure the new program delivers affordable, quality coverage.
rik is only able to afford his rent through the generosity of others, because of the spend-down he is only left with $792 a month, which barely covers his living expenses (without rent).
yet the ongoing efforts to undermine the law ― and how that affects voter sentiments ― are an x-factor in all of this. last year's gop tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don't get insurance. without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.
it's difficult to compare the unilateral actions of different presidencies, but it seems that the trump administration's social policy power grabs have been drastic by recent standards, said ron haskins, a senior fellow at the brookings institution.
the companies cite hhs statistics to claim they are owed $12 billion.

republicans chose a different approach for their 2017 bill. that year congressional republicans were under tremendous pressure from trump, his base, and their wealthiest donors to do two big things: repeal obamacare and enact tax cuts by the end of the year. their first legislative effort failed. on july 28, the effort to repeal obamacare died with a no vote by sen. john mccain, r-ariz.
baldwin said she has no problem criticizing trump. but she isn't making him a focus of her campaign, and she's not bringing him up every chance she gets. indeed, during her three-stop swing through western wisconsin last week, she mentioned trump only once or twice by name, although she referenced the president a few other times. for one of the most liberal members of the senate, baldwin hardly talked fiery resistance rhetoric all day long.
there's a lot left to do, mayville told huffpost, but they're getting there. after election day, reclaim idaho had collected 29,000 signatures, passing the halfway point. and they've either met or very nearly met the 6 percent threshold in as many as seven legislative districts and are within a couple hundred signatures in eight more, he said.
to counter accusations that their bill was passed on speed-dial and was strictly partisan, republicans say the bill was six years in the making. they relied on bipartisan research and hearings, they say, conducted from 2011 to 2014 by democratic sen. max baucus of montana and republican rep. dave camp from michigan. back then, baucus chaired the senate finance committee and camp headed the house ways and means panel, yet they could not persuade a divided congress to take up their tax reform ideas.
nearly 5,000 people came to the convention, with longtime attendees saying they had never seen anything like it.
if only there was a way to get the f-35 to run on coal, it would be a perfect budget, he added.
what republicans didn't realize was that national democrats were also celebrating, just a bit more quietly.
with few legislative accomplishments under his belt, president <a href=https://www.huffpost.com/topic/donald-trump>donald trump</a> has repeatedly turned to executive orders ― a tool once maligned by republicans ― to undo much of former president barack obama's <a href=https://www.huffpost.com/topic/obama-legacy>regulatory legacy</a>. while some have been consequential ― like approving the construction of the keystone xl pipeline ― <a href=http://data.huffingtonpost.com/2017/trump-executive-orders>many of trump's orders have been symbolic</a>, like one minimizing the burden of obamacare regulations. <br><br>trump appears to enjoy the act of signing executive orders and bills more than any of his recent predecessors. while other presidents have also ceremoniously signed documents, trump regularly holds up his work for photo opportunities.
these states also already have relatively generous health care safety nets. the uninsured rates in all three states are below the national average of 10 percent as of 2017, the most recent year for which census data on the uninsured at the state level are available.
health care was the first big flash point in tuesday night's presidential debate, although it was hard to follow because it played out like every other exchange in the 90-minute event: with interruptions, non sequiturs and over-talk from president donald trump.
the affordable care act has mitigated these problems for millions of americans, by reducing the number of people without health insurance to historic lows. access to care has generally improved, researchers have found, especially for those who ended up with insurance through medicaid.
trump backing a lawsuit to shatter the affordable care act and making transparently meaningless promises about health care reform is even more ridiculous because democrats control the house.
they cut the sign-up period in half. they cut the budget for enrollment assistance by 40 percent. they cut the advertising and outreach budget by 90 percent. they forbade federal employees from participating in local enrollment efforts. the department of health and human services even used money intended to promote enrollment on a public relations campaign advocating affordable care act repeal.
the shift is real ― and an outgrowth of changing circumstances in politics and policy. for most of the last few years, and especially in 2017, democrats were preoccupied with trying to defend the affordable care act from repeal at the hands of the republicans.
a polywood manager did not respond to requests for comment.
chip somodevilla via getty images arizona rep. martha mcsally has tamed what had the makings of a rambunctious gop senate primary by aligning herself with president donald trump.
that's clear by how they're vilifying any republican who breaks with them, sending a message to all in the party. retiring rep. trey gowdy (r-s.c.), who's spent years pushing every kind of benghazi conspiracy theory about hillary clinton, recently dismissed trump's spygate conspiracy and defended the fbi. for that, gowdy, the chairman of the house oversight committee and a major player on the house intelligence committee, has come under nasty attack from some house colleagues while the gop leadership has stayed silent. trump's outlandish lawyer rudy giuliani jabbed gowdy for drinking the kool-aid, and fox news' maniacal judge jeanine pirro railed that her hero gowdy had gone to the dark side.
incredibly, that's the storyline pushed by conservatives and republicans, who appear eager to co-opt the legacy of women's rights champion ruth bader ginsburg on barrett's behalf.
(whose senator cory gardner might think twice about making life harder for the one in five coloradans who are medicaid-dependent). 14 million is about 2.5 times the population of republican house leader paul ryan's home state of wisconsin . janesville, where he was born, had a population of 63,000 in 2013; the legions of the newly uninsured would populate this small city, and also his college alma mater, miami university in ohio, hundreds of times over.
sarah lueck, a senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities, says the danger may be even bigger than it seems because anybody who joins the farm bureau could get a plan and membership is open to non-farmers.
while price was trying to tamp down fears that people will have to pay more for health insurance under the gop scheme, gary cohn, trump's chief economic adviser, was trying to convince people that it doesn't matter whether fewer americans will have coverage.
of course, looked at from another perspective, trump does sort of have a health care plan.
his opening line was, nice use of the parenthetical.
alaska's at-large congressional seat: rep. don young (r) vs. alyse galvin (d)

twitter users dunked on donald trump jr. after he shared yet another inaccurate meme on friday.
but either of these approaches would require kansas to put up some money of its own. the same would be true for expanding government insurance plans, up to and including the creation of a single-payer system.
the vote delay, while not the floor defeat that the freedom caucus and reluctant moderates had been promising, is still a huge loss for congressional leaders like house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and house majority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.), as well as for trump.
at the same time, it would entail its own set of trade-offs, such as new federal spending that would require new revenue and the retention of a large, wasteful private insurance bureaucracy.
i'm so thankful, and i say to people, 'if i could do it, you could do it,' barnes said. i always like to tell my story.
a local businesswoman who went on to start a national anti-bullying non-profit, newman, 55, has endorsed much of the sanders-warren agenda — from a $15 federal minimum wage to medicare for all, a green new deal and partial student debt cancellation.
by letting the rest of the law stand, a judge would simply allow the status quo to continue. of course, that is precisely why trump wants the courts to defy convention. the status quo is a world in which obamacare still exists. trump remains desperate to get rid of it, even if it means asking the courts to do what congress won't ― and leaving millions, probably tens of millions, of americans newly struggling to find affordable health care.
but those stands do put biden out of step with some corners of his party. despite the increased popularity of obama's health law, surveys show the idea of a government-backed medicare for all system, which numerous democratic candidates have proposed, is also backed by a vast majority of democrats. according to a kaiser family foundation poll taken last month, both medicare for all and obamacare were viewed favorably by about 80 percent of democrats.
as it happens, the gop's effort to undo the law's accomplishments ended up demonstrating just how popular those accomplishments are. millions of people have insurance they couldn't get before, because they couldn't afford it or because they had pre-existing conditions. americans may not be thrilled with obamacare, but they have no appetite for giving up those gains.
they did not. they made ailing responders lobby them for months while using the 9/11 bill as leverage to move items on their own agendas such as lifting an oil export ban.
but a reporter asked spicer the natural follow-up: if eliminating maternity coverage will reduce premiums overall, won't it also mean higher costs for people who actually need the care?
you've got to talk them into it, joe, trump said. like i did with criminal justice reform ― i had to talk democrats into it.
mccain and trump feuded frequently during the president's first 18 months in office, and the president has continued to attack mccain since the senator's death last august. mccain refused to endorse trump during the 2016 campaign, and later attacked his approach to politics as a half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.

biden's order would directly affect healthcare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace currently serving 36 states. the marketplace concluded a successful annual sign-up season in december, with enrollment for 2021 growing by about 7%. final numbers for this year that include insurance markets directly run by the states will be available soon.
in expansion states, medicaid could serve as a valuable stopgap for people who lose jobs and health benefits. if you've just had a big change in income, like you lost your job and your income went down to nothing, and you live in an expansion state, which is most of the states, there's a good chance you're going to qualify for medicaid, pollitz said.
does it seem like that doesn't make any sense? that's because it doesn't.
the nuns on the bus are headed to president donald trump's backyard.

before you attack america's teachers again, you should do your homework. the affordable care act was passed by congress. — ken olin (@kenolin1) february 16, 2019
sanders' reluctance to embrace the elimination of the filibuster has puzzled some of his ideological allies. how exactly does the democratic socialist plan to pass his ambitious, politically polarizing agenda ― medicare for all, a $15 per hour minimum wage and free college tuition ― while the filibuster remains in place? (even the most optimistic democrats acknowledge it's unlikely the party has more than 53 senate seats at the start of 2021.)

when trump became president, ryan finally had the opportunity he'd coveted for so long ― a chance to use his blueprint and transform public policy. on taxes he got his way, more or less. although the final bill did not enact many of the changes he desired, it gave enormous new breaks to the very wealthiest americans, while handing only a pittance to the middle class.
a lot of candidates are grappling with this. the single most obvious obstacle to change in 2021 is going to be the filibuster. we're eager to hear people take this on, said leah greenberg, the co-executive director of the liberal grassroots group indivisible, which is pushing for the end the senate's 60-vote requirement for most major pieces of legislation. a policy proposal from a democratic candidate that depends on mitch mcconnell getting behind it is not a real policy proposal.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.), however, was not convinced by mcconnell's assurances that he would hold a vote on an immigration bill in the future.
the trump administration asked the supreme court in june to overturn the full affordable care act, which could end coverage for nearly 23 million americans as well as protections for people like blaque who have preexisting conditions. the president has vowed to use his executive powers to issue an order mandating insurance companies cover all preexisting conditions, falsely saying such action had never been done before.
now the political environment is different. republicans have not given up on repeal, but their assault on the law has made it more popular than ever. meanwhile, the midterm elections are approaching. for the first time since 2010, democrats could have governing majorities in one or even both houses of congress ― and, two years after that, control of the white house as well.
what we are doing is bringing cheap and more affordable options to individuals who are trapped under the affordable care act with insurance that is actually not affordable or not available or doesn't deliver them hospitals and doctors that they need, hhs secretary alex azar said during a fox business network appearance last week.
one way or the other, you're going to talk about them, rep. rob bishop (r-utah) told huffpost on tuesday. obamacare basically is structurally unsound. it's going to have to be fixed at some time. whether it's sooner or later, you're going to have to talk about it.
overall, though, biden delivered a solid performance to the relief of his supporters, who, coming into wednesday's event, said they wanted to see a more aggressive posture in order to demonstrate to voters that the 76-year-old has what it takes to challenge president donald trump.
there he goes again. as mitt romney prepared to enter his new life as a republican senator from utah, he wanted to make sure americans knew he hadn't abandoned his old habit of flip-flopping.
the democratic socialists who make up the policy's most ardent champions saw confirmation that her commitment to achieving single-payer health care is weak at best, while her centrist critics saw a political concession that did nothing to diminish their central problem with her plan.
alaska has an entirely republican delegation in congress. but the state has a strong independent streak that democrats are hoping will come out in their favor if there is a major wave election.

they attend respected universities approved by that sagacious gatekeeper, forbes, and hail from a long list of suburbs that span across the country. in june, they established temporary residence by the hundreds in neighborhoods like greenwich village, turtle bay, murray hill, and the east village - while still more purchased monthly passes for the lirr, nj transit, and metro-north. soon after, they anxiously began orientation programs at banks, media groups, start-ups, designer brands, and non-profits; they received their office ids and their metrocards, and they were told, the city is your playground. and then they got to work.
it's voluntary, said brase. nobody has to join.
hiv among black msm remains a crisis in need of a response. an astonishing one quarter of the approximately 40,000 u.s. residents diagnosed with hiv annually are members of this minority within a minority. (msm as a whole make up two thirds of new diagnoses.)
another question is how long the transition to a new system would take. the draft bill envisions full implementation by 2020, but that's not actually a lot of time for insurers to prepare for what would be an entirely new insurance market. and with the individual mandate coming off the books right away, insurers, who are right now making plans for 2018 and are already worried about covering their costs, might worry about attracting enough healthy customers to make their policies financially sound.
continues to contribute to the worsening of the federal and state budgets by incentivizing states to maintain expansion or to initiate new expansions and leaving the federal government picking up the majority of the bill.
the affordable care act provides two kinds of subsidy to address those issues.
that was it for hearings. after the house bill was introduced nov. 2, 2017, that chamber scheduled no hearings. in 1986, even after its tax reform bill was passed, the house scheduled two more hearings with 131 witnesses. in 2017 the senate didn't hold one hearing on the tax cuts and jobs act after it was introduced. in 1986, after the tax reform act went to the senate, that chamber held 12 hearings with 197 witnesses.
soon, congress — where the gop controlled the senate and the democrats owned the house — was abuzz with hearings on taxation. seventy-one hearings were held in 1985, by 13 different committees, including house banking, small business, public works, and senate energy, and labor. some went on for three, four or five days, and some were held far from the capitol — in oklahoma city, cincinnati, or south bend, indiana, for example. the witness lists were exhaustive: two or three dozen witnesses per hearing were not unusual.

slavitt claimed that he had no illusions about overcoming the political or ideological barriers to universal coverage in congress or donald trump's white house.
the surgeon reduced his portion of the charges — from $32,000 to $4,500, which they thought was reasonable. they asked for a similar break or a payment delay from uva. we are not a lending institution, the billing office told her, she said.
echoing an argument that was especially popular in conservative circles at the time, moore predicted that the affordable care act would have dire effects on employment. companies would force workers to accept fewer hours, he said, or simply keep fewer of them on the payroll. after a 2013 monthly jobs report showed an increase in part-time work, moore on a wsj live segment called it clearly obamacare.
texas gov. greg abbott (r) issued an executive order friday restricting business activity in the state as coronavirus cases in the state continue to soar.
although trump hasn't been able to kill obamacare yet, his administration has taken a number of steps to undermine its programs, as well as medicaid. he declared early in his presidency that he would make the aca fail. on his watch, the uninsured rate has risen and the number of uninsured children is at a decade high.
there are 160 million people who get their insurance through their employer, rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.), sponsor of a bill that would create a government insurance plan but make it voluntary for many people, said earlier this year. you cannot tell them overnight that it is gone.
the trump administration is pretty good at sabotage
the affordable care act returns to the supreme court on tuesday for the third time as republicans continue their efforts to get the judiciary to do what the party has failed to do politically: kill obamacare.
both efforts are a not-so-subtle attempt to lure wary gop voters away from graham just when he needs a unified base to defend his seat. however, several conservative critics of graham are set to endorse him on wednesday in a late move designed to blunt harrison's attacks and defend the gop's majority in the senate.
and even despite trump's intervention, several hundred carrier workers still got laid off. jones said he believed donnelly managed to postpone some of the layoffs, which had been scheduled for last december, until after christmas. the company didn't respond when huffpost asked if that was true.
correction: this article previously stated incorrectly that clinton worked to establish a single-payer system in 1993. her plan was an alternative to a single-payer system, which she viewed as politically inevitable without private-sector reforms.
first, biden promoted his plan, which also would significantly increase the government's role in health coverage by creating a public option to compete with private insurers and would provide much more generous financial assistance to people covered by policies from the affordable care act's health insurance exchanges. unlike sanders' medicare for all plan, however, biden's would leave the private health insurance market intact.
ryan's statement wednesday morning lowers the prospect of passing a clean zika bill. the funding may have to be attached to a measure to keep the government from shutting down after sept. 30. the federal government also estimates it will run out of money to deal with zika by the end of the month if congress does not act.
lynch's most famous vote in congress is likely his one against the affordable care act. but his vote differed from most of the moderate democratic opposition to the landmark health care legislation; lynch said he voted against it because it allowed for private insurance companies to become monopolies and did away with the public option. that vote was a major factor in his 2013 senate primary loss against markey. but in this race, lynch is defending the aca, arguing to expand it instead of working toward a single-payer insurance system, which goldstein supports.
if you continue to expand medicaid, in my opinion, based on the model that we're using now, you're just putting paint on rotten wood, kennedy said.
the final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security.
elehwany, of the national rural health association, said that rural communities where hospitals are forced to close might be able to meet residents' health needs by opening a new urgent care facility or maternal care center.
the people who get little or no assistance can face truly crushing premiums, which is something that republicans have decried and even democrats now admit is the law's biggest shortcoming. in response, democrats have proposed offering more financial assistance, creating a public insurance plan available to anybody who wanted to enroll, or simply eliminating private coverage and having the government insure everybody directly. (slotkin has said she favors the second option, giving people the option to buy into medicare, though she hasn't been terribly specific on details. she also supports having government negotiate directly with drugmakers over prices.)
but it's an imperfect process. and my investment is going to be tiny compared to the rest of the people. what i am going to do is draw attention to it, so the country changes the way it innovates and gets away from its love affair with creating a bunch of innovations that we don't need.
already there's a growing list of progressives who have challenged sitting democrats and prevailed this year: newman beat out lipinski in illinois in march. in missouri, cori bush unexpectedly ousted rep. lacy clay. in new york, jamaal bowman pushed out rep. eliot engel and mondaire jones won an open seat. (the race began as a primary challenge against appropriations committee chairwoman nita lowey, who ultimately decided to retire.)

as proof medicare for all can work, they cite the performance of national health systems in countries such as canada, sweden and taiwan. as proof medicare for all is popular, they cite surveys showing support among u.s. adults reaching 59 percent. but those poll numbers can be misleading. the same surveys show that when people hear about potential costs and trade-offs that come with medicare for all, support falls.
democrats' bare 50-seat majority includes two seats that, under normal circumstances, they would not have had a chance to pry out of gop hands until 2022. the party's coalition — which is heavy on urban residents and racial minorities — is a poor fit for a senate map that gives disproportionate power to rural white voters. overcoming the senate's bias involved hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of working hours on both sides of the political divide, along with some moments of true political savvy — and pure dumb luck.
the farm bureau estimates its policies would cost about 30 percent less than standard healthcare.gov plans, on average, which means a member like franklin really could see his monthly payments go down. but whether a family like his would actually end up saving money in the long run is an open question.

in those southern idaho towns, organizers, volunteers and first-time political candidates got together to carry out an ambitious quest to overrule the elected republicans who run the state and haven't taken action to help the uninsured.
one worker told the investigator she developed mastitis. another chose to pump even though she wasn't given a private space to do it; she did so while standing and facing a wall in the back of the restaurant to try to shield herself. her co-workers covered their eyes when they had to pass her to retrieve supplies, according to the case file.
we all know how good government statistics are. reference the reporting on obamacare. add to it the national debt or the monthly unemployment rate for more reporting wizardry. other estimates put the number at 20 million. the donald wins the contest projecting 30 million illegals. let's go with the official number which is roughly the population of new jersey.
mental health organizations have been expressing concern about how the republican effort to repeal and replace obamacare could affect people living with mental illness. american psychiatric association officials noted that they were not consulted on the house version or the senate's draft legislation.
a white house spokesperson noted that the president has met with various democratic lawmakers to discuss health care policy matters, including a conversation with rep. elijah cummings (d-md.) just last week on the topic of prescription drug prices. but with respect to reforming the current insurance market, the spokesperson made clear that trump's position was resolute.
democrats released yet another proposal for a coronavirus economic relief package on tuesday — a $3 trillion bill with more money for enhanced unemployment benefits, money for state and local governments, and funding for a host of other democratic priorities.
chip somodevilla via getty images at the 2010 affordable care act signing ceremony, vice president joe biden famously told president barack obama that the law was a big fucking deal.
almost without exception, i hear 'thanks' from people, whether they're alaskans or strangers you're passing in an airport somewhere, she said in a monday interview. some thank me for not voting for (kavanaugh). some thank me for just voting my own conscience and not being tied to a party position.
not fighting for the wall becomes a tactical question more than folding, rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), chairman of the freedom caucus, told huffpost on wednesday. you know, when's the best time to take that fight?
research shows that low wages have a major impact on families, and women of color are disproportionately affected. raising the federal minimum wage, as obama has proposed, would increase the salaries of millions of low-wage workers -- most of whom are women.
mcconnell said he will bring up the measure agreed to in conference for a vote later this week. democrats had filibustered it ahead of the july 4th recess. the white house has also said the president would veto it.
if the committee's organizational meeting in late january was any indication, don't expect much.
the supreme court has complete control over its docket, so nothing is ever a slam dunk either way, abbe gluck, a yale law professor who co-wrote a brief against the lawsuit, told huffpost in an email friday. but the states have a strong case here based on many of the criteria for a grant that the court typically uses ― namely, this is an issue of major national importance; at least part of a major federal law has been found unconstitutional; further percolation in the lower court is not necessary because the legal standard and how to apply it are clear; and delaying review will cause serious uncertainty in national economic and regulatory arenas.
the regulation that the administration proposed on tuesday would make it easier for some of these people to get short-term plans, which are generally cheaper because they do not have to follow all of obamacare's rules. they do not have to cover mental health and other essential benefits, for example, and they can have annual or lifetime limits on the bills they will pay.
for the first few seconds of a 1-minute television spot that began airing in alaska in july, it's hard to know for sure.
the gop has utterly abdicated its responsibility to participate in reasoned governance, and so given us donald trump.
five scholars who argued with each other over past legal challenges to the affordable care act have joined forces to file a friend of the court brief about a new lawsuit that could wreck the law.
no one seems to think the skinny repeal will be the bill that president donald trump signs. house conservatives suggested tuesday that they would not simply take this smaller bill. house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) told huffpost there was no appetite to take the senate bill if it were just an expanded executive order. and freedom caucus member rep. raul labrador (r-idaho) said he would have no problem voting no on a bill if it were just a repeal of the individual and employer mandate.
i wouldn't term it an investigation, chaffetz said, but i am curious as to what the gsa plans to do, if anything, about it.
they even have a statement that 'we have to give 10% to the big man,' trump said, referring to words in unverified emails that conservatives claim refer to biden. you're the 'big man,' i think. i don't know ― maybe not ― but you're the 'big man.'
older americans need affordable health care services and prescriptions, aarp executive vice president nancy leamond said in a statement. this plan goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance premiums for older americans and not doing anything to lower drug costs.
4.5 million people either injured or killed in car accidents in 2016. (will lack of health insurance become a leading cause of death?) 14 million patients would be enough to fill to capacity the nation's largest hospital every day with an entirely new set of patients, for over fifteen years. that would new york-presbyterian hospital/weill cornell medical center with about 2300 beds. (when folks don't have health insurance, they rely on the er, which is the most expensive portal into the health care system.)
the law has altered the health care system in countless other ways that a court ruling could undo. these include the prohibition of annual and lifetime caps on benefits, which is something that employer insurance plans once commonly had, and requirements that restaurants provide nutrition information on menus.
now her battle for gender equality is under threat. women stand to lose not only access to abortion but even access to birth control and adequate health care if obamacare is overturned. the right of pregnant women to be free from discrimination at work is not settled, with democratic lawmakers trying to pass better protections. women are still being forced out of work or denied jobs because they're expecting, just as ginsburg was when she was living with her husband in oklahoma after they were first married. recently, progressive employer soulcycle was sued for demoting a pregnant executive and then firing her shortly after she gave birth.
but as each party has become ideological, those opportunities have decreased, and brinkmanship has become as likely as bipartisanship.
it isn't all local, nonpartisan issues. she often stresses the importance of obamacare and criticizes the recent republican tax law.
but the convict still had mekelburg, who was devoted to him. when cortez started serving his sentence at the maximum-security auburn correctional facility in upstate new york, mekelburg told galasso and another now-former friend that she moved into a hotel near the prison. she posted her first tweet during this time ― a picture of a mcdonald's restaurant in auburn, new york, with a childobesity hashtag. siino, meanwhile, moved to los angeles to launch a doomed internet media startup called wemash with quincy jones iii, son of the famous music producer.
we'll see if the cruz strategy works.
let's be willing to reform obamacare rather than just say, 'oh, no, no, we can't touch this because it's perfect and we're not willing to make changes,' he said. ironically, why romneycare was more popular than obamacare in massachusetts is because democrats and republicans worked together to reform it time and time again, year after year in the state legislature.
he said democrats want to defund the police. biden, again, doesn't, has rejected that.
he believes in more free stuff. you can't give him enough free stuff. as long as somebody else is paying for it, he'll take a dozen of them, kennedy said. i don't mean any disrespect, but i've know john bel for a long time. i'm not interested in more free stuff. we can't afford more free stuff.
a democratic campaign strategist was a little more blunt about how this document could hurt republicans in tough districts.
as i have watched the solemn yet brave march of women in hollywood, the media, politics, the arts, in academia, in the sports world and corporate america stepping forward to proclaim #metoo. what has not been lost on me are the number of liberal or progressive white men they are accusing, very powerful white men, who have raped and molested and harassed and discriminated against or alienated so many of these women.
as usual, president donald trump is either ignorant or lying about his own policies. this time, it's so ridiculously obvious that correcting the record might sound fake.
voters in some other parts of this country would probably find such vows familiar.
one is jacklindy barradez, a housekeeper and restaurant worker unemployed since the start of the pandemic. her husband hung on to his maintenance job, but the couple and their two children are uninsured. barradez said a friend told her about the health law and she intends to follow through.
the democratic campaign arm touted the strong fundraising performance, including the online figures, as evidence that the backlash to president donald trump is lifting democratic fortunes.
polling in recent weeks has shown a solid top trio of biden, warren and sanders, with harris and south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg ― both of whom had stints in the top tier ― falling into the single digits. the fact that warren and biden, who have clashed in the past, were sharing the debate stage for the first time only increased expectations of a showdown.
sanders discussed his plan in an interview with huffpost on saturday, stating, i do think that every piece of legislation that i am fighting for can be passed with good legislative processes, including budget reconciliation.
lynch's campaign brushed off the idea.
after the justice department notified the 5th circuit of its support for striking the entire law, a wall street journal editorial warned republicans against pursuing a legal strategy that is likely to fail and could blow up politically.
the case sanders made for medicare for all is essentially the same kucinich made years ago during his presidential campaign, the difference being that sanders has earned the right to have his ideas taken seriously, and did a lot of the work to force those ideas into the mainstream.

trump's hhs seems to be jumping at yet another opportunity to undercut the aca's effort to structure a fair, functioning marketplace for individual insurance, jon kingsdale, a former massachusetts state health care official, told huffpost after reading the initial reports. on top of a half-dozen other hits to the aca marketplace, this will add to health plans' anxieties about getting stuck with a deteriorating risk pool.
the bill also provides states $100 billion over 10 years to establish high-risk pools or other mechanisms to support people with high medical costs.
two days after the election, i crumpled over in yoga class, reeling from chest pain. after googling the symptoms — soreness around my heart, difficulty breathing, numbness in my left arm — i took myself to the emergency room. there i was diagnosed with costochondritis, which sounded (and seemed) like a fancy form of hypochondria, but is in fact a swelling of the cartilage around the sternum brought on by anxiety.
mcconnell could also get a helping hand from the senate parliamentarian, as she'll have to rule on whether cruz's open-ended language on coverage options is actually allowable in a reconciliation bill, which requires only 50 votes to pass but limits what senators can do in order to reconcile spending with their budget. while striking down the cruz language could be the death blow for the health care bill, it could also convince cruz and other conservatives ― like mike lee (r-utah) ― to accept a more incremental approach.

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has made clear that he has no plans to take up broad health care legislation until after the 2020 election. (he said so after trump, seemingly out of nowhere, pledged earlier this year that republicans will become known as the party of health care.)

cassidy, who said he was undecided on the obamacare repeal currently before the senate, drew praise for what some consider his moderate views on health care, including his vow to make sure any legislation passes the jimmy kimmel test. that refers to kimmel's viral plea for government-assured care for babies with preexisting conditions which the late night talk show host made after his newborn suffered a heart scare.
now the people know they can vote. they may not be able to vote in this campaign right here, but there's one coming up in november and we can get many more registered for the next election, bookhart said.

chief justice john roberts was an instrumental force behind a 2012 supreme court decision to protect obamacare but shifted his opinions on several key components of the health care law behind the scenes in the months leading up to the monumental decision, ultimately weakening the law in one critical place, according to an upcoming book about his life.
and that's what happened in 2009 and 2010 ― even if lawmakers ended up talking too much about some fake issues (like death panels) and not enough about some real ones (like how new regulations would affect existing insurance plans). the process gave everybody a long time to contemplate reform and what it would mean.

it's a tricky balance for planned parenthood, and some other progressive groups: if collins loses but the gop retains control of the senate, an anti-abortion republican would likely take her place on the help committee. and collins is also next in line to chair the powerful appropriations committee. but if there's a chance to defeat collins and get a more reliable democrat in the chamber, isn't it worth it?
we do offer an exceptional pension program, however, and we take the entire month of august off (october, too, in even-numbered years). we also typically designate one week a month as a district work period, whatever that means.
stock buybacks inflate the value of a company's shares by reducing the amount of stock available to the public. cash devoted to repurchasing shares isn't invested in research or development, and goosing share values lines executives' pockets, since they are often paid with stock and receive bonuses according to its value.
honestly, that's a hurtful feeling due to the fact that my voice matters, shealy said when huffpost informed him of the voter law. i can't really express or show my interest due to the fact that i don't have the card. so in so many words, excuse my language, that's fucked up.

connecticut also joined seven other states in passing a scheduled minimum wage increase to $15 per hour by 2023. the state's current minimum wage is $10.10 — almost $3.00 higher than the federal minimum wage requirement — but lawmakers felt it wasn't enough.

we always believed that we could shock the world, brewer told huffpost on wednesday. but it was still kind of shocking when we did it.

obamacare participants have to choose the best type of plan to minimize out-of-pocket costs -- comparing deductibles, share of copayments, list of physicians and hospitals, and whether prescription drugs are covered. it's a choice that must be made again every year as your eligibility changes and as the insurers that offer the programs change pricing or drop out of offering coverage.

hillary clinton herself doubled down on her daughter's comments on abc news thursday morning, and campaign aides have done the same. of course, this is not true. under a single-payer system, everybody gets health care. that's the entire point, as hillary clinton well knows. chelsea clinton knows it too. as alex pareene points out: chelsea clinton has a masters degree in public health from columbia. she knows exactly how what she's saying obfuscates the issue.

so for truvada to make the greatest possible impact on hiv rates, its use as prevention would need to reach a critical mass among at-risk black msm. instead, prep has increasingly found its niche among white msm, a demographic that has already long benefited from a dropping hiv diagnosis rate, to the tune of an 18 percent decline between 2005 and 2014. during that time, diagnoses among black msm rose 22 percent, with an 87 percent surge among young black msm. (in promising news, however, the hiv rate among black msm, including youths, has leveled off in more recent years.)

trump may prefer that democrats take further heat for obamacare's problems. but his voters don't want this can to be kicked down the road any further, and they want the terrific replacement promised to them.
in an op-ed for the washington post earlier this week, romney accused president donald trump of not having risen to the mantle of the office, of showing a shortfall in character and leadership, and of words and actions that have caused dismay around the world.
conservatives have been holding back support, because, they say, the repeal bill leaves too much of obamacare intact. and a big focus of their anger has been the law's regulations on what insurance covers ― which, by and large, the original version of repeal legislation left intact.
jordan noted that some republicans are pushing to keep the obamacare taxes in place. others are pushing for a longer delay to the date of enactment. and still others are trying to keep planned parenthood funding in the health care law. these are all ideas that are anathema to conservatives.
u.s. district judge reed o'connor ruled in favor of the lawsuit, but his decision has drawn strong criticism ― even from conservative experts who think it makes no sense to cite congressional intent about the mandate from 2010 when, in 2017, congress clearly felt differently.
khn focused on district cases that were warrant in debt cases and circuit cases that were complaint — catch-all or contract action. uva sues to recover patient debt from all three categories. for cases brought by the university of virginia, the plaintiff names (as entered by the court) vary widely: university of virginia, rectors and visitors of uva or just uva are some examples. we included cases that mentioned the uva physicians group and health services foundation (although these were much less prevalent). in some cases, the uva medical center was named specifically; in others, it was not. khn analyzed cases brought by the university whether or not the case specifically mentioned the medical center, knowing that some cases omit this detail. we took a random sample of 30 warrant in debt cases from the albemarle district court in 2017 that were filed by rectors and visitors but did not specify the medical center. we looked up the original records at the courthouse; each one was related to the medical center.
it would be particularly helpful, several experts added, if the new payment system included reforms that could reward hospitals that actually focus on keeping patients healthier ― again, expanding on efforts already underway through the affordable care act. one state, maryland, is already trying that and jayapal's bill calls for a similar approach.
democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg introduced a health care plan thursday designed to cover nearly everybody and make insurance less expensive for people who have it already, through a combination of expanded government subsidies, limits on medical prices and a new public option.
steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has spent tens of millions of dollars boosting democrats in the past several election cycles. his push to gather support for impeaching president donald trump has rankled democratic leadership.
similar risks exist for people who opt for other alternatives, like christian health sharing ministries and the farm bureau plans sold in iowa and tennessee.
unaffordable coverage is still a big problem for many
there's been a lot of attention on the state's senate race, which is between sen. dan sullivan (r) and al gross, an independent candidate aligned with democrats. if energy around that race holds, it might trickle down to the state's only house member, rep. don young, the 87-year-old republican who is seeking his 25th term representing alaska's at-large district.
one question looming over all of this is how these features could become law. in order to advance legislation in the senate, where it would normally take 60 votes to overcome a democratic filibuster, republicans hope to use the budget reconciliation process, in which a simple majority can pass a bill.
in 2009, grassley helped fuel the false idea that obamacare would create death panels to determine patients' end-of-life care.
we're now in a position where we are working with county officials and advising them to pull back and once again reinstitute their stay-at-home orders, newsom said, adding, if they're not able to come to some consensus, i am committed to intervening.
other democratic moderates huffpost talked to on tuesday were cautious about supporting free testing and treatment, particularly when it was framed as a form of socialized medicine. but they weren't necessarily opposed. rep. jim cooper (d-tenn.) said the key thing was to keep our hospitals afloat, and rep. joe cunningham (d-s.c.) refused to side one way or the other without knowing more details.
it's my hope and belief that the supreme court won't strike the law down, collins said.
we're going to be looking at the uninsured to see if we can help them out, trump said tuesday, potentially referring to this idea.
calling people to ask for money
medicare for all is a solution favored by the activist left for the way in which it would supplant for-profit insurance with a plan akin to what seniors currently enjoy that is free, or nearly free, at the point of service.
trump's other big medicaid initiative was to allow states to impose burdensome work requirements on some medicaid enrollees, despite the fact that the vast majority of those who are physically able to work already are employed. sixteen states have asked for permission to set up work requirements since 2018. courts have thus far blocked work requirements in several states and others have postponed implementation, so no one currently is subject to these requirements.
then we come to the latest legal challenge, which appears to be as rigorously considered as a snotty facebook comment.
but washington is so comprehensively toxic that even people who recognize its problems can still be shaped by them. the porter episode matters not for any lasting policy consequences, but for the way it fits into a broader pattern of behavior from democratic leaders and their troubling approach to governing in the era of donald trump.
in oral arguments, both chief justice john roberts and associate justice brett kavanaugh expressed skepticism about a key argument in the lawsuit ― specifically, that if one part of the obamacare law is unconstitutional, then the entire law has to come off the books.
but those optics aren't likely to fool many people, she said.
an extreme agenda ― and an unpopular one
when welker asked trump to explain his contingency plan for insuring americans who could lose their health care coverage if the supreme court sides with the trump administration in its effort to overturn the affordable care act, trump had no real answers.
on his way out, pawlenty greets the media. the republican party has shifted. it is the era of trump and i'm just not a trump-like politician. asked whether he is done with politics, he says the answer is yes. — eric roper (@stribroper) august 15, 2018
ripple effects on the insurance market
at some point, democrats will also have to confront divisions within their own ranks. some conservative democrats cannot accept a system in which government provides everybody, or even most people, with insurance. some liberal democrats cannot accept a system in which for-profit insurers still have a significant role. those two views are fundamentally incompatible.
in the calvary chapel dayton valley decision last month, the supreme court rejected a nevada church's emergency plea to strike down the state's temporary 50-person cap on worship services.
it's more important than ever that democrats win at least one chamber of congress in november and put the brakes on trump's agenda, which each day causes more chaos and harm.
trump's other big promises from the 2016 campaign — a grand infrastructure overhaul not seen since the 1950s and the replacement of obamacare with an even better health care program — haven't materialized.
more than 70 million people in the united states were covered by medicaid as of december, according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services. about 30 million potentially could be subject to the new trump limits on the program's funding, according to the henry j. kaiser family foundation.
the outreach to moderate republicans and disaffected trump voters was carried on from the first night of the convention, which featured elected gop officials as well as personal stories from republican voters who were switching their party affiliation this election.
the hypocrisy from president trump and republicans when it comes to preexisting conditions protections is just stark. my republican colleagues know that these plans cover next to nothing for those who get sick and are often completely unaffordable to the average family, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said tuesday.
according to a recent pew research center survey of democratic voters, 53% said they want their party to move in a more moderate direction, while 40% said they preferred a more liberal approach. though some of the high-profile members of the new house democratic majority are liberals such as new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, the party overtook republicans on the backs of moderates who ousted republicans in white, working-class districts.
biden, who would bring decades of legislative experience to the white house, prides himself on his political intuition. and insofar as he thought pursuing health care reform in 2009 and 2010 would have negative political repercussions, he was probably right. the effort soaked up resources the obama administration could have spent elsewhere. the party-line vote made the law easier to attack. the backlash hurt democrats in the midterms.
the parameters of the health care debate looked a lot different a decade ago. back then, democrats still had deep scars from the clinton administration's failed effort at comprehensive reform in the 1990s. for years after that, they had focused on proposing more limited undertakings, like regulating managed care companies or helping seniors to pay for drugs.
keeping the same policy and paying the full premium may make sense for unemployed people who can afford it, she said. for example, a pregnant woman may not want to switch policies and doctors prior to giving birth, or a person in the middle of medical treatments may prefer to have continuity of care.
and leave leslie jones the hell alone.
the investigative subcommittee shall have jurisdiction to determine whether representative patrick meehan and/or his former chief of staff, mr. brian schubert, who is currently employed by another house office, engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment, retaliation, or misuse of official resources, in violation of house rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct, the house ethics committee said tuesday in a statement.
shorter delays could be consequential as well, leida said, because industry officials are already negotiating with state regulators over next year's rates. insurers aren't supposed to adjust premiums in the future to adjust for past gains or losses, but they use past risk adjustment payments as a way to calibrate projections of who they will enroll next year.
tony evers, the democratic nominee for governor, was also there.
on the other hand, the nyha plan would simplify billing and administration, in part because doctors and hospitals wouldn't have to spend time communicating and haggling with private insurers. that would tend to reduce costs.
under the new rules that hhs released last week, insurers can go back to selling short-term plans that last for (nearly) one year and, in a new twist, they'll be able to let consumers renew those plans twice. if insurers decide to offer such policies, consumers could then hold short term coverage for what basically works out to three years. they wouldn't even have to worry about the individual mandate, because, thanks to the gop tax bill that trump signed late last year, the penalty falls to zero in 2019.
travis washington, 51, veteran with disabilities
but it's virtually certain that no major expansions are going to happen in washington for the next two years because republicans still control the senate and the white house. their agenda has focused for years on scaling back federal and state programs that provide assistance to low- and middle-income families and would lead to millions fewer americans covered.
also running are former state house speaker margaret anderson kelliher, who has extensive legislative experience and often clashed with the republican governor, and state sen. patricia torres rey, the first latina woman to serve in the minnesota senate. less experienced candidates include activist jamal abdulahi and frank drake, both of whom have never held office.

by shedding those services, the hospitals diminish their reason for existing, said maggie elehwany, head of government affairs and policy for the national rural health association.
despite bogus protestations to the contrary, the trump administration did indeed have a child separation policy, and it was indeed intended to provoke such shock and trauma that no family from any shithole country would dare set foot in america again.
progressives have been pushing for the idea to get a serious hearing in the new york state legislature, now that democrats finally have full control. so far, that hasn't happened.
how hard is it to be this voluntarily stupid?? #congresspassedobamacare https://t.co/tirmodn9rs — mike avila (@mikeavila) february 15, 2019
still, some people lost plans they liked, and others lost access to beloved providers because alternative plans didn't include them in their networks. nobody ever figured out how many people fell into these categories, but it was probably in the low millions, which is significant even if it's just a small percentage of the total population.
that seems to be the consensus from progressives in congress.
the trump administration official who testified tuesday ― robert kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at hhs ― said the government could treat coronavirus victims as federal disaster patients, and therefore pay hospitals for their care at an above-medicare rate.
despite the location, not everyone at the town hall was a democrat.
his idea, he said was to give lawmakers a little taste of the fear his constituents feel when they hear about zika spreading in their neighborhoods while congress has failed since february to approve any funding to combat the mosquito-borne virus.
but anthem and cigna disagreed about the deal in court, jackson wrote in her order, with cigna refusing to sign off on anthem's interpretation of how the companies could garner savings.
a republican senator gave his colleagues a lesson in the birds and the bees on wednesday as he pressed them to keep maternity benefits in all health care plans.
washington ― the trump white house is done negotiating over repealing and replacing obamacare, senior officials said thursday night, and republicans are moving ahead with a vote on their bill friday, even though they seem to lack enough support for passage and recalcitrant conservatives and moderates continued talking.
but whatever the insurers and state officials decide, the plans are likely to prove popular in some parts of the country and for some consumers.
these two programs are jointly operated and financed by the federal government and the states, and there are different benefits and income limits among the states. but medicaid generally is for people with very low incomes ― which would include jobless people who abruptly find themselves with no income at all except for unemployment insurance.
the democratic proposal would allow more solid middle-class households to qualify for financial help. on the opposite end of the scale, those who've experienced unemployment would qualify for extra-generous subsidies.
tax cuts seem to be where republicans are focusing their energy and pinning their 2018 hopes.

dr. saul levin, the association's ceo and medical director, on thursday blasted the senate proposal as represents a significant move in the wrong direction, resulting in fewer people having access to insurance, fewer patient protections, and less coverage for essential behavioral health care.
but quite unlike gingrich, who was famous for his rhetorical and stylistic intemperance, ryan cultivated an image as a calm, serious thinker ― and as a candid one, too. over and over again ryan warned of a debt crisis and, sometimes, blamed previous gop congressional leaders for their complicity in making deficits bigger during the presidency of george w. bush.
fischer emphasized that so far, the party hasn't yet increased its advertising in the new year; all these new folks are finding their way on their own. people are walking in off the street every day and asking how to get involved.
mcsally went on to accuse sinema of lying ― three separate times. but mcsally was the one rewriting history.
do they fully understand what happened that day? will they ever? can they? said ryan, who recalled how he couldn't get a flight home and had to drive.
enrollment in those old noncompliant plans was bound to dwindle eventually, as people found different sources of coverage, either through new jobs or, perhaps, reaching the age to qualify for medicare. now that isn't going to happen. instead, a new class of cheap, noncompliant plans will be open to new enrollees. the policies will likely draw people in good health away from the policies available on healthcare.gov, driving premiums there even higher. (it may or may not be sheer coincidence that wellmark will operate the new plans, too.)
the thrust of biden's actual health care plan is to retain the public-private structure of the affordable care act's health insurance marketplaces and the health care system at large while adding new benefits and stronger financial assistance to make coverage more affordable and accessible. the proposals are very similar to 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton's platform and to health care plans promoted by centrist democrats in congress, the state level and the 2020 presidential field. obama himself endorsed a similar slate of proposals in 2016, although he more recently praised medicare for all.
from march 11-13, huffpost traveled across southern idaho along the path of the snake river from idaho falls to boise with stops in between in pocatello and twin falls.
it is the second time the justices addressed the question of religious accommodations to the contraception provision in the healthcare law signed by trump's democratic predecessor barack obama. in 2016, the justices sidestepped a decision on previous rules issued by the obama administration, sending the dispute back to lower courts.
a legal challenge to the affordable care act went before a panel of three federal judges on tuesday and got a credulous, sympathetic-sounding hearing from the two judges who were appointed by republicans.
the experts are saying it's highly unlikely they'll overturn the aca, sen. steve daines (r-mont.) said in a debate earlier this week, but daines, who is facing a strong challenge from montana gov. steve bullock (d), voted on thursday against cutting off doj's support for the anti-obamacare lawsuit.
hans leida of milliman, the global actuarial firm based in minneapolis, echoed these concerns. he told huffpost that a long suspension in payments could be catastrophic for an insurer that is in a weak financial position and needs the cash. maybe it's just a delay of [payments] that will eventually happen, and as an insurer in theory you know you will come out whole, but that assumes you have enough money to keep operating.
with medicaid reductions and smaller tax credits, there's no way the house gop bill covers as many people as the aca. — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) march 7, 2017
right, but it takes time to build a political movement. so people have a rallying flag [in medicare for all] they think is very exciting to people, and they see that laying the groundwork for a whole variety of different things.
the supreme court fight will also force republicans to start talking about health care more in the months before the midterm elections ― something they don't seem all that excited to do. gop spending on tv ads mentioning obamacare has plummeted compared with previous election cycles, while democratic spending is up slightly. democrats also consistently say it's their top issue for the midterms.
in jorjani's thursday hearing before the senate energy and natural resources committee, sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) called the comment particularly troubling.
my few friends who support hillary clinton seem to be confused by my many friends who support bernie sanders. the following are the five questions hillary fans seem most befuddled by:
colorado will now offer free full-day kindergarten starting in the 2019-20 school year ― one of polis' top priorities. the full-day kindergarten plan still depends on individual districts switching their programming from a half day to full day, though many have already said they plan to.
trump: all of my employees are having a tremendous problem with obamacare. — reid j. epstein (@reidepstein) october 25, 2016
but, as a whole, biden's proposal would represent one of the largest expansions of health coverage in american history.
more generous subsidies would mean more federal spending. dramatically cutting revenues for any health care industry group would cause closures and job losses, potentially making it harder for patients to get care. pushing everybody into public insurance would force some to give up private insurance they like.
hirono pushed kavanaugh on his relationship with federal court judge alex kozinski, who has been accused of making sexually inappropriate comments to female clerks and lower-level staff members and showing them pornography on his office computer. kavanaugh insisted he had no knowledge of the allegations before they were reported publicly.
leading legal scholars ― including those who were central to bringing the previous lawsuits against the affordable care act ― think this lawsuit is nonsense.
that same scenario could play out again. even if the panel from the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals rules against the affordable care act, the supreme court could easily uphold the law on appeal.
obamacare is a highly explosive issue the supreme court could be asked to review for a third time in the near future. trump's justice department has said it will not defend the law against pending challenges from the states. officials from 20 republican-controlled states argued in a texas court on wednesday that the law should be invalidated entirely because its individual mandate had been repealed by the gop tax law last year.
it's easy enough to assess the affordable care act's impact in michigan. the law took full effect in early 2014, and over the next two years, the share of michigan's population without health insurance fell from 11 percent to 6.5 percent. that's based on 2015 census data, so the percentage is probably even lower now. whatever the case, that's a lot of people who now have access to health care and protection from sometimes crippling medical bills.
people who contract the most serious cases of covid-19 face extensive recovery time. it can take seven days in rehab for every one day spent on a ventilator to recover, and not every patient regains the same level of function.
tipirneni is benefiting from the enthusiasm and mobilization of the district's democratic voters, particularly suburban women, in the wake of trump's election.
of course, that similarity could be a strength or a weakness or maybe some of both, depending on your perspective.
i'm sure there are republicans and independents who can't imagine crossing over to support a democrat, kasich said. they fear joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. i don't believe that because i know the measure of the man. … no one pushes joe around.
but it's not yet clear whether the group will endorse gideon, or another collins challenger, as a forceful message of disillusionment with the senator. it's been widely reported that the organization backed collins in 2002, but planned parenthood action fund said it never endorsed her, although it did give her $5,000 for the campaign. so there was support, but not a formal endorsement. it then endorsed her democratic challenger in 2008, and stayed neutral in her 2014 race.
before that, the bbc notes, the record high occurred on april 24, with 36,400 new cases, though testing was not as frequent at that point.
she was devastated when harris dropped out of the race. she hadn't made up her mind yet on who she'd be voting for, but it hurt to see the california senator drop out before iowa. she had also paid close attention to booker's campaign.
last year, the average cost of job-based health benefits for a single person was almost $600 a month and more than $1,700 for family coverage, according to a kaiser family foundation survey. employers cover an average of almost 80% of that premium for single workers and 70% of it for family coverage. but once you're on cobra, that gets significantly more expensive.
the majority-democratic new york assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state senate ― then controlled by republicans ― didn't take up the measure. democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although gov. andrew cuomo (d) has expressed skepticism.
while trump has claimed over the years that he is both successful and smart, his decades-long record suggests quite the opposite.
legal scholars from the left and right have derided the plaintiffs' legal arguments, but one federal circuit court judge and two appeals court jurists were unmoved by those criticisms so far. these republican-appointed judges also were unpersuaded by the democratic defense of the law, including the assertion that congress clearly didn't intend to repeal the entire law when it eliminated the mandate fines in 2017, as evidenced by the fact that congress did not, in fact, vote to repeal the entire law.
but trump didn't just run his campaign on renegotiating trade agreements. he promised that his trade policies would actually revive the american manufacturing job market.
finally, new york passed one of the most ambitious climate bills in the country and is waiting on a signature from cuomo. the bill would set a goal to have the state run on 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and economy-wide, net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
but that line also meant democrats hadn't already seen enough to move forward. they downplayed the evidence that was in the report themselves, when in reality there was plenty of damning evidence released in mueller's report.
obamacare tax repeals: the released bill, in general, delays the repeal of obamacare taxes by one year compared to the february 10 draft. the bill does not appear to repeal the economic substance doctrine.
the department of health and human services reported tuesday that enrollment on the exchanges for this year, which ends jan. 31, is ahead of where it was at this time last year. the ratings agency standard & poor's reported last month that the financial status of health insurers participating in the exchanges is improving ― after many suffered losses last year ― and projected that these marketplaces and the prices consumers pay will stabilize in the future.
the notion that you could gut the entire aca and not wreak havoc on the lives of millions of people is insane, nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor and expert on the health care law, wrote in a quick reaction article at the incidental economist website. the act is now part of the plumbing of the health-care system.
an undecided voter confronted us president donald trump over his efforts to repeal the affordable care act during a town hall event on tuesday, asking how the white house planned to protect those with preexisting conditions while actively fighting to undermine protections already in place.
in the same article, barrett criticized another ruling upholding the health care law on the grounds that, once again, roberts misinterpreted the law in order to prop it up. in 2012, barnett signed a petition protesting a provision of the affordable care act guaranteeing coverage of birth control, arguing that it violates religious liberty.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and other backers of single-payer, medicare for all plans maintain that eliminating the for-profit health insurance industry and guaranteeing all u.s. residents generous, lifelong health coverage is the best and most equitable way to ensure that everyone has access to doctors, hospitals, and prescription drugs at minimal out-of-pocket cost.
medicare goes away as you know it. all the medicare you have is gone. former vice president joe biden
there are, however, complications inextricably bound to the whims and desires of donald trump, who sees the matter in vastly different terms and, more often than one would prefer, communicates his desires in brief twitter outbursts. where republican lawmakers want to act in accordance with their conservative philosophies, trump operates strictly from the perspective of someone who wants to be loved and acclaimed, and who has won a healthy share of this acclaim largely through his masterful command of the p.r. of the moment. at bottom, trump craves good publicity, and he's starting to see the upcoming health care fight as something that might deny him that pleasure.
that doesn't mean enrollment would be compulsory. even those people subject to automatic enrollment into medicaid or the public option could choose a different plan or opt out of coverage altogether.

yet another element of michigan's success may be the way doctors and hospitals have responded to these demands ― and the way they've adapted in a market where the people paying for care (not just insurers, but employers and unions as well) have for years pushed for more efficient ways of delivering medical care.
trump's remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way nato works.
feminism is not about any one woman's success; it's about all of us being freed from discrimination and oppression: not just professional white women, but trans women, gay women, poor women, immigrant women, black and brown women. feminism is even interested in doing this for men, who are also burdened by toxic expectations and limitations.

icer works through three independent review bodies of practicing physicians, methodology experts and patient advocates that meet three times a year in new england, the midwest and california to look at the evidence for the effectiveness of new treatments or drugs. i was a consumer member of the california panel, ctaf (california technology assessment forum) for many years, so i know how challenging it is to integrate a non-clinical voice in the decision-making. the issues are complex and the information is often incomplete or highly technical. however, patients or consumers can bring a practical focus to the discussion, especially when we try to define terms such as quality of life or question the value of a drug that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and extends life by only a few weeks.
a viable, non-obamacare health care solution is hard to propose because emotion, philosophical bias, and lack of familiarity with the facts keep getting in the way.

barrett, if confirmed, is expected to participate in arguments on nov. 10 in a case in which trump and republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the affordable care act. the 2010 healthcare law, also known as obamacare, has helped millions of americans obtain medical insurance and barred private insurers from denying medical coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

obama's answers to the country's worsening economic inequality -- the affordable care act, pushing for a higher minimum wage, proposing tax credits for child care expenses -- could have a significant impact on working families.
in 2011, trump claimed that he had sent investigators to hawaii to look into obama's birth certificate and that they cannot believe what they're finding. none of that was true, but his enthusiastic support for the birther conspiracy theory helped make him an early favorite in the 2016 republican primaries.
it's hard to say, he said. one day he's one way, the next day he's the other way.

huffington post reporter jeffrey young contributed to this report.
the trump administration has shown it's not going to be cowed by lawsuits and bad court results, however, as it can appeal to the supreme court, where the president feels he can get more favorable treatment.
surveys show that most enrollees in the affordable care act marketplaces are happy with their plans. the trump voters in our focus groups were representative of people who had not fared as well. several described their frustration with being forced to change plans annually to keep premiums down, losing their doctors in the process. but asked about policies found in several republican plans to replace the affordable care act — including a tax credit to help defray the cost of premiums, a tax-preferred savings account and a large deductible typical of catastrophic coverage — several of these trump voters recoiled, calling such proposals not insurance at all. one of those plans has been proposed by representative tom price, mr. trump's nominee to be secretary of health and human services. these voters said they did not understand health savings accounts and displayed skepticism about the concept. when told mr. trump might embrace a plan that included these elements, and particularly very high deductibles, they expressed disbelief. they were also worried about what they called chaos if there was a gap between repealing and replacing obamacare. but most did not think that, as one participant put it, a smart businessman like trump would let that happen.
but so far, that measure ― which was supposed to be the highlight of the gop legislative agenda ― isn't resonating as much as the party would have liked. toward the end of the heated special election in pennsylvania's 18th congressional district last month, republicans largely abandoned ads touting their signature piece of legislation.

once 60% of the population, especially the adult population, becomes immune, we expect that effective reproductive rate to go under 1, which basically means the virus will still be around, it will still circulate, but its chain of transmission has been interrupted, shabir madhi, a professor of vaccinology involved in the trial, told reuters.
according to local news reports, hundreds of people packed the small room, bringing signs and chanting do your job, your last term, and work for us.
after trump and ryan decided to pull the bill on friday afternoon, the president continued to lambaste the freedom caucus for undermining the republican agenda.
the american health care system is an expensive, sprawling mess. the republican party's brightest idea for how to fix it? make health insurance worse.
for later years, the disparities only become greater.
like many campaign proposals, the harris plan is more a framework than a point-by-point proposal, with many unanswered questions about the transition, the financing, and other vital matters. even so, the material from harris contains enough information to convey the general approach she has in mind and how it compares with the plans from rival candidates.
the polling, which the democratic firm gbao conducted on behalf of the pccc's think tank arm, the progressive change institute, as well as business for medicare for all and public citizen, examined rebuttals to critiques of medicare for all that emphasized it would abolish private insurance. in the survey, two-thirds of voters continued to favor medicare for all when an attack noting that it would eliminate private health insurance was rebutted either by reminding voters that the change would be gradual or that it would give americans a lifetime of portable insurance regardless of their employment status.
we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic, pence said, citing the obama administration ― and then-vice president joe biden's ― response to the 2009 swine flu.
certain medicaid populations would be exempt from the rules, including those with disabilities, the elderly, children and pregnant women. verma also said states would have to make reasonable modifications for those battling opioid addiction and other substance use disorders.
why hasn't it come already? asked colbert.
economists across the political spectrum have long called for such a change, and the affordable care act actually has a version of this proposal, known as the cadillac tax. but the idea of taxing health benefits is highly unpopular, which is one reason congress voted two years ago to postpone introduction of the cadillac tax.
rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.) praised americans who raised their voices in opposition to the gop bill.
baldwin told huffpost she thought it was pretty great that trump touted the legislation, which she told the president about when she first met him. but she's skeptical anything more will happen on his side.
in those 12 states that refused the medicaid expansion, nearly 2 million low-income adults without children at home likely qualify for nothing.
but that doesn't mean it's impossible, and the health and financial risks of being uninsured make it wise to explore different ways to find coverage.
later, trump boasted about his passage of the first step act, a bipartisan bill that expands job training in prisons and gives judges greater discretion in sentencing. he attacked biden for his passage of the 1994 crime bill, which progressive critics blame for an explosion in prison and jail populations.
that potential showdown is all the more reason some republicans are floating the idea of working with democrats on new legislation.
so did more than 200 patient advocacy organizations, labor unions and nonprofits in a letter to vice president mike pence, centers for medicare and medicaid services administrator seema verma and azar. rep. lloyd doggett (d-texas) and sen. bob casey (d-penn.) authored legislation to force a special enrollment period, but it has not advanced.
my deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of senator john mccain. our hearts and prayers are with you! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) august 26, 2018
biden delivered an impassioned denial of any suggestion that he had profited from ties to foreign companies or governments. i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life, he said.
it's really not debatable at this point how it plays politically, said teixeira, who has not endorsed anyone in the primary. people are very risk averse.

a lot of my community are elderly folks, retirees. for them, medicare and social security are their lifelines, tipirneni said. these are earned benefits that they have paid into through decades of hard work.
regardless of who eventually wins in this cautionary tale, from a treatment perspective it does not have a happy ending. given the system's incentives, the prospect of continued insurance payments likely influenced the therapist to continue treatments without evaluating their effectiveness. for the patient, the belief that the treatments were covered by insurance allowed him to hope that they would eventually improve his condition. alas, they did not. the treatments were a waste of time; and now so are countless hours he is spending to secure payment for the provider.
there are now few states to which the gop can send trump ― who, on his own, is deciding where he wants to go anyway ― because even if he may help in a statewide race, he will hurt gop house candidates in suburban districts in that same state who are running as far away from him as they can. as has been said many times, anything trump touches, he destroys.
the crowd roared with approval ― partly because you can't really go wrong denouncing obamacare at a trump rally, and partly, one assumes, because some michiganders are genuinely angry about how the affordable care act is playing out in their state.
the republicans are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than obamacare, he tweeted. vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate & win back the house.
once he had won the nomination, romney immediately tacked to the center, boasting of his moderate credentials and pledging to be a bipartisan leader as president. political commentators noted that most candidates sought to convey to voters a set of core beliefs in their bids for public office. those things don't seem to matter to mitt romney, the new york times editorialized at the time.
here you can compare costs and coverage of medicare supplement plans (called medigap plans) -- and find the ones that are available in your zip code. all supplement plans are standardized, with varying levels of coverage -- so that's your first decision. or there's an all-in-one medicare advantage program. then click to see which insurers provide plans in your area.
the buttigieg campaign did not provide a detailed cost estimate for its own plan, but an adviser told huffpost that buttigieg would finance the program through a combination of corporate tax reform and, as time wore on, savings from a more efficient health care system.
you talk about states experimenting with this stuff, but congress seems like a totally different animal.
one view supports the basic impulse of universal health care that everybody should have access to relatively generous coverage regardless of income or pre-existing conditions, even if that requires more regulation, government spending and taxes. the other view holds that less government is always preferable to more and that ultimately, people will be better off shopping for whatever coverage insurers see fit to offer on their own.
medicare for america would also limit health care spending, by restricting what doctors and hospitals could charge for services. on prescription drugs, medicare for america would have the federal government negotiate directly with manufacturers and then license drugs to competitors when negotiations break down ― in effect, taking away the patent protections that allow drug companies to charge such high prices.
but it was jackson, missouri, that came in last on the list at number 78, with average home values sitting at $62,800 and a salary of at least $43,265 (91% of the state median) required to take out a loan.
and still more? gutting programs that seek to recognize the impact of race and class, often because they are deemed unfair to far more advantaged whites. tolerating a relentless disparagement of our president that reeks of racism -- imagine, if you will, the outcry if a black congressman had shouted liar at george w. bush during a state of the union address. the party which claims to be race-blind has become blind to its own tacit bigotry.
as a result, health insurance coverage for abortion is now more limited than before the aca. a ruling in zubik v. burwell that eliminated contraceptive coverage for workers at employers like the little sisters would similarly leave women paying out of pocket for birth control, because there would be no alternative.
insurers will be allowed to sell skimpier plans. the affordable care act defines four metal levels of coverage ― bronze, silver, gold and platinum ― that offer increasingly more generous coverage that, in general, comes with increasingly higher premiums. each metal level must cover a certain percentage of a typical person's medical expenses. for instance, a silver plan has to cover at least 70 percent. obama allowed plans to vary within their metal level by 2 percentage points in either direction. trump will give them more leeway. a silver plan could cover between 66 percent and 72 percent of medical costs. this has a side effect of potentially lowering the value of the tax credit subsidies for premiums, because they're based in part on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each geographic area. if that benchmark silver plan covers only 66 percent of medical expenses, it will have a lower price, and that lower price will lead to smaller subsidies for all policies in that locale.
and corker, apparently getting a busy signal from trump's phone, was begging the incoming president to please send some clarifications. as politico reports, sen. rand paul (r-ky.) let it be known that he had spoken to trump earlier in the week and had secured his agreement to paul's demand that repeal and replace happen simultaneously. trump hadn't publicly confirmed this, leaving corker with no other choice than to ask trump if he would do so: if it his view, it would be really good if he would consider tweeting it out very clearly.
but when you challenge republicans on their claim, they simply point to the high-risk pools in their bill, which would have put sick people into a separate insurance program that, by all other accounts, would actually have raised their insurance prices.
we don't want to own it politically. president-elect donald trump, referring to obamacare
14 million is o ver three times the estimated 4.5 million people either injured or killed in car accidents in 2016. (will lack of health insurance become a leading cause of death?)
other cost-cutting efforts in the affordable care act remain in effect or have already extracted their savings. that includes another board with some of the same powers that ipab has ― and lower payments to private insurance companies that provide alternative coverage to medicare beneficiaries.
mcgrath's primary opponent, lexington mayor jim gray, called mcgrath to concede the race just two hours after polls closed, mcgrath campaign manager mark nickolas told huffpost. gray's campaign manager confirmed the concession call to the lexington herald-leader.
but the bill would also repeal the independent payment advisory board, or ipab, which is a commission of experts that the affordable care act created back in 2010.
the changes apply to people who got medicaid because of michigan's expansion of the program, in 2014, when the state tapped federal dollars available through the affordable care act and opened enrollment to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. under new requirements set to take effect in january 2020, those beneficiaries must demonstrate they are working at least 20 hours a week, trying to find work or unable to work.
in reality, countries with single government programs and other forms of national health insurance frequently have shorter waits for services ― not to mention far fewer people struggling with medical bills. just this past week, gallup published a survey in which one-third of americans reported that they or a family member postponed medical care because of concerns over cost.
retired neurosurgeon and bestselling author ben carson said in a statement wednesday he does not see a political path forward for his campaign after his poor showing on super tuesday.
but short-term plans are generally not available to people with pre-existing conditions and wouldn't cover the expenses of people with some serious illnesses anyway. if short-term plans were to draw off a substantial number of relatively healthy customers, they would drive up the price of traditional, fully regulated insurance plans even more.
now, republicans are undoing these reforms. the regulations that the trump administration just proposed would rescind the obama administration's limit on short-term plans, so that insurers could sell policies that last a full year. starting in 2019, people buying such plans wouldn't have to worry about paying the individual mandate penalty, since the gop's new tax legislation reduces that penalty to zero.
private insurance companies are failing the american people. we all know it, warren said. and whatever public alternatives you support, there is no reason on earth for us to continue allowing the health care of the american people to be held hostage by an industry that both attacks any new health care proposals and, at the same time, refuses to do any better.
short-term plans may not offer full financial protection, the latter say, but the policies are better than nothing ― and nothing is what many consumers have now.
suddenly canceling all of its reforms could cause chaos and leave literally tens of millions of americans newly unable to pay for their medical care.
but it's not a sure thing, thanks to trump. if he doesn't manage to kill off the affordable care act and its preexisting condition protections, it won't be for lack of trying.
when the discussion turned to policy details, biden paid particular attention to whether the final product would provide enough assistance to middle-class americans, according to jared bernstein and terrell mcsweeny, who were policy advisers on his white house staff. fighting for bigger subsidies inevitably meant fighting for a larger bill, which was something more conservative democrats in congress had resisted.
there have been consistent discussions about remote voting, but many lawmakers have resisted the idea, aware of how each party could abuse the process to duck questions during difficult votes (think about republicans during their 2017 efforts to repeal and replace obamacare).
but if the republican process has proved anything, it's that almost every republican will bend on his or her stated principles to check the box of repealing obamacare.

barrett testified she has not spoken to trump or his team about election cases, but skipped past democrats' pressing questions about ensuring the date of the election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power. she declined to commit to recusing herself from any post-election cases without first consulting the other justices.
house appropriations chairman rodney frelinghuysen (r-n.j.) noted on wednesday that his state has benefited from the expansion, and he said he would have to look carefully at the repeal bill and what it does to medicaid before committing his vote. obviously there has to be some sort of resolution, he said. but that didn't necessarily mean he would vote against something that repeals the expansion.
for the families who are living paycheck-to-paycheck, an increase in take-home-pay and a $1,000 bonus to start out the new year ― these are not crumbs, house speaker paul ryan said in an emailed statement last month.
if the public option is as attractive as proponents say it will be, it could eventually win over everyone or nearly everyone, creating something a lot like medicare for all. even if it serves only part of the population, it could help tens of millions.
the problem isn't obamacare per se. it lies in the structure of private markets for health insurance – which creates powerful incentives to avoid sick people and attract healthy ones. obamacare is just making this structural problem more obvious.
his views on the affordable care act are also likely to be a flashpoint during his confirmation hearing. in a 2011 dissenting opinion for the d.c. circuit court, for example, he declined to uphold the health care law but acknowledged that its individual mandate provision ― the fine people have to pay if they don't buy insurance coverage ― was within the purview of congress. republicans repealed the individual mandate in their tax cut law last year, however, raising questions as to how kavanaugh would rule on cases challenging obamacare.
she tried to fight that bill but couldn't get anywhere with either the exchange or her insurance carrier.
as of friday, biden's lead over trump in the popular vote was more than 4 million. by the time the counting is done, it could reach as high as 7 million. biden's final share of the popular vote is likely to end up around 52%, according to fivethirtyeight's nate silver.
a blue-red divide on health care
how dumb was this trumpcare boomlet? so dumb that we were treated to a cameo appearance by sen. mitt romney (r-utah).
many of the impediments to prep's uptake among black msm have also long plagued efforts to engage hiv-positive african americans in care for the virus. such parallels raise the question of whether the leadership behind prep's introduction failed to rely on basic intuition to anticipate prep's anemic rollout among black msm.
most recently, in wake of the #brexit vote, democratic polling firm public policy polling asked voters about the possibility of texas exiting the united states. twenty-three percent of respondents in a national survey were supportive. curiously though those most supportive (43%) were not tea party conservatives but respondents who self-identified as very liberal. placed in this context, the results may reflect the polarization of american politics where increasingly we dislike those we disagree with.
nonsense. liberals don't need to celebrate every woman who achieves power. certainly, feminists don't. none have taken to twitter, for example, to cheer on ivanka trump, who talks a lot about being a working mother while actively supporting policies that are not good for women.
that would be highly problematic, thune said.
but she still allowed that she has concerns. i'm worried on any negativity that could obviously be more targeted towards a rural or older state because that is where i live and the folks i live with, moore capito said.
for some people now struggling to pay for insurance, including those who are uninsured because they cannot afford coverage available through the affordable care act, these short-term plans will seem like a big relief ― a point administration officials stressed tuesday night.

but there's no way to be sure, and in the meantime, republican policies may already be having an effect on medicaid enrollment. just this week, the census bureau reported that the number of americans without health insurance has risen for the first time since the affordable care act became law ― mostly because the number of people with medicaid has declined.
in starker contrast to both democratic approaches, president donald trump and the republican party are fighting to completely eliminate the affordable care act and make huge cuts to medicaid and medicare, with no plans for how to replace the coverage millions would lose as a result.
congressional republicans have been preparing to pass legislation repealing obamacare for trump to sign shortly after he assumes the presidency. the president-elect isn't saying the gop shouldn't proceed ― but it will be difficult for republicans to continue to blame democrats for obamacare's shortcomings, like trump suggests, if they pass legislation that disrupts the health care law's consumer subsidies and rules for health insurance companies.
and michigan is one of six states that still has straight-ticket voting — meaning voters can choose an entire party's slate of candidates with a single mark on the ballot. democrats are cautiously confident; the demographics of the undecided voters swing in their favor, and fewer and fewer voters are interested in splitting their ballots these days.
the picture that emerges is of a trusted institution whose practices violate its stated public mission, with little accountability or redress for its patients.
but sanders is no stranger to skepticism. almost nobody in mainstream politics took medicare for all seriously before sanders made it the linchpin of his 2016 bid for the democratic presidential nomination. and although he has effectively lost the support of one additional senator ― former minnesota democrat al franken co-sponsored the 2017 bill but his replacement, tina smith, isn't on the 2019 version ― sanders now boasts the support of twice as many outside groups as in 2017, including the powerful labor unions, the american federation of teachers and the service employees international union.

this is a mean-spirited strategy to repeal obamacare without a replacement, senate minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.) told reporters immediately after the meeting with obama.
house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) hailed kennedy as a relentless fighter for working americans. while trump has consistently broken his promises to the middle class, congressman kennedy profoundly understands the challenges facing hard-working men and women across the country, she said in a statement announcing kennedy's selection.
one is that it deviates from the usual justice department tradition under which its lawyers defend even laws that the sitting president and his party oppose. it's part of the president's duties, under article ii of the constitution, that he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
but at other times, trump has scaled back those promises. in a post-election 60 minutes interview with lesley stahl, trump offered that he'd continue to assure that people with pre-existing medical conditions were covered by insurance and to maintain the extended period through which children may remain on their parents' health plans. still, as recently as jan. 3, trump spokesperson kellyanne conway was, on his behalf, making a difficult-to-keep promise. as cnbc's dan mangan reports:
scott olson via getty images kim reynolds, iowa's republican governor, says obamacare is unworkable. but it has worked much better in states where officials support it.
associated press if the 5th u.s. circuit court rules against the affordable care act, the case will probably end up before the supreme court, where chief justice john roberts has joined liberals to reject two previous challenges to the law.
they include bills to make virginia the first state in the south to give workplace protections to domestic service workers, transition the state to a 100% clean energy grid by 2045 and extend stronger protections for pregnant workers. she was also instrumental in the successful fight to ratify the equal rights amendment as the chief sponsor in the state senate. (carroll foy was the lead in the house.) earlier, she was one of the leaders creating a state-based health exchange under obamacare.
strategically, murkowski's position makes sense, considering the alaskans who actually get her elected. despite representing a red state, her base is not conservative republicans, but a cobbled-together mix of moderate republicans, democrats and independents. and she's kept them with her for the better part of 16 years (she was initially appointed to her senate seat in december 2002).
a medi-share member diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis generally would be on the hook for a half-year's worth of drugs, some of which cost $2,000 or $3,000 a month, because for any single condition medi-share covers only a six-month supply of prescriptions each year. (they would still have access to discounted prices, which medi-share offers to members.) the same would be true for a member with hemophilia, treated with drugs that could cost 10 times that or more. a member with a child who has autism and needs speech therapy would discover that medi-share, like other ministries, doesn't usually cover those services at all.
the campaign says the proposed funding is adequate to cover the plan's costs and is consistent with a promise harris made not to tax the middle class. but given the cost of health care, even the most generous proposals out there typically assume that middle-class people pay something toward the cost of care, just as they do today, through some combination of premiums, taxes and out-of-pocket costs.
those have been wins. i've spent a lot of time with governors of both parties who would agree with you. the question is, how do you take that consensus, how do you take that lesson and how do you turn it into larger-scale wins and what's applicable in the states, what's applicable in different states, what's applicable at the federal level? those are all battles to be fought. and i think this is an organization that can hopefully be useful to that.

it is through such requests that reporters often obtain information about agency decisions and shine light on questionable activities by government officials. a bipartisan group of senators blasted the proposed rule change in a march letter to bernhardt, writing that it appears to restrict public access to doi's records and delay the processing of foia requests in violation of the letter and spirit of foia.
bidencare's immediate effect on employer coverage
donnelly did a lot to insert himself into the 2016 carrier story, but president donald trump overshadowed him when he swooped in later that year with a deal that saved the factory. after trump moved on to other things, however, donnelly continued to make noise about other indiana factory workers losing their jobs to mexico.
one provision in the gop plan to replace obamacare is already causing angst for people between ages 50 and 65: raising the ceiling on their premiums, which in all likelihood means they will pay more for health insurance. that's why aarp and other senior advocacy groups are gearing up to fight what could be premium hikes of 25 percent or more for those still too young to qualify for medicare.
medical assistance with disability is the only way to access the waiver program, which allows them to continue living independently, and without they would end up institutionalized (ie: nursing home, group home, etc).

the most important issue of the past year and the one that reflects most directly on trump's job performance is his management of the covid-19 pandemic. at last count, more than 230,000 americans are dead, millions more have been sickened, and the country is in the middle of a third surge that epidemiologists predicted but that trump insisted wouldn't happen.

the bonuses are also a small amount of money compared to what firms are throwing at their shareholders. since trump signed the tax bill into law on dec. 22, companies have announced $88 billion worth of stock buybacks, according to an analysis by the stock market research firm birinyi associates. that's more than twice the amount of share repurchases firms announced during the same period last year.

it's not that the jct couldn't do the work, known as a macroeconomic analysis. but the house bill was moving so fast that the jct couldn't get an analysis out in time for the vote. (jct finished its report on the house bill 25 days after that chamber voted on it.) so, the jct focused on assessing the senate version, which came later. that report made it to senators dec. 1, 2017 — just one day before they voted on their bill. the report concluded that even with the economic growth the tax cuts would generate, the senate bill would still cost the nation more than $1 trillion over 10 years.
the final 2014 government spending agreement (known as the cromnibus) slashed the ipab's minuscule administrative funding. neither the white house, house or senate ever appointed the board's members, as they were supposed to do.
they had hoped to revisit and improve the law, but never had the chance. instead, they've ceded power to president donald trump and the republicans, who, unable to wipe obamacare off the books, have tried to undermine it instead. amid that environment, many of the program's problems have lingered ― and some have gotten worse.
this kind of predictive analytics is also evident in finance, with the new york stock exchange teaming up with social market analytics (sma) a few years ago to test whether sentiment analysis could predict share movement.

in kansas, kobach's defeat of colyer ― the election was held last week, but coyler finally conceded tuesday night ― can be almost directly attributed to trump. kobach, who shares trump's desire to investigate non-existent voter fraud and crack down on immigration, won by a mere 345 votes after trump endorsed him the day before the primary. he's set to face democratic state legislator laura kelly and independent businessman greg orman in november. private gop polling showed kobach significantly less popular than colyer among the general electorate.
in briefs urging the court to wait, trump administration lawyers said there was no rush because the mandate no longer subjects any individual to any concrete consequence.
these mandates came with a cost. including these benefits has forced insurance companies to pick up medical expenses they were able to avoid previously, and as a result they have raised premiums to cover their new costs ― a point that spicer, during his daily white house briefing, made correctly.
the plaintiffs in texas v. u.s. are the gop officials from alabama, arizona, arkansas, florida, georgia, indiana, kansas, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, nebraska, north dakota, south carolina, south dakota, texas, utah and west virginia.
washington ― president donald trump's partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new congress on wednesday with no end in sight.
louisville, ky. ― three years ago this week, jubilant kentucky republicans declared their democratic rivals were gone for good. on election night 2016, voters handed the gop its first legislative majority in nearly a century ― and gave republicans total control of the bluegrass state.
in nashville, tenn., last year, months after a law was enacted banning abortion after 20 weeks, a pregnant woman was said by police to have hit herself in the abdomen repeatedly and allowed a relative to sit on her abdominal area in an attempt to end a 24-week pregnancy .
it wasn't clear whether other justices were inclined to agree. but practically speaking, it won't matter as long as there are at least five votes to uphold the law regardless of the mandate's constitutionality. the affordable care act will then keep functioning like it does today.
a substantial number of senate republicans have made it clear they cannot vote for the house bill, which would reduce regulations on health insurance, rearrange tax credits for people buying health insurance and dramatically cut funding for medicaid ― leaving many millions of americans without health insurance while exposing older, sicker people to some combination of higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
that possibility helps explain why the state's biggest insurer, blue cross blue shield of kansas, is among the proposal's biggest critics. that has produced an unlikely alliance between the insurer and patient advocacy groups ― and, more recently, a fight on twitter in which the blue cross and farm bureau hurled accusations of bad faith and dishonesty at one another.
the bullet points published on the billionaire businessman's website wednesday night don't amount to a detailed plan to overhaul the health care system, but they're about as specific as is typical for a presidential campaign and in line with the vague proposals touted by rivals sen. ted cruz (r-texas) and sen. marco rubio (r-fla.). it's certainly more than the republican congress has managed to produce in the six years since the aca became law. and, yes, trump calls it healthcare reform to make america great again.
illinois, maryland and massachusetts also welcomed new republican governors last year who followed democrats, and scrapping medicaid expansion hasn't been up for discussion in those states. arizona gov. doug ducey (r) hasn't moved to undo the expansion implemented by his republican predecessor, jan brewer, either.
he also wants to resume the now-dormant bipartisan project of eliminating surprise medical billing for patients that unknowingly receive treatment from doctors who do not participate in a hospital's insurance agreements.
whatever happens on april 24, we have definitely laid the groundwork to continue the momentum forward, tipirneni said.
it concerned me seeing this, accusing me and all these other people of being jihadists, lyness said. while it's ridiculous, and everything she's saying is false and ludicrous, i do wonder who might be reading this and might follow up and want to contact or threaten anyone on this list.
and those obstacles loom larger every day. precisely because medicare for all is getting more serious attention, it's also generating more serious pushback ― not just from republicans and health care industry groups, who are already mobilizing against it, but also from some democrats, who say the sanders proposal would be too difficult to pull off, as policy or politics, or simply not a great idea on the merits.
i'm going to potentially lose my health insurance. i've had a pre-existing condition, i've had breast cancer. what is going to happen to me? she said with tears in her eyes.
if that's the worst a tea party republican ushered into office by a wide margin in a conservative state can do to obamacare, maybe supporters of the affordable care act don't have that much to worry about. and maybe those eager about repealing the law should steel themselves for more disappointment.
as peggy noonan and others have pointed out, jeb's campaign at times seems silly, as when he says his father is the greatest man alive. and he's tired of attacks on his mother and his brother. it's almost as if he's an adolescent trying to learn the ropes.
rural americans tend to be older, in poorer health and less insured than those living elsewhere, the latter resulting in a greater share of uncompensated care for rural hospitals. because of declining populations in rural areas, hospitals there often have empty beds, which means less revenue.
these activists, most of them new to politics, spoke of being inspired by the opportunity to make positive change in their communities. some spoke of being driven to act by the election of president donald trump. but they all lamented the feeling that their government doesn't care what they want.
dent told the huffington post on wednesday that he didn't know if there were 218 votes in the house for a repeal bill that gets rid of the medicaid expansion, and he said most republicans in his roughly 50-member moderate tuesday group, of which dent is the chairman, believe that an obamacare repeal would need to be coupled simultaneously with a replacement bill and that republicans would have to think carefully about what they do for medicaid.
the work requirements are the subject of an ongoing legal dispute, and it's possible federal judges will stop at least some of these efforts from going forward because, by law, states aren't supposed to change medicaid in ways that could harm people eligible for coverage. but whether state republicans are able to undermine either medicaid or private insurance market changes in more states will also depend on political pressure at the state level.
the consequences of the trump administration's argument are not academic or an abstraction, biden added. for many americans, they're a matter of life and death, in a literal sense. this argument will determine whether health care coverage of more than 20 million americans who acquired it under the affordable care act will be ripped away in the middle of the nation's worst pandemic in a century.
friday's approval of kentucky's new plan came one day after the trump administration announced it would approve work requirements. this represented a considerable policy shift. previously, the obama administration had rejected such requests, arguing that work requirements violate medicaid's guarantee of health care for poor people. these are the same arguments that advocates for the poor are likely to make if and when they sue to block the changes.
like those proposals, the draft legislation would generally reduce financial assistance for lower- and middle-income people buying private health insurance. it would also weaken standards for what those plans cover, roll back funding for the medicaid expansion and create a new tax on employer-provided health insurance.

although buttigieg's thinking on the public option and medicare for all is likely to attract the most attention from the most politically engaged observers, the feature of his plan likely to make the most immediate, widespread impact is its proposal to bolster the insurance now available through healthcare.gov and state marketplaces like covered california that the affordable care act created.
solicitor general noel francisco argued in a brief that because congress in 2017 invalidated the law's individual coverage mandate — by dropping a tax penalty for those without health insurance — the entire aca thus must fall.
instead, the biggest tradeoff in biden's plan is likely to be the sheer cost. his proposal would make insurance more affordable primarily by having the government spend a lot more to subsidize people who don't get enough help now.
while republicans have said all year that it's important to get wall funding in the next round of appropriations, democrats have made it clear they're unwilling to go along with that sort of spending bill. so, rather than potentially shut down the government over a wall, republicans are passing as many government funding bills as possible and leaving the wall for another day.
this again comes down to language and creativity. all this talk of punitive taxation and the 1% is pushing away those who might want to help. as just one creative alternative, we could offset some rates with an inventory of mutual interest investment opportunities (where the rich gain some discretion about where their marginal dollars go). we'd still realize the desired benefits, but we'd give top payers some agency and the ability to feel good about their contributions. there are tens of thousands of such projects out there, each of which might allow the invisible hand (as adam smith actually conceived it) to let self-benefiting investments serve a wider end. think of it like donors choose for civic development.
for hagwood, the fact that congress didn't consider race when determining who got the biggest tax cuts is confirmation that lawmakers don't have her or other minorities in mind when writing tax legislation.
to prove his point, bates cited a series of emails, financial documents and testimony about verbal conversations involving aetna officials over the past several months.
that post-roe world that we are all so worried about? for many women it is already here, said abigail aiken, an assistant professor of public affairs at the university of texas at austin, who conducted the study in ireland. already abortion is essentially out of reach for women who cannot afford to travel long distances and live in the most anti-abortion states, where clinics are far apart and medicaid does not pay for the procedure.
it is only the latest example of trump trying to accomplish through regulation what republicans have been unable, so far, to achieve through legislation.
rather than wait for that process to play out, the democratic lawyers asked the supreme court to take the case directly and do so as quickly as possible. on monday, the court said yes to taking the case but no to taking it right away.
the disproportionate impact on seniors in long-term care facilities is stark, accounting for 8% of all covid-19 cases but 40% of deaths. the number of cases in nursing homes has remained high in good part because, even after six months, many facilities still lack the supplies, staff and testing needed to control the virus's spread. the situation puts senior citizens at risk ― and their caregivers, too.
the buy is focused on two ads: the first, last chance, features a young woman talking about the need to prevent republicans from repealing obamacare.
in 2016, kenneth thorpe, an emory university economist who had served in the clinton administration, concluded that tax hikes necessary to finance the sanders proposal would leave nearly three-quarters of working households that previously had private coverage owing more in taxes than they would have owed in premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
what repealing the aca would mean for opioid treatment
harris responded: i did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.
the annual open enrollment period for the health insurance exchange marketplaces the affordable care act created aren't until fall, but the law allows people to sign up and apply for subsidies whenever they experience a qualifying life event. losing your job-based health benefits is one of those events.
last year, the administration said it would allow states to add work requirements to medicaid, contrary to the program's statutory purpose of providing health benefits to people with low incomes. it cut spending on obamacare outreach and pushed to allow employers with moral″ objections to drop birth control from their health plans. and in december, the administration took a proposed food benefit cut ― one that house republicans had drafted but the senate rejected ― and stuck it into a regulation. no congress needed!
it's just that the moderates have so far taken a softer line on what they need to support an obamacare repeal.
when huffpost asked in a follow-up exchange what had caused gross' change of heart, a campaign spokesperson reiterated gross' public option proposal and his critique of sullivan's vote to repeal the aca. the campaign did not provide additional information about gross' evolution.
in other words, it should be basic for any human being to know that that love is better than hate, peace is better than violence, knowledge is better than ignorance, courage and compassion are better than fear, and a healthy respect for difference is always better than just tolerating people.
it's important for us to look at [this] as african americans; it's important to voice my opinions on issues that directly affect me and my brothers and sisters, because they may not have the same insight as i do, she told huffpost. and it's that more important for me to break it down to my brothers and sisters to say, 'hey, this is how they're running game on you. you need to understand. you need to get out and vote.' everybody's so quick to be revolutionary after something happens, i want to be proactive in it.
but there's scant evidence that kentucky's changes will have the effects that bevin and his allies are promising. in fact, of the roughly 95,000 people expected to lose coverage, some will almost surely be people who are working ― or have reasons why they can't work ― but who failed to satisfy the new system's paperwork requirements.
chances are fairly high that trump will have his bluff called, as the conservative bloc of house members continued to insist the bill fell short of the promised full repeal of the affordable care act. rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), who chairs the house freedom caucus, left the meeting with speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and administration officials saying that negotiations continue precisely because his group was not yet on board with the final product.

the best 501(c)(3)s [the irs designation for nonprofits] have highly diverse sources of funding. they're not dependent on anybody. nobody gets a chance to sway policy. and, you know, you've got to give the organization time to demonstrate that, but we're taking lessons from the best of them. we felt it's important not to take money from insurance companies, not to take money from for-profits, from pacs. those are important.
but some of his biggest contributors are heavy hitters from the finance world, including the investors stewart alsop and amos hostetter and private equity titan carl ferenbach.
but often the feud is less about policies or ideas and more about decorum ― the unspoken rules of etiquette that dominate life in the nation's capital. twice now at high-profile hearings, some of the most liberal members of the house leadership have sided with republicans to rebuke other staunch liberals for violations of this code of conduct.
the chicago-based company that operates a lucrative network of blue cross blue shield health insurance plans made out like gangbusters with president donald trump's tax law. even though it paid no taxes last year, it collected a massive $1.7 billion tax refund, according to the company's latest financial report.
i cannot recall if there was a buzz about illinois sen. barack obama giving the keynote speech for the convention. what i do recall is that i was struck by how baby-faced he was, how polished obama was as a speaker—what folks call charisma—and by the fact that he was very clear about his message: that there is only one america and that the divides were senseless.
california gov. gavin newsom said friday that imperial county, which has one of the highest rates of positive coronavirus cases in the state, should reinstate its social distancing orders.
the braun campaign, in a statement, insisted donnelly was the real outsourcer in the race.
even if the law were changed to make it possible to buy birth control only coverage, insurers would have little incentive to offer it. insurance works when lots of people buy it and only some people use it. a customer in the market for an insurance policy that covers only one thing -- like contraception -- presumably intends to use that benefit, which undermines the entire point of insurance.
2. senate republicans voted 48-51 on a budget which will help them repeal obamacare. there is no alternative plan so... this is great. more here.
and sen. doug jones of alabama, likely the most vulnerable democratic incumbent in the country, has introduced legislation that would have the federal government fully reimburse states for the cost of the expansion for three years. jones and sen. mark warner (d-va.) tried to pass the legislation via unanimous consent in the senate last week but were denied.
some combination of higher turnout among democratic partisans and more of these independents voting democratic is the reason that president-elect joe biden narrowly carried michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin ― three parts of the fabled blue wall that trump had won narrowly in 2016, giving him the win.
to commemorate the 10th anniversary of president barack obama signing the affordable care act into law, huffpost returned to the subjects of previous stories to find out what's happened since.
anti-abortion leaders have consistently said that they do not seek to punish women who have abortions. in fact, when donald trump suggested, in a town hall moderated by msnbc's chris matthews during the 2016 campaign, that there has to be some form of punishment for the woman involved, the national right to life organization publicly declared its long-standing view that unborn children and their mothers are victims in an abortion.
the point is a key one. if the cbo is correct, and obamacare is actually stable, the gop's only option to kill the law would be to try to undermine it.
still, democrats contacted by the huffington post said they nevertheless would be willing to work across the aisle to fix the problems that do exist in the individual insurance markets created under president barack obama's signature law.
the finance committee kicked off a series of five get-togethers specifically on the bill's provisions. in one marathon session, held april 21, 1986, titled proposals related to excise taxes, 27 witnesses —limited to five minutes each—testified in one day. a house ways and means subcommittee, not satisfied even though that chamber had already passed its bill, held a hearing on miscellaneous tax provisions. ninety-two witnesses were called.
that trump failed to grow and learn in office is a disappointment for republicans, but probably should have been expected. in fact, trump described his approach to work three decades earlier, in his art of the deal bestseller that led to the tv shows. i leave my door open. you can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure, he wrote. i prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.

at howard, obama summarized the narrative of our history--as well as how it relates to the course of our future. he described:
turns out, the image is from a 2009 calendar of conservative ladies, all draped in fur, according to abc news. the blurb alongside conway's photo highlighted her career as a pollster.
and scaling back the medicaid cuts or bolstering tax credits for older consumers ― a priority for many gop senators ― costs money. and the republicans don't have a lot of money at their disposal.
there is nothing we can do, swanson said.
we must choose whether we are defined by our differences ― or whether we dare to transcend them.
but the differences are more striking than the similarities. they reveal a lot about which party is more serious about policymaking ― and which one actually cares about helping people get health care.
the reality is when you look at all the trends before he became president, we were in the middle of the longest period of continuous job growth, said bill spriggs, chief economist at the afl-cio. he continued to benefit from the tailwind.
about a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight dec. 21 after trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the senate on a unanimous vote. trump changed his mind after fox news and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.
trump has given no indication he has similarly strong feelings about the house bill ― or that he even understands it at more than a superficial level. he has said he wants the win, which is what he always wants. but the president repeatedly has made it clear that he's not picky about what the win actually achieves, only that he wants it to somehow mean the end of obamacare.
subsidized plans purchased under obamacare would not qualify as acceptable health insurance under the new rule, according to the wall street journal, which was the first to report on the new rule.
perhaps the same sequence of events would have transpired if it were some other georgetown law student who had gone to the hill that day. but fluke handled the limbaugh incident with a unique bit of mettle. she told the podcast she felt very strongly that we could not allow it to in any way appear that this had been successful in silencing me or silencing other people who were speaking out on this issue.
the parliamentary math for gop leaders is difficult. even under reconciliation rules, which allow republicans to pass legislation with just 50 votes assuming vice president mike pence breaks the tie, leadership can afford to lose only two members. and there are plenty more than two members who seem convinced the senate is far from agreeing on anything.
mcsally insisted that sinema's criticisms were unfair.
a lot of the right-wing, extreme, very hateful policy agenda of the current administration was done through the executive office, rep. rashida tlaib (d-mich.) said.
the spending agreement, which congress must still approve and president donald trump must still sign, actually affects health care in several ways. it would put new money into opioid treatment, renew funding for community clinics that serve the poor and extend funding for the children's health insurance program, which congress reauthorized last month, by another four years.
the specter of such a dramatic change was one reason the clinton proposal became so politically toxic and ultimately failed to get through congress.
florida's 25th is among the districts nationwide that democrats are targeting in the democratic congressional campaign committee's red to blue program. hillary clinton lost the district by only 1.5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.
the american health care act would cut taxes by $592 billion over a decade. the medicaid cuts alone total $880 billion and the gop's $361 billion health insurance tax credits would cost 46 percent of the what the affordable care act's more generous tax credits would over the same period.
both paul and shevin, 64, have beaten the odds before and survived cancer. though paul is hoping the same happens at the supreme court, she has no illusions about what would happen to her if the aca goes away. i still cannot believe that they will take insurance away from 20-some million people. i just can't believe it, she said.
if the bill ends up gutting insurance regulations more, as conservative members have urged house leadership to do, it would mean still lower premiums but still higher out-of-pocket costs, along with gaps in coverage for services like mental health and maternity care.

what's more, the changes the administration is making could actually reduce overall enrollment and discourage healthier, and thus less costly, consumers from signing up.
but these are band aids. the real choice in the future is either a hugely expensive for-profit oligopoly with the market power to charge high prices even to healthy people and stop insuring sick people.
this would ignite a familiar debate over whether such control would stifle innovation or create shortages. it would also draw familiar attacks from the health care industry, which is already preparing to pounce.
you're the man that talks about the death panel, peterson said at the packed town hall in iowa falls. we're gonna create one great big death panel in this country [if] people can't afford to get insurance. don't repeal obamacare, improve it.
if your solutions are progressive solutions, i think that's ok, baldwin told huffpost in an interview.
sometimes, though, trump's habit of typing out an idea without thinking it through has generated real consequences.
ruth bader ginsburg isn't a feminist legend because she was a working mother any more than brett kavanaugh is a feminist legend for being a working father. rbg is a feminist hero because, as a litigator, she took on hundreds of cases fighting for gender equality and is literally responsible for getting the supreme court to put women's rights into the constitution. as a justice on the high court, she continued that project.
they also want the justices to take the case right away in order to settle the issue before the november elections.
sessions' justice department doesn't go quite as far as these state officials, seeking only to have the court invalidate the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. other parts of the affordable care act, including its subsidies for private insurance and its expansion of medicaid for poor adults, would remain if the court rules the way justice wants.
danielle and tracy have four children, including a pair of twins, and a fifth now on the way. they live in a single-story ranch-style house near the center of norfolk, just a few blocks down the street from a bank and a pizza hut ― and about two miles from the childhood home of johnny carson, the city's most famous former resident.
these plans would require some combination of tax increases and new regulations, with effects that would vary depending on the specifics of the plan ― and, ultimately, the specific financial circumstances of each individual.
president barack obama promised that health care reform would not increase the deficit and, for better or worse, congress wrote a bill consistent with that pledge. when the congressional budget office (cbo) evaluated the final legislation, it found that, on net, it would mean the government taking in more money than it would spend ― in other words, the deficit would come down.

biden survived, but he did so by going down in the mud with the rest of the field ― something he vowed not to do upon entering the race. here are some key takeaways from the debate.
fourteen hours earlier in new york city, alexandria ocasio-cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist, unseated rep. joe crowley, a powerful democrat believed to have designs on the house speakership. her victory demonstrated the virtues of a left-wing platform grounded in frankly stated values rather than in moulton's pragmatism for pragmatism's sake.
we may be, for example, working in a state that has a republican legislature or a democratic governor, or vice versa. we may be working in a whole variety of settings, and we want to demonstrate to people that we are focused on their interests and then turn them into good policy ideas.
maddow called out hillary clinton on her campaign's recent attacks.
burnett reminded murtaugh that at least joe biden has a plan out there. president trump has promised one for three years. if there was a plan, we would have seen it by now. pretty obvious, right?
he made similar vows repeatedly, noting that it was an un-republican thing to say. but once in office, he outsourced policymaking to republican leaders in congress and did everything he could to help pass repeal proposals, which envisioned many millions losing coverage. the popular backlash was a major reason house republicans lost their majority in the 2018 midterms.
beshear and the state party knocked on more than 1 million doors during the campaign, and ran a get-out-the-vote operation that helped turn out voters in deep blue areas of the state, like lexington and louisville, and in rural counties. the teachers, meanwhile, staged election events in nearly all of the state's 120 counties, patterson said, and ran their own canvassing efforts.
as new covid-19 cases were breaking records and the american death toll was ticking toward 125,000, trump boasted in a tweet thursday night about how well the u.s. was doing.
he's still at it, and it's still complete hogwash.
[the teachers] have been able to whip up a decent amount of anti-bevin fervor in places that are generally republican, voss said. and they've also been able to keep the focus of the governor's race on economic and lunch-pail issues, more so than usual.
i don't believe he made any commitment whatsoever and i think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment, harris said.
whether or not they make sense in principle, we know what happens with work requirements, gordon told huffpost. people don't get information on how to comply, they don't understand how they are supposed to comply, they try to comply and are not able to, or they comply and government makes a mistake and doesn't realize it.
you can see the exchange below starting at the 4:44 mark.
he keeps saying he'll release a new health care plan, but misses his own deadlines. meanwhile, his administration is actively trying to invalidate obamacare and its protections for preexisting conditions in court. the case will get a hearing at the supreme court just days after the election, ensuring voters won't hear the oral arguments until after they've cast their ballot.
pratt is a volunteer for reclaim idaho, a tiny grassroots operation with a single paid employee and a mission to give idahoans an opportunity to vote on a ballot initiative in november's elections to expand medicaid to working adults.
like so many other parts of the aca, the risk adjustment program affects only insurers that sell to individuals and small employers. it calls for a series of payments to flow back and forth between insurers and government. the idea is to address the fact that, by accident or on purpose, some carriers end up with healthier enrollees while others end up with sicker ones.

defending this majority won't be easy. in 2022, both warnock and kelly will have to run for reelection after just two years in office. hassan will be defending her swing-state seat, as will nevada sen. catherine cortez masto. democrats could offset any of these losses with victories in gop-held seats in wisconsin, pennsylvania or north carolina, but things will only get dicier in 2024.
the address took place one week after house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) invited trump to speak. pelosi delayed trump's address amid a partial government shutdown, during which 800,000 federal workers went without pay for 35 days as trump demanded funding for a wall at the u.s.-mexico border.
it's a complicated dance — slam gop policies without attacking trump, promote bipartisanship while bashing mcconnell. and with five democratic senators running for re-election in 2018 in states trump won by double digits, donnelly won't be the only one who needs to learn the steps. while the democratic base is fired up to deliver a blow to the president in the midterms, donnelly and other red-state democrats want to keep the focus on the gop's unpopular tax and health care policies while showing they can work with the president at times. it's an approach democrats are confident can work in indiana.
but even with some of the pressure off, they appear to have made only a little headway ― enough to identify the key issues dividing them but not to make much progress on resolving those differences.

secretary acosta. so he has turned out to be one of our greats. i told you about health care. he came out of nowhere with this incredible plan, trump said in iowa.
for those who see these latest comments from trump and wonder if they might be going insane, you have company: house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) reportedly agrees that it's crazy trump is talking about health care again. at least one republican leader knows when it's time to stop talking rubbish.
house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) did not seem impressed, or at least not impressed enough to give up republican insistence on attaching unrelated provisions to the funding.
in states that waived requirements for substance use disorder and mental health benefits, coverage for drug dependence treatment would cost an extra $20,450, and coverage for depression would cost an extra $8,490.

fox news host tucker carlson told ryan it's kind of a hard sell to argue the wealthy should get a tax cut under the american health care act. ryan brushed it off.
conservatives have teetered between strongly opposing the gop health care bill and looming support. the house freedom caucus has negotiated with the white house on potentially eliminating essential health benefits and some unknown provisions in title i of the affordable care act. that expansive section of the 2010 health care law republicans are trying to repeal includes provisions requiring coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to remain on a parent's plan until they're 26 years old.
trump was speaking at a press conference to announce $2 billion in new grants to state and local agencies. the money, which came from a bipartisan bill that congress passed and trump signed last year, is meant to make the kind of treatment they offer at western wayne even more widely available than it is now. it will almost certainly help a lot of people, and it's a credit to its sponsors ― most of whom, regardless of party, presumably feel genuine compassion for their constituents battling substance abuse.
we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
there shouldn't be any such illusions this time around, especially in an election that seems primarily a referendum on bevin. the governor's self-inflicted damage may have handed democrats a one-time opportunity, said western kentucky university political scientist scott lasley. i would think that 2020, when the entire kentucky statehouse and half of the state senate will be up for reelection, is a return back to normal.
you're going to get it now, said another.
that could have dragged out the case for years, since o'connor would have needed time to issue a new ruling, and then his ruling would have prompted yet another appeal to the circuit court, and then that circuit court's new ruling would just as inevitably have prompted an appeal to the supreme court.
a critical problem facing prep promotion among african americans is their overall disenfranchisement from the health care system. frequently a by-product of poverty and unemployment, this alienation from what many progressives argue is a basic american right is often compounded by an accident of geography. those with very low incomes who live in the 19 states with governments that have refused to expand medicaid under the affordable care act (aca, or obamacare)—including almost all the states in the republican-dominated south—have been summarily excluded from the recent mass expansion of the health care rolls.
republicans usually get the blame for shutdowns because they usually cause the shutdowns, which is inevitable as they have become more controlled by their ideologically extreme members, said anna greenberg, a democratic pollster with greenberg quinlan rosner.
on wednesday, the issue had been the aca's expansion of medicaid ― in particular, the trump administration's support of work requirements for people who get insurance through the program. in a pair of rulings, the judge declared that such requirements in arkansas and kentucky were arbitrary and capricious because officials had not demonstrated they further medicaid's basic mission, the provision of medical coverage to the needy.
booker also won applause with other lines he deployed against biden, particularly in their skirmish over the former vice president's criminal justice record.

she supports creating a medicare-like public option to compete with private plans that would be accessible to all americans.
health care has emerged as a top issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, with progressives, in particular, excited about the possibility of creating a government-run, medicare for all insurance program that would cover everybody. one of the 2020 front-runners, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), is the idea's most famous champion. another front-runner, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), has endorsed it.
damon dahlen/huffpost joe biden speaks at the afscme forum in las vegas on saturday. this has been an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits, he says.
led by texas attorney general ken paxton, republican officials from 20 states brought this lawsuit in february 2018. the trump administration allied itself with them four months later, refusing to defend the affordable care act in court — a highly unusual move, as the administration in power typically defends federal laws in court even when the president does not support them.
ah yes the constitution understander has logged on https://t.co/oksly3oqpu — david mack (@davidmackau) february 15, 2019
iowa is a state where the differential is particularly striking. a 55-year-old single man in des moines with an annual income of $35,000 can get coverage through healthcare.gov and pay less than $700 in annual premiums for it, thanks to the tax credits. a 55-year-old with an income of $55,000 has to pay full price, which works out to more than $11,000 a year.
democratic officials for california and 19 other states have since stepped in to defend the law and, after the 2018 midterm elections, democrats controlling the house authorized their counsel to do the same. their lawyers were in the new orleans courtroom on tuesday, as were the lawyers for the gop state officials and trump administration.
and even though the kynect brand name and website are being made sacrifices at the altar of anti-obamacarism, kentucky will continue to have a health insurance exchange that oversees insurers and handles other functions, following a model already adopted by hawaii, new mexico, nevada and oregon.
but thompson, born and raised in south carolina's capital, said there's one thing each candidate can improve on: canvassing in the community.
house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) also pledged to never forget in his part of a 10-minute remembrance ceremony on the steps of the capitol on friday.
everybody knows what happened to the conventional wisdom once 2007 turned to 2008. certainly clinton does. this time around, even as she amassed advantages that may still prove insurmountable, her campaign put forth a strong message: we get it. we've changed.
the money goes everywhere, but it often doesn't go towards what the patients really want or need or care about. on the whole, we see from our health outcomes that higher costs doesn't lead to better care.
republicans are trying to jam through a supreme court nominee who was selected specifically because he would overturn roe v. wade and end protections for people with pre-existing conditions, sen. patty murray (d-wash.) told reporters on wednesday.
it's just unconscionable that on the backs of seniors they would pay for this huge corporate tax cut that puts billions of dollars into the pockets of companies like exxon and walmart, as opposed to folks who could really use that help, she added.
health care has proven to be an early flashpoint in the democratic presidential primary, as progressives champion a single-payer, medicare for all program and centrists favor reforms to the affordable care act.
to have hope, victory doesn't have to be certain. it doesn't even have to be probable. to have hope, victory just has to be possible. luke mayville, reclaim idaho
the last part is especially important for the disabled and elderly, who are likely to be wary of any changes to traditional medicare. this makes medicare stronger, she said, recalling the difficulty she faced when she was taking care of her ailing mother, who eventually died at age 103. i was always concerned whether she was getting the right care ― and i have the resources, i'm a member of congress. think what it's like for everybody else.
inslee's plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the affordable care act all along. he's calling for the state to create a public option ― a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state's exchange, washington healthplanfinder.
these steps could help split insurance markets into two ― one with relatively cheap, skimpy short-term plans that would be available to people who are in good health, and one with highly expensive comprehensive insurance that would be available to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions.
handler's problems with the health care law started early, when she found in 2013 that the plan she'd been buying for years directly from an insurance company wouldn't be renewed the following year because it didn't meet affordable care act standards.
in tuesday's debate, sanders and warren stuck to their unwritten non-aggression pact and easily dispatched their moderate rivals on stage, who played poor stand-ins for the former vice president. they'll likely do the same against the front-runner at the next debate in houston, presenting biden with his biggest test yet.
chaffetz had, after all, run for speaker in october 2015, before ryan got into the race, back when it was just rep. daniel webster (r-fla.) and heavy front-runner majority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.).
those late signups don't merely boost the program's enrollment numbers. they also help insurers to hold down premiums.
the republican legislation has attracted opposition from major health care groups, including the american medical association, american nurses association, aarp and the american hospital association.
one of her favorite things to do was to [represent] men who wanted more caregiving responsibilities, said mar. that's an ongoing project, she added, pointing to a recent case the aclu filed against jp morgan for giving men less parental leave than women.
in announcing his plans to shore up obamacare monday, biden equated republican efforts to repeal the law with plans from other democratic presidential contenders that would completely overhaul the u.s. health care system and eliminate private health insurance.
you can watch hatch's comments below:
sanders, whose 2016 presidential bid vaulted single-payer into the political mainstream, held a live digital town hall about medicare for all on tuesday that drew more than 1 million viewers in real time.
it's not just that the law's requirements have made insurance more expensive, reynolds and her fellow republicans say; it's that the high prices have driven healthy people out of the market, saddling insurers with big losses. the carriers have responded by raising premiums even higher or simply fleeing, which is why this year just one carrier, minnesota-based medica, offers policies through healthcare.gov.
that set up a natural experiment, comparing those who got the letters from those who didn't. those who received letters signed up for coverage in higher numbers and, among middle-aged adults, they were less likely to die in the two years that followed. for every 1,648 people who got the letters, one extra person lived.
i think a lot of people have moved to the left and are more socially progressive than congressman lynch, said elizabeth clifford, 78, a goldstein supporter who lives in a senior living community in hingham. i respect his perspective and his upbringing and i'm glad for him, for what he has achieved, but i think society needs to move beyond where we are now.
white house press secretary sean spicer on thursday defended the idea of taking away guaranteed maternity coverage in health insurance, denying that it would mean women must pay relatively more for their health care.
lawrence bryant / reuters many democrats want campaigns in the future to strike a balance between turning out the party's base and reaching out to the middle, as stacey abrams' campaign did.
the $322 million merely indicates the amount they would have charged arbitrarily before negotiated insurer discounts, said ge bai, an accounting and health policy associate professor at the johns hopkins carey business school.
litman noted that the protocols for how justices make these decisions aren't clear, which means the four more liberal justices might have to vote on whether to hear the case without first knowing, for sure, whether one of the more conservative justices will provide the crucial fifth vote for holding the hearing this session.
but whatever the proposal's label, it's plainly a more ambitious ― and more progressive ― health plan than the democratic party's most influential thinkers have embraced in the past. and that's what makes it noteworthy.
khanna acknowledged the frustration that members were feeling. but he didn't think it was fair to criticize leadership for not conveying what's going to be in this next bill ― it's still a matter of negotiating with mcconnell and mnuchin.
the change is scheduled to take effect in 30 days. visa applicants will have to prove they will be covered by approved health insurance or can demonstrate that they have the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs, according to the proclamation.
but while nixon faced plummeting poll numbers and wound up resigning before the impeachment charges could hit the house floor, trump is likely to get through a senate trial with at most a few republicans voting to remove him from office.
amid this torrent of criticism, support for the measure and the president championing is falling. polls now generally indicate that voters want republicans to slow down ― and that the aca, seven years into its existence, is finally becoming popular.
connecticut's evenly split state senate went blue, and democrats maintained control of the state house and the governor's mansion. democrats in colorado clinched unified control by flipping the state senate. in maine, democrats flipped both the state senate and the governor's seat. the democratic gubernatorial candidate won in new mexico — alongside two already-blue chambers — giving democrats complete control of the state's politics. and in new york, democrats flipped seats in the senate for consolidated control of the state.
a loud, bipartisan chorus of legal experts has said this argument is absurd. congress may have once thought the penalty was an essential part of the law, these experts note, but by 2017 congress had obviously changed its mind, as it has the right to do.
this could be a pivotal moment, says callen-lorde's mejia, to transform health care to work with and for black communities and be able to limit the historical marginalization that has existed in this community in relationship to health care.
(where a policy with similarities to the later obamacare was initiated in 2006 by then-governor republican mitt romney). 14 million is 1 0 times the population of maine (whose senator susan collins has expressed misgivings about the gop bill).
when pelosi dismissively called the green new deal the green dream or whatever they call it — nobody knows what it is, pelosi added — ocasio-cortez once again avoided criticizing pelosi.
democratic senators are trying to dig deeper into the judge's approach as a legal originalist, one who adheres to a more strict reading of the constitution, but the appellate court justice has declined to directly respond to many questions on abortion, health care and a potentially disputed presidential election, saying it's against judicial code to weigh in at this point.
and when beshear, whom statewide democrats have hailed for running one of the most organized campaigns in kentucky history, needed an army of volunteers to help turn out the vote, the teachers were there. nearly 1,000 educators volunteered for beshear's campaign, patterson said.
and if the farm bureau and wellmark want to impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, they can do that, too. people who receive organ transplants or have rare genetic disorders, such as hemophilia, frequently run up bills that exceed those limits.
i've never seen so much engagement from people who'd never done it before. nema brewer, public school employee and teacher organizer
and if the american health care act were to become law, coverage could end up even worse than it was before obamacare, because republicans have said they would keep in place the law's popular guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
between 2019 and 2025, many americans earning less than $30,000 will see their taxes increase until their effective rates are actually higher, as much as 0.7 percentage points more than if the new tax law had not passed, according to the jct. the wealthy will continue to pay at lower rates, as much as 1.5 percentage points lower.
we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. as we begin a new congress, i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans.
in fact, by almost every measure, america is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even eight years ago.
trump avoided military service as a young man during the vietnam war era. when he was draft-eligible, he received deferments because a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs in his feet.
i think that we will reach a tipping point in the next few years, scott says. but the faster we can reach this, the better. the racial and ethnic disparities in hiv infections among black msm necessitate a rapid approach.
we can continue the progress we've made by building each other up, not tearing each other down, abrams says in the ad.
the plan has two parts. the first is an expansion and enhanced enrollment outreach for metroplus, a city-run insurance program. the second is the creation of what de blasio called nyc care, which would give uninsured residents ― especially undocumented immigrants ― access to medical and mental health care services provided by hospitals and clinics managed by a city agency.
carlos barria / reuters trump celebrates the house's vote to repeal the affordable care act with then-house speaker paul ryan (wis.), left. the president has never delivered on his promises of universal coverage.
the trump administration lawyers trying to get rid of the affordable care act may have undermined a central argument of their case, thanks to an admission in their very own court papers.
uva said it doesn't foreclose on primary residences. but often a uva lawsuit leads to home loss because patients' credit is downgraded and they cannot keep up with hospital payment plans and mortgages.
i honestly never thought i would ever witness something like this, where white men in power would be challenged in this way.
in principle, softening that blow should have been easy. all it would have taken was a little extra financial assistance, with a little more government spending, in order to provide more of a cushion for the higher prices. but republicans refused to endorse that idea or any others that could shore up the system.
sen. mazie hirono (d-hawaii) asked kavanaugh the same two questions she's been asking all of president donald trump's nominees for the last seven months:
medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, indian health service reforms, the medicaid expansion ... all would fall by the wayside. timothy jost, law professor emeritus, washington and lee university
despite claims by trump and house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) that the affordable care act is unfixable, the trump administration has tools at its disposal it could use to make the affordable care act's health insurance exchanges more attractive to health insurers and potentially less costly for consumers. or trump could go in the other direction and undermine the law to bolster their case for replacing it later.
how did we get into this mess? former harvard physician and veteran new york times reporter elisabeth rosenthal breaks down the evolution of american medicine ― from an industry in the business of providing care to one that's geared entirely toward maximizing profits. with her new book an american sickness: how healthcare became big business and how you can take it back, rosenthal's goal was to start a very loud conversation about an institution in crisis.
those are a lot of changes, and figuring out how they all go together isn't simple. fortunately, four researchers on health policy have done that work. in a series of articles they published at vox, the experts (harvard's david cutler, covered california's john bertko, along with topher sprio and emily gee from the center for american progress) found that the net effect of the republican repeal bill would be to raise costs for the average insurance enrollee by $1,542 per year in 2017, and by $2,409 in 2020.
powell, arguably the most controversial speaker of the night given that some democrats view him as a war criminal, appealed to military families.
a majority of americans tell pollsters that they support medicare for all as a vague concept. but when they are informed that such a plan would mean eliminating private health insurance, support typically drops below 50%. nearly two-thirds of swing voters in the battleground state of michigan called a medicare for all plan that eliminates private health insurance a bad idea, according to an october poll conducted by the nonpartisan henry j. kaiser family foundation.
they may read [the warning], but that's not the same as understanding it, michael conway, colorado's interim commissioner, warned, noting that many people will assume these plans are still subject to the affordable care act's rules. because of the aca, now people think the baseline has changed ― that certain things are always covered.
this month, the trump administration proposed a regulation that would let states select plans from other states as benchmarks or pick and choose elements of plans in another state ― say, prescription coverage ― and make those part of their own benchmark.
her organization also had a training in early february that they expected about 100 people to attend. but they ended up having nearly 500 people and had to change venues three times just to keep up with the demand. they also streamed it on facebook live because there was so much extra interest.
i am confident that leadership recognizes there has to be some acknowledgment of the states that expanded medicaid, said rep. leonard lance (r-n.j.), one of the most likely candidates to vote against the gop's repeal plan.
but for the sake of argument, let's say that berners are meaner to hillary supporters. this might have something to do with my answer to question #2, that bernie fans see hillary as a part of the problem of the corrupting influence of big money on our political system, while hillary supporters don't see bernie as part of the problem of a potential trump presidency. since hillary and her husband are two of the biggest money raisers in politics while claiming to uphold progressive values, they're seen as both increasing and legitimizing the role of big donors in our political system. so for berners, hillary supporters are like people at a casino who root for the house to win. there are also berners who simply dislike hillary for a mix of other legitimate, illegitimate, and personal reasons -- and if the enemy of your enemy is your friend, the supporter of your enemy is going to catch some heat.
house republicans have successfully voted to repeal parts of obamacare ― or the entire thing ― more than 60 times in the last six years. but now that lawmakers could actually be making law, there's sudden apprehension in parts of the gop conference.
can i be disrespectful on behalf of all the people you're gonna kill? responded one constituent who was angry over the health care vote.
the u.s. appeared to be flattening its curve, but surges in infections across some parts of the country in recent weeks have led to record numbers of hospitalizations. vice president mike pence said earlier this week that the death toll in the u.s. could top 240,000.
for the past two years, murkowski has bucked her party when it often mattered the most. her vote against obamacare repeal was arguably her boldest; she resisted intense gop lobbying and public criticism from trump to join two other republicans, sens. susan collins of maine and the late john mccain of arizona, to torpedo her party's priority issue.
non-continuous coverage penalty: the bill also includes a requirement that insurers charge a 30% penalty on any individual who had a lapse in coverage of over two months at any point in the 12 months prior to starting a new insurance policy. some may describe this provision as akin to the individual mandate, though, to be clear, it does not require an individual to purchase insurance. rather, it penalizes anyone who chose not to do so, but later decides to purchase, and allows insures to keep the funds from such penalties.
i have worked in a bipartisan manner, not just in times of crisis but always, because i believe it best serves my constituents, my state and our country, frelinghuysen said in a long statement that called on others to take up public service. my father reminded me often that we are temporary stewards of the public trust. i have sincerely endeavored to earn that trust every day and i thank my constituents and my home state of new jersey for the honor to serve and i will continue to do so to the best of my abilities through the end of my term.

after the speech, he understands why trump's charisma had captivated so many. and though king may still be trying to understand the intricacies of elections now, he does see one thing very clearly: whoever gets the democratic nomination needs to be popular enough to beat trump.
i am troubled and disturbed by your refusal to say that you will take yourself out of that kind of case, sen. richard blumenthal (d-conn.) told kavanaugh at the hearing.
but some people with serious medical conditions or looking to keep comprehensive coverage would have owed more ― so much more, in some instances, that they couldn't get insurance at all.
partly that's because other health care topics, like the debate over medicare for all, have been in the news. and partly that's because even conservative experts think the lawsuit's underlying argument is ridiculous.
in montana, gov. steve bullock, who is challenging gop sen. steve daines, is airing ads highlighting how his willingness to work with gop legislators to pass medicaid expansion has helped keep the state's rural hospitals open and prove his bipartisan credentials.

progressive activist ady barkan made an emotional pitch for presidential nominee joe biden at the democratic national convention on tuesday night, warning that health care for millions of americans is at stake in november's election.
one of those professors, jonathan adler of case western university, has since pointed out yet another way recent gop actions have undermined the new case. by passing various measures that have modified the affordable care act, adler noted on twitter, congress has made clear its understanding that zeroing out the mandate did not negate the rest of the law.
but axios' mike allen reported tuesday that breitbart's bomb was one that ryan opponents had been husbanding for months, waiting to detonate at a time of maximum vulnerability.
poll after poll shows james, a young black conservative entrepreneur and iraq war veteran, within single digits of peters, a first-term senator who is perhaps most known for being unknown. the matchup is one of the gop's few chances to oust an incumbent democratic senator, and the result could hinge on that slice of undecided voters.
acting assistant attorney general brent snyder of the justice department's antitrust division said the ruling had prevented american consumers from facing higher health insurance premiums and less innovation.
but the willingness of members to go along with any bill may actually weaken pelosi's hand.
cawthorn is still favored, but davis has released internal polling showing him beating the young republican. if that's true, it will likely signal a statewide swing in north carolina, where biden is proving to be competitive and there's a high-profile senate race.

beto o'rourke, the former democratic congressman from texas now running for president, has endorsed medicare for america by name. other democratic presidential candidates, such as south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, have made statements that suggest they might prefer something like medicare for america ― even if, as in the case of warren, they remain co-sponsors of the sanders bill.
while the cases skewed toward low-wage jobs, the field with the second-most complaints after retail was hospitals and healthcare facilities, which accounted for 62 of the 376 cases. nurses may be more familiar with the law and willing to file complaints, but they also have just as hard a time getting breaks as many retail workers. even hospitals with baby-friendly designations due to their breastfeeding services failed to provide their own employees with the time needed to pump.
the affordable care act initially imposed a financial penalty on people who elected not to have health insurance coverage. in the previous case, called nfib v. sebelius, conservative lawyers backed by the republican party said congress had no authority to impose that kind of penalty. roberts and the four liberal justices disagreed, arguing that the penalty was just another form of taxation, which the constitution clearly permits.
because he perceives health care as a right, senator sanders expects the government to absorb the cost of providing it, no matter how great the financial burden. while sanders believes the top 1 percent of the country to pay for it, he forgets that he himself is a part of that group. his income as a congressman alone puts him in the top 1 percent of earners. is bernie ready to pay for our health care? according to senator cruz, if we confiscated all the wealth from the wealthy, we would not have enough revenue to carry for one year the additional costs of a single-payer system. so, if we confiscate the assets of the rich, who would provide health care to all americans after the first year?
they argue the medical groups would be forced to violate their religious beliefs and perform harmful medical transition procedures or else suffer massive financial liability, according to the lawsuit filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of texas.
that's not meant to be an exhaustive list. we published a paper, which i'm sure you've read, that looked at the five or six efforts toward either single payer or universal coverage, we published last week, and looked at what went well, what didn't go well and are there any lessons to learn. one of the lessons to learn was unless you have a financing strategy, [passing reforms] becomes [a challenge].
they're not listening to national policy experts and research and analysis, said gilda jacobs, president of the michigan league for public policy, a research institute that focuses on poverty-related issues. but maybe, just maybe, today they'll listen to the head of our state government and the ultimate advocate for our state residents.

ahead of opening arguments, collins joined republicans in voting against several democratic motions to subpoena witnesses and documents during the impeachment trial. in explaining her decision, she said she first needed to hear the case and ask questions.
for now, democrats were happy to end a government shutdown, fund the children's health insurance program for six years, and functionally not give up any of their leverage.
the question, then, is whether the momentum can carry into 2018. along the way will be the november 2017 elections in virginia and new jersey. the garden state should be easy to pick off for democrats, given their statewide advantage and the cellar-level popularity of gov. chris christie (r).
we've proven kentuckians are hungry for a new kind of leadership, one that puts working people and their struggles before corporate special interests and the corrupt politicians who serve them, booker said in his statement. let's dedicate to the work of beating mitch, so that we can get him out of the way.
healthcare.gov will be accepting applications through may 15, a period about twice as long as annual open enrollment. the centers for medicare and medicaid services, which runs the program, has a $50 million advertising budget, five times what the trump administration would spend on annual open enrollment. under biden, there will be a special emphasis on reaching black and latino communities that have borne a heavy burden from covid-19.
washington ― some members of congress have suggested that leaders won't care about zika until the mosquitoes are in their districts.

biden has sought to make trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic a central theme of his campaign. at last week's nearly all-virtual democratic convention, biden warned the country was in for additional pain if it allows trump four more years in office.
but what is most notable about this obvious lie is not the refusal to acknowledge the gop's past record, but rather what it says about the party's future intentions. if republicans will lie about their past votes to end health care protections, then one can count on them to do so again if they maintain control of congress.

the uncertainty now is over what the supreme court will do. it takes four votes to agree to hear a case but five votes to do so on an expedited basis. in the lower courts, this case has followed partisan lines. both o'connor and the two 5th circuit judges upholding his ruling were appointed by republicans; the 5th circuit judge who dissented was appointed by a democrat.
monday's appearance from former ohio gov. john kasich, a republican, drew criticism because of kasich's history of fighting unions and working to restrict abortion rights. but kasich was able to directly rebut another major trump argument: that biden would be a feeble-minded tool of the more radical elements of his party.
you listen to all arguments, kavanaugh said.
meanwhile: president donald trump's commission on election integrity is facing significant hurdles, as multiple state election officials have said they will not comply with the panel's request this week for specific, sensitive voter information. even some republican officials have said that they may be opposed to or prohibited from releasing such information or that they're otherwise willing to do only the bare minimum in satisfying the trump commission's demands kansas secretary of state kris kobach (r), the commission's vice chair who signed the letter sent to the states on wednesday, told the kansas city star that his state would not release the last four digits of voters' social security numbers because that information is not publicly available.

biden's reference to his whole career is telling. he entered the senate in 1973, and for much of his career, the upper chamber was ripe for across-the-aisle partnerships, with plenty of conservative democrats (mostly from the south) and liberal republicans (mostly from the northeast) ready to cut deals.

huffpost's paige lavender dropping some truth on 'morning joe.′ friday morning, while reflecting on the insults, scarborough claimed that trump has changed. 'the guy that's in the white house now is not the guy we knew two years ago,' scarborough said. 'the guy that's in the white house now is not even close.'... that scarborough and brzezinski are only now recognizing trump's penchant for sexist, offensive insults doesn't mean he's changed. it just means they've had the privilege of not feeling subjected to his rhetoric. welcome to the real world, guys. [huffpost]
the deals were announced at a time when former president barack obama's national healthcare reform law was fully in place and the four insurers were growing in the individual insurance market it established. the insurers said new costs, from higher taxes to investments in new obamacare products, were driving their need for scale.
the first are called premium tax credits, which reduce monthly premiums and are available on a sliding scale to people with incomes between the poverty level and 400% of that amount (about $51,000 a year for a single person). in addition, those who earn between poverty and 250% of poverty ― about $32,000 for an individual ― can receive cost-sharing reductions″ that shrink their deductibles, copayments and the like.
we are in conversations ― initial conversations with [the centers for medicare & medicaid services] to understand if that could be utilized in this way, kadlec said.
she didn't seem particularly concerned about it going anywhere, though. that may be because it's been 2,288 days since president barack obama signed the affordable care act, and despite dozens of repeal votes and vows to replace the law with something better, all republicans have to show for their efforts is a 37-page document that looks more like a wish list than a serious health care plan.
because these plans now had comprehensive benefits and because insurers could no longer deny them to people with preexisting medical conditions, they were more expensive.
rural hospitals, like their urban counterparts, are forced to absorb those costs. but unlike bigger hospitals, their patient volumes and operating margins are so low that uncompensated care burdens can be crippling.
no hearings. no witnesses. no amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. no regular order. no bipartisanship. former rep. joe crowley, d-n.y.
and now, democrats say they plan to use the suit to their advantage when trump picks his supreme court nominee, expected to be announced july 9.
28 million americans depend on the affordable care act, otherwise known as obamacare, for their health insurance. not only that, but millions of americans depend on the preventive services that obamacare mandates without cost sharing, deductibles, or copayments. trump is evil. — eugene gu, md (@eugenegu) june 27, 2020
no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before ― and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before.
jerry lewis and tim meadows both portrayed the lead characters in films—from 1961 and 2000, respectively—that, though very different in plot and style (and reception), shared what title? (the ladies man)
it was also clearer than ever this week that trump has absolutely no idea what he's talking about on health care ― other than the droning in his head that obamacare is a total and complete disaster. he obviously doesn't know or care what is in the house or senate bills, including that the bills are fundamentally a tax cut for the rich that leaves pretty much every health care consumer worse off. he just wants to sign something, anything, because his entire presidency is driven by revenge for getting ribbed by obama six years ago at the white house correspondents dinner.
sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) again brought up executive power, reminding kavanaugh that he once said a president could be prosecuted for a dastardly act.
the trump administration is now taking the nearly unprecedented step of refusing to defend the law against a legal challenge from elected gop officials in 20 states.
obamacare is no good. it's shot, it's broke, it's not working, pence said in another campaign video. [the] trump-pence administration tried to do something ― congress didn't help them. i want to help them.
but one year earlier, according to several former officials, biden was among the many advisers urging president barack obama not to pursue comprehensive health care reform right away ― either because it would distract from addressing the economic crisis, or because similar efforts had been disastrous for previous democratic presidencies, or both.
we call it 'adverse selection.' you might call it 'proper selection,' because people who need the care are getting the care, said berwick, who led the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services in 2010 and 2011 during obama's first term and oversaw early aspects of affordable care act implementation.
trump knows what he said was false, too. or maybe he just doesn't actually understand what obamacare is?
perhaps intuiting that if the courts do what he asked them to do and blow up the health care system, voters might blame him and his party, trump swiftly began making laughable claims that the gop was this close to solving the obamacare replacement riddle.
at least for now, it's up to the states ― and cities ― to act.
local officials nationwide say they're focused on creating a positive vision and a constant stream of activities to keep these new activists engaged.
but as public opinion over obamacare proved, voters' feelings about the specific provisions of a law often have little bearing on their feelings about the law as a whole. despite their support for features of obamacare that republicans seek to eliminate, 72 percent of trump voters strongly oppose the existing health care law, according to the aarp poll.
it's true that some people could potentially access less-expensive insurance under the trump administration's deregulatory agenda. but those gains come with risks for the consumers. if you qualify for a health plan that screens based on pre-existing conditions or buy a policy with huge gaps in coverage, you might be left in the lurch when you really need care.
canova has criticized wasserman schultz for her support of the payday lending industry and the trans-pacific partnership trade deal, issues that are near and dear to the hearts of many who don't normally ante up political contributions. we are not taking a penny from any corporate interests, unlike my opponent debbie wasserman schultz, who has been bathing in corporate money for years, canova wrote to opensecrets blog. we are truly a grassroots campaign.
seema verma, chief administrator of center for medicare and medicaid services, has been a vocal proponent of the work requirements ― arguing last year that they are not some subversive attempt to just kick people off of medicaid … their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.
in the current campaign cycle, wasserman schultz has taken significant funds from corporate political action committees -- $451,652 from business pacs, plus another $160,000 from organized labor pacs and $144,209 from ideological pacs. canova has received just $14,000 from pacs, mainly from organized labor.

according to the mayor, 600,000 new yorkers who currently are uninsured would be eligible for existing programs he wants to expand and for a new medical care program. based on that figure, the uninsured rate in new york city is about 7 percent, the same as new york state and lower than the national rate of 10 percent as of 2017, according to census data.

isn't fiscal responsibility as a static concept or end in itself dead as a political goal? and, if not, shouldn't it just depend on whether inflation is a problem at a given moment?
for the first component, warren would forbid insurance practices that she dubbed cheat[ing] people, including drawing narrow boundaries for the network of health care providers they cover and rescinding coverage of certain drugs in the middle of the year.

but coverage for every american would change significantly. the affordable care act's guarantee that insurance companies can't deny coverage based on preexisting conditions would go away, reopening the door for insurers to reject customers based on their medical histories or charging them exorbitant prices that are higher than those assessed to healthier policyholders.
i was shocked and disappointed and angry, he said. no women should be subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace.
the outcome of this year's primary could determine which party controls the u.s. senate next january. national republicans believe either ward or arpaio would lose to rep. kyrsten sinema, the all-but-certain democratic nominee to replace flake. republicans have a 51-49 advantage in the senate, and a sinema victory is essential to democratic hopes of retaking the chamber.

speaking at a breakfast hosted by the christian science monitor, corker outlined the potential box canyon that republicans could find themselves in if they repeal all of the taxes imposed by the affordable care act on the front end. if there's a need to further extend the existing subsidies for lower- income health care recipients beyond the three-year bridge under discussion or if the replacement plan features refundable tax credits down the road, that means republicans would have to vote for a tax increase. corker said to the reporters in attendance that the result could be an extension of current policy driven as much by inertia as by anything else.

because the measure was passed on a purely partisan basis (not one democrat voted for the bill), it is unlikely that democrats will be inclined to repair it, policy experts say. and, because of its errors, the tax legislation likely will add far more to the u.s. deficit over ten years than the $1.5 trillion the bill was designed to cost, jeopardizing the nation's credit rating and fueling fears of cuts in social security and medicare. indeed, after spending more than a year insisting that the law must not run up the nation's debt, republicans added more to the debt with this legislation than any single tax bill in the past three decades, records show.
during an event thursday at northeast iowa community college in peosta, trump was very excited to report that incredible numbers of people were signing up for association health plans, a form of coverage his administration is making easier to buy. he's right about one thing: that truly is incredible, in that it's the opposite of credible.
brewer, meanwhile, said this election was the first time in her time as an organizer that the grassroots was really accepted in the process. instead of us being the agitators, we were a part of the conversation. and i really commend the beshear campaign for that.
but these bigger profits come at the expense of hospitals, doctors, employers, the government, and, ultimately, taxpayers and consumers.
but literally any of the major democratic presidential candidates want government doing a lot more to help people get insurance, while republicans prefer it doing a lot less. and the republicans are making serious headway ― more, perhaps, than many democratic voters realize.
but some outreach emails went out on friday anyway, and it wasn't clear whether the trump administration had always intended to continue the email effort, whether administration officials had changed their minds, or whether the friday emails were the result of some kind of administrative error.
we often frame problems in ways that make it impossible for those on the other side to take that first step towards us. for example, why focus on pro-choice allegiance when most republicans already share the root value of wanting to reduce unwanted pregnancies? we don't have to risk roe v. wade to acknowledge that some people have legitimate, non-hateful reasons for being abortion-averse. why force them into a binary decision that can only divide?
''you're blaming the messenger,'' spicer told the new york times in 2004, when he was spokesman for the house budget committee, referring to republican lawmakers complaining that a previous gop-appointed cbo director wasn't giving them the answers they wanted.
this could take the form of high-risk pools, which is a reform republicans have long favored. prior to the aca making them obsolete, these high-risk pools existed in a majority of states, dating back to the 1970s. inadequate funding, high premiums and lengthy waiting lists meant only a tiny percentage of people otherwise uninsurable had access to this coverage.

murtaugh again attacked biden's plan. and burnett wasn't having it.
most importantly, we need a new kind of american and global leadership, whether someone holds a political office or not. for sure, it cannot just be an endless line of people running for political office—women, people of color, lgbtq people, disabled americans, others. no. there is a reason why countless people detest and do not trust politicians.
asked about the potential for that death spiral, sen. ted cruz (r-texas) suggested the skinny repeal bill would not be the final product. this is a legislative process, he said. this is a journey. and we're not there yet.
but california v. texas is coming before the supreme court because three federal judges, one from a federal district in texas and two on the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, already found its logic compelling. all three are republican appointees, which almost certainly helps explain why they ruled as they did. obamacare has been the subject of relentless attacks ― and the object of monomaniacal hatred ― on the political right since president barack obama signed it in 2010.
for years, we've called for ahps to ensure that heath care coverage is within reach for small retailers and their employees, and today's action by dol brings us one step closer to making this common sense reform a reality, david french, senior vice president for government relations at the national retail federation, said.
under the affordable care act, if you buy insurance through healthcare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges, you can get tax credits that help offset the cost of premiums. these are special tax credits, in that they go straight to the insurance companies at the beginning of each month, so you don't have to wait until tax-filing season to get the money.
the freedom caucus is meeting late thursday night to discuss where members stand, but if they follow through on promises to oppose it without more of their demands being met, they can sink the bill and motivate moderates to oppose it as well.
just one year later (in 2013), a cbs news poll, using identical language to the pew center survey, found a slight increase – up to 30 percent - in the number of americans willing to allow a state to secede provided that a majority of residents wanted to do so. when asked about the type of people who might want their state to secede from the union, more than 1 in 3 (34 percent) described these respondents as mostly patriots while slightly less than 1 in 3 (31 percent) described them as mostly traitors. roughly equal percentages (17%) described them as neither patriot nor traitor or said they didn't know what type of people they were.
shealy, who now works in mold and asbestos mediation and has a certification in rod busting, said that he had a political awakening while he was serving time. his understanding of the many ways black men are disenfranchised grew deeper, and he began reimagining how he could positively impact his community.
are those employees having tremendous problems? possibly. people who earn too much for subsidies on the exchanges have no protection from the rate hikes next year.
my perspective is that we can't afford to live in that situation. i'll give it to you numerically: there were 22 republicans that voted no on the house bill [to repeal the aca]. there were three senators. imagine if that 22 were 40? imagine if that three were 10? and those aren't unimaginable things. now they're unimaginable in the next two years. but they're not unimaginable over the long term, particularly if the populace of the american public makes it very, very clear that that's where we need to go.

again, she leaned on her military experience and her outsider status. but early missteps ― including a waffling position on whether she would have supported justice brett kavanaugh's nomination to the supreme court ― caused some angst among democrats about her candidacy and helped create the atmosphere in which booker's progressive campaign later thrived.
the republican party has become intellectually and morally bankrupt, a mockery of its traditions -- corrosive to our society, our civility, and our capacity to govern. this is not a temporary condition; it is woven into the fabric of the party. unless and until it reverses course, you should take your votes and money and walk away.
however the judge rules, the losing party is likely to appeal, setting up yet another protracted fight that could go all the way to the supreme court. along the way, it could make insurance markets less stable by giving insurers and state officials reasons to wonder how long the law will be around.
on tuesday, house gop leadership told its members that they needed to get out there and start talking more about the tax cut law, because right now, it's not at the top of the public's minds.

this is a unique situation, right? congressional progressive caucus co-chair mark pocan (d-wis.) said. if it was just that they were keeping us away, it would be one thing. but, you know, it's the attending physician who right now is keeping us away.
before trump, republicans generally liked free trade. mcconnell had one asterisk on his anti-obama opposition: he actually wanted to help obama pass the trans-pacific partnership trade deal with 11 other nations. yet even with a sympathetic president and republican majorities in both the house and senate, the gop leadership somehow couldn't get it done. the weight of this responsibility falls more heavily on house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) than on mcconnell, but it remains an impressive failure for the senator.
the best argument for a single-payer health plan is the recent decision by giant health insurer aetna to bail out next year from 11 of the 15 states where it sells obamacare plans.aetna's decision follows similar moves by unitedhealth group, the nation's largest health insurer, and by humana, another one of the giants.
when president donald trump decided to plunge the country into a partial government shutdown, republican leaders in congress warned him against doing so.
zero cost-sharing is relatively unusual internationally. most systems require at least some out-of-pocket spending, although it's usually a lot smaller and waived entirely for the poor and for treatment of cancer, diabetes and other chronic conditions.
this could mean the difference between life and death for so many americans, becerra said wednesday. for now, at least, president trump got his gift that he wanted: uncertainty in the health care market and a pathway for the repeal of the affordable care act.
during an appearance on the ellen degeneres show, obama was greeted with a valentine's day message from his wife, first lady michelle obama.degeneres told the president she'd help him return the gesture, providing him with a red backdrop, floral arrangements and a camera to film his own valentine's day greeting.

the fact is, of the top 20 most poverty stricken states, six of them (west virginia, new mexico, indiana, oregon, montana and california) are yet to vote. and with over one in five people in new mexico below the poverty line according to poverty usa, it's an outrage that candidates aren't trying harder to fix this crisis.
environmental justice and climate change: studies and polls show that latinos are deeply concerned about pollution and support regulations that protect our natural resources. the next president can win over latinos by clearly advocating for strong environmental protections. for example, more than 70 percent of latino respondents in colorado, new mexico, florida and illinois support the clean water act and the protection of wetlands. why? latinos often live in urban settings where green areas are sparse, and suffer from chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes. access to green spaces is also why latinos organized this year to support reauthorization of the land and water conservation fund, which invests earnings from offshore oil and gas leasing to help strengthen communities, preserve our history and protect our national endowment of lands and waters. the fund expires in 2018 and latinos will be looking to the white house to lead the charge on reauthorization. another key issue area for latinos is climate change. latinos disproportionately suffer its effects because we are much more likely to work outdoors than not, and because many of us live in coastal areas. because of this, more than three-fourths (77 percent) of latino voters believe that global climate change is already happening -- impressive when compared to the general public (52 percent). hispanics are also more likely to support policies aimed at curbing it.
de blasio argued that only a clear progressive could excite voters enough to put the white house back in democratic hands.

to illustrate the difference, the buttigieg campaign documents cited a hypothetical example: a 60-year-old in iowa with an annual income of $50,000. today, that iowan has the option to buy a silver plan for $12,000 in premiums over the course of a year, according to the campaign. under the buttigieg plan, that 60-year-old could get a more generous gold plan while paying just $4,250 in premiums.
the washington post via getty images breitbart news has set its sights on house speaker paul ryan.
yet, trump is playing for high stakes. he is acting like the republican nomination is his, and he is in the general election campaign. he is telegraphing to many democrats and independents that he not a republican apologist. but he also is damaging what's left of the republican brand and depreciating the legacy of the most recent republican president. still, his heavy attacks on jeb, cruz and other republicans (some now out of the race) have telegraphed to some republican voters that trump is tough enough for november.

that has changed over time, as even many gop-controlled states have joined the expansion ― either because governors and state lawmakers decided to embrace it or because voters approved expansion via ballot initiatives. but even today, roughly one-third of the states still have not expanded their programs.

if special elections are a sign of things to come ― and they may or may not be ― signs are good for democrats so far. in two specials in iowa, in december and january, on the eastern border in davenport, democrats won by larger-than-expected margins. iowa allows absentee balloting, which allows organizers to go door to door to make sure those ballots are being filled out and mailed in. in the state senate race in december, democrats collected 2,163 ballots. on election day, the democrat won only 1,640 votes, meaning more people voted absentee than in person, suggesting an extraordinarily high level of organization and energy on the ground. the same pattern held for the house race.
according to data from the baldwin campaign, outside groups have spent $6.3 million against her. about $3.1 million of that has come from groups connected to illinois billionaire dick uihlein, who is supporting nicholson. and $3 million has come from groups affiliated with the conservative megadonors, charles and david koch.

in alaska and minnesota, state officials faced remarkably similar situations, with premiums that put insurance out of reach for consumers who got little or no financial aid. they responded very differently than their counterparts in des moines. they created reinsurance pools that reimburse carriers for their most expensive-to-cover beneficiaries. premiums fell in both states, and just this past week officials in wisconsin said they were going to try the same thing.
trump threatened for months last year to cut off payments that the federal government owed insurance companies serving low-income obamacare customers and, in october, he finally did it.

rhetoric from the trump administration that they will let affordable care act marketplaces fail along with lack of interest in taking measures to keep insurers in its exchanges, compounded with renewed talks by republicans on the hill over repealing and replacing the aca, is a perfect storm for market uncertainty and a self-fulfilling explosion. this was no more evident than in donald trump's speech after the american health care act bill was pulled from the house floor without a vote.
dealing with the concerns of approximately 700,000 people
this is why the pharmaceutical industry is among the groups fighting these reforms. and that resistance makes a big difference.
the measure was chief among the reasons aarp, the nation's largest organization for older americans, cited in explaining its opposition to the house bill on tuesday evening.
don't insurance companies dominate these organizations? actually, insurers are not in the majority of decision making of either organization. they are at the table because they have a huge stake in deciding what to pay for, since they must distribute resources fairly to all patients who are members. researchers and medical personnel are much more heavily represented on these boards and panels, because the complexity of research design is something that even insurance companies don't always understand. and icer seeks direct input from patients and clinicians on what they feel is important to their care, what outcomes they seek, and what evidence should be assessed. for example, multiple myeloma patient groups told icer that it was very important to them to have options for oral medication given how often they have to go to clinics for iv administration.
bryan r. smith/getty images ed mcginty, a 71-year old retiree from philadelphia, wears a biden 2020 hat on july 23. as trump's popularity plummets among senior citizens, he has scrambled to issue last-minute executive orders aimed at lowering drug prices.
it's also an open question how quickly insurers can prepare and market new plans ― and how states will react. some states are already doing what they can to block the new changes by using their insurance regulatory authority to keep the obama-era restrictions in place.
a coalition of democratic state attorneys general led by california's xavier becerra stepped up to defend the law. the u.s. house of representatives intervened after democrats won control in november's elections during which many focused their campaigns on defending obamacare.
in retrospect, support for the affordable care act when it was newly enacted looks downright robust. when president barack obama's health care law passed in march 2010, it faced similar levels of opposition, but considerably higher levels of favor: on average, about 42 percent of americans supported it. yet even those comparatively rosy numbers were enough to leave democrats ducking furious constituents and, according to some research, helped doom the party to a historic midterm election defeat later that year.
wing-heier, from alaska, says she has seen this happen before. you fill out the form, the medical forms, you think you are being honest about your history, and then the insurers go through your records and find something that you didn't think was an issue, your doctor didn't think was an issue, but now the insurer is saying it's a pre-existing condition.
both would create a public option open to all people, give government new power to negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical industry over the price of prescription drugs, limit surprise billing from doctors and hospitals, and improve the financial assistance available to people buying coverage on their own through healthcare.gov or one of the state-based exchanges, including covered california.
sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), who would be one of the most likely democratic targets of outreach from this white house, said that although he discussed his support for parts of obamacare with trump during a white house meeting in february, he has not received a call to discuss reform efforts more generally.
then, of course, there is the effort to repeal the affordable care act altogether ― either through the judiciary, where a new lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality is awaiting a ruling from a federal appeals court, or through congress, where gop leaders have made clear they will make another attempt at repeal if the 2020 election gives them full control of the government again.
the penalty had several purposes, chief among them to make sure healthy people signed up for coverage before getting sick. in 2012, the supreme court upheld the mandate as a legitimate use of congressional authority to levy taxes.
in the end, the new regulation could allow some people ― especially those who find current coverage unaffordable ― to buy ultra-cheap, relatively skimpy plans.
the house and democratic states then argued that an ultimate decision on the lawsuit is needed quickly to remove the uncertainty involving the health care system for the 20 million people who currently rely on it. they're calling on the nation's high court to uphold the law and overrule the decision by the lower court.
the task of rejuvenating downtrodden kentucky democrats is not a new one for the beshear family: in 2007, steve beshear ― andy's father, and a former lieutenant governor, attorney general and state representative ― easily defeated scandal-prone gov. ernie fletcher, whose victory four years prior broke democrats' three-decade hold on the governorship and was supposed to turn kentucky red for good.
sandoval, who opted to expand medicaid under obamacare for nevada's neediest residents, said he likes what he's heard so far about a replacement for the law. but the governor added there are a lot of lives at stake with its possible repeal and said he hoped congressional leaders would take them into consideration.
many fewer remember how then-sen. evan bayh, a democrat from indiana, insisted on concessions to the medical device industry. those concessions involved easing up on a tax the industry faced, which rendered it even harder for lawmakers to make the health care budgeting work.
in the past, democrats have been preoccupied with implementing the law and fending off efforts to destroy it. that was especially true last year, when president donald trump and his republican allies came within a single senator's vote of passing repeal legislation.
if that doesn't happen and barrett ends up with the case in front of her, one open question is how much she would think about the court's standing with the public ― and whether she contemplates the consequences of a decision to strike down the health care law.
republican leaders like house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) haven't gone that far, at least not yet. the draft legislation that leaked last week still had refundable credits, and looked a lot like the plan that health and human services secretary tom price had proposed when he was in congress last year. the better way proposal, a set of reform principles that ryan released over the summer, also had refundable credits. president donald trump also endorsed tax credits during his speech to congress on tuesday night, although he didn't specify what kind.
planned parenthood announced on tuesday that it will no longer be part of the federal title x program, which provides contraception and other family planning services to low-income individuals. the group, which treats more than 40% of the roughly 4 million people who benefit from title x, said it could not in good conscience abide by new administration rules that restrict how its clinics could talk about abortion.
that gets states more engaged, slavitt said. it creates different solutions and, as far as i'm concerned, so long as you're meeting the core requirement of covering more people with high-quality benefits, let the states experiment.
i can only say that i have the highest, utmost respect for the office of the inspector general, jorjani replied.
it's part of a broader effort by the states that have most aggressively implemented the affordable care act to protect their markets from republican sabotage efforts. two states, new jersey and vermont, have enacted their own versions of the individual mandate, joining massachusetts, which has had a mandate since 2007.
in august of 2015 he says planned parenthood is important, but it should be defunded after the allegations were made that the government-funded organization was using aborted fetuses for research.
if the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals, which is weighing the lawsuit, agrees with the government, the matter will almost certainly go before the supreme court, which has already turned away two major challenges to the 2010 health care law. with two new trump-picked justices on the high court, however, there is no telling whether the law would survive a third.
the case for squeezing hospitals is strong, given the available research on what they charge and why. even some experts historically wary of government regulation are warming to the concept.
gideon highlighted mcconnell's promise of financial support for gop sen. susan collins, while greenfield claimed her opponent, sen. joni ernst, voted with mcconnell 99% of the time.
the obama health law now covers more than 20 million people through a combination of subsidized private plans and, in most states, expanded medicaid.
but collins is not as much of a maverick as people give her credit for. she was hailed as a hero for blocking a gop bill to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood, but she has also voted to confirm at least five anti-abortion judges to lifetime positions on federal courts. and she voted to confirm gorsuch, trump's first supreme court pick, who sided with anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers in a case this year.
why else the case makes no sense
in may 2017, after the house voted narrowly to pass its version of repeal legistlation, the gop caucus held a celebratory event with trump at the white house. slotkin has said frequently that seeing bishop smiling and beaming in the rose garden is what convinced her to run because she remembers what happened to her mother ― a breast cancer survivor who lost her job, wasn't able to get insurance and then struggled to pay for care after a diagnosis of stage 4 ovarian cancer.
here is the truth: trump has no idea what he wants to do about the serious flaws in the american health care system.
overall, urban's researchers predict, the number of uninsured people in 2019 should be 4.7 million higher than it would have been if republicans had not touched the affordable care act at all. that reflects a number of smaller shifts in coverage ― including a decline in medicaid enrollment because the mandate encourages people to investigate their insurance options and some inevitably discover they fall within medicaid's eligibility guidelines.
opening the insurance markets is also likely to result in higher medicaid enrollment, since people who qualify for that program are automatically referred.
chris seward/the news & observer via ap after marching 130 miles from rural belhaven, north carolina, to the state capitol in raleigh, protesters in 2015 rally against the closing of their hospital, vidant pungo. medicaid expansion could be the difference between survival and extinction for many rural hospitals.
first, they express wariness of the law's projected impact on medicaid. the american health care act would roll back the expansion of medicaid eligibility and cap funding per recipient. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that this would result in a significant reduction in coverage, as most states would scale back eligibility to what it was before obamacare took effect — and as overall payments for the program failed to keep up with health care costs. older workers have reason to be concerned about medicaid cuts. about 6.5 million medicaid recipients are americans 65 or older who also receive medicare. the program's coverage of nursing home care is especially essential for seniors.
you gotta get 218 votes on the floor of the house to do anything. and then you've gotta figure out a way to get, you know, theoretically, 60 votes in the senate. rep. dan kildee (d-mich.)
i think the likelihood of roe v. wade being overturned is very minimal. i don't see that happening, ernst said monday while facing off against democrat theresa greenfield in a debate hosted by iowa pbs.
(in this vein, a good leader might tell counter-protestors to skip the next charlottesville and go instead as volunteers and witnesses to affected communities. you can't put out a fire by focusing on the flames.)
prior to the pandemic, trump's biggest asset ― and the ultimate populist talking point ― was a roaring economy. as a candidate, trump promised that black americans and the hispanics would love him because of the jobs he created.
but their experiences were not the same.
what happens next will likely depend on the supreme court, where the case is almost certainly headed, although it may be a while before it gets there. the law will remain in place at least until that happens.
republican senators facing reelection this fall have tried to reassure voters that they support those protections which, like obamacare, are broadly popular, even though they've voted in the past to repeal the law. some have even tried to downplay the threat to obamacare in the courts.
my news block did not shield me entirely from world events, or my friends. if i was a person of color, someone with daca status, or of different sexual orientations, i wouldn't have the privilege of working through my feelings to reach for paul across the aisle, and i have no intention of forgetting that. but i've seen too many families torn apart because of a lack of willingness to listen and engage, when the fact is that whatever differences surfaced after the election had been there all along. next month, when paul and i get married, there will be variety among the guests, as well — some rabid republicans, others die-hard democrats. no one will refuse to celebrate love over political differences. i am proud to be among them.
by now, you may be familiar with the arguments. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), author of a leading medicare for all proposal, openly concedes that it will require some new taxes to finance the cost of generous insurance for everybody.
mulvaney and secretary of state mike pompeo were reportedly key players in trump attorney rudy giuliani's attempt to pressure ukraine into launching an investigation into former vice president joe biden and his son, an operation that ultimately led to trump's impeachment. mulvaney insisted that the investigation was intended to expose ukraine, not russia, as the nation that interfered with the 2016 presidential election, a conspiracy theory that runs counter to u.s. intelligence findings.
native americans in any state and alaska natives, however, can enroll through the exchanges at any time.
when huffpost pressed her on whether medicare for all was her ultimate ambition, she said her end goal was to ensure that every american has access to high-quality health care in this country.
it's impossible to say definitively right now because the answer depends on some key details still missing from the existing proposals. the sanders bill, for example, doesn't specify which taxes it would raise. it also doesn't indicate exactly how the new program would pay doctors, hospitals and other providers of medical care.
one advantage of a more gradual transition would be the opportunity for self-correction, as linda blumberg, a senior fellow at the urban institute, explained: you can start to feel whether you are causing major supply reductions and make policy decisions as you go along.
chip somodevilla/pool via ap rep. dan crenshaw, r-texas, is being challenged by former beto o'rourke adviser sima ladjevardian.
if the supreme court rules that obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than obamacare, trump told reporters in the white house wednesday, according to a pool report. on tuesday, he said, the republican party will soon be known as the party of health care. you watch. he later tweeted the same thing.
cohn is the author of sick: the untold story of america's health care crisis ― and the people who pay the price and the forthcoming the ten year war: obamacare and the unfinished crusade for universal coverage. his coverage of health care policy is a go-to for wonks and anyone who wants to better understand how our system works and what could be done to improve it.
that last part is important because it has directly undermined how the new system is supposed to work. insurers need healthy people paying into the system so that there's enough money to cover the high medical bills of the people with serious health problems.
heller will probably have to do more than monitor closely. he may have to oppose his party, because many of his colleagues ― even ones who represent large rural populations ― are determined to proceed with the gop's repeal and replace plan.
the spend-down for people with disabilities is 80% of the poverty level, or $792 per month.
these plans generally aren't available to people with pre-existing conditions and don't include many essential benefits, which means people who manage to get them are risking financial ruin if they get seriously ill. and by drawing healthy people out of the broader pool, these new plans will force insurers to jack up rates, forcing people with pre-existing conditions to pay more for coverage.
now more than ever, we must make the case that medicaid matters.
a ruling against the law would be a conservative coup
in addition to anxiety about the aca disappearing, buckholt fears for a future in which her daughters' preexisting conditions make it impossible to get coverage.
the trump budget also promises a $3 billion increase — to $25 billion — for nasa in hopes of returning astronauts to the moon and on to mars. it touts a beefed-up, 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure proposal, but $800 billion of that comes through existing surface transportation programs. it contains a modest parental leave plan championed by first daughter ivanka trump and includes $135 billion in savings over the coming decade as part of an unspecified set-aside to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs this year.
jim watson/getty images democratic presidential nominee joe biden rejected president donald trump's assertions that he has adopted the most far-reaching proposals of his party's left wing.

these consequences would extend beyond those consumers who currently get their health insurance from the affordable care act's exchange marketplaces or directly from insurers.
if the affordable care act were not law, if the u.s. health care system still looked like it did before, the number of uninsured and under-insured americans would be dramatically higher. and there would be fewer options for the millions losing income and jobs in the coming months, as the pandemic-stricken economy grinds to a halt.
but once the new system launched in 2014, many insurers simply stopped offering their old policies. when americans with those plans found out, they were furious.
14 million is larger than the population of sã o paulo, brazil, and 1.5 times more than that of cairo.
there are already at least 11 million illegal immigrants in our country. the march 2012 current population survey, which is a bit dated, provided this data.
why is michigan one of the states where obamacare is having an easier time? in places like california, where obamacare is working best, support from state officials has been a huge factor.
he boasted about building about 300 miles of border wall. what he didn't say is that most of that is replacement barrier. as of aug. 7, according to official data, just five miles have been built where none existed before.
if mcconnell keeps his word, he'll put speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) in a tough spot. there is a daca bill currently working its way through the house that would deliver on a number of conservative immigration priorities, but it has no chance in the senate.
but the main focus lately has been on the affordable care act's insurance regulations, which include requirements that all policies carry 10 essential benefits and a prohibition on insurers charging higher premiums or denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
if the passage of roe led to an invigoration of the anti-abortion movement, will its reversal do the same for the abortion rights forces? trying to find a silver lining, many in that camp believe it will.
private sector companies used to routinely provide some form of subsidized health coverage for older workers who they employed for a fixed number of years. those retiree health plans are now rarely seen outside the public sector.
at the same time, gross described his views on some social issues as more conservative. when it comes to gun policy, for example, he supports universal background checks but opposed a ban on military-style assault rifles.
but when trump pressed biden on why he and obama had not passed some of the additional reforms he was now seeking to implement as president, biden had a sheepish response.
at the time, kavanaugh said he was not involved in the bush administration's torture program when he worked in the white house. later reports suggested otherwise, and durbin argued today that kavanaugh provided inaccurate and misleading testimony.
why can't middle class families get good coverage at an affordable price? warren asked on thursday.
several career attorneys at justice refused to put their name on the administration's brief, and one longtime lawyer left the department immediately afterward, which suggests the decision to side with the plaintiffs didn't sit well with them ― that they concluded the administration's action on this case was more about politics than law, and just another salvo in president donald trump's ongoing war against obamacare.
as veterans choice expands, the confusion around the program that persists among veterans must be addressed with dedicated outreach and education. part of this needs to be a listening/ learning program that applies the feedback of veterans to guide this period of program expansion.
cruz was the first person to announce his candidacy in the 2016 presidential race, way back in march 2015, on the five-year anniversary of obamacare becoming law.
recent policy battles in arizona, one of several gop-controlled states experiencing a backlash, including threatened teacher strikes, after years of fiscal austerity, have created a ready-made corps of activists primed to canvass for tipirneni. many of the same women knocking on doors for tipirneni now had already mobilized against a bill in the state legislature expanding private school vouchers. lesko was a sponsor of the school voucher bill, which has since become a law that's being challenged on the november ballot.
the relationship has long been fraying, with activists asking why progressive organizations weren't working harder to elect a democrat who would be on their side all the time.
schumer and other democrats also pointed to alarms raised by hospitals, the american medical association and others in the health care sector that the repeal and delay plan would wreak havoc on a system that's still adapting to the affordable care act overhaul.
the administration was joined by the little sisters of the poor, an roman catholic order of nuns that is one of the groups seeking an exemption for its employees.
just last week, president donald trump boasted that his administration is determined to use every resource at our disposal to smash the grip of addiction.
and it's not just medicare drug benefits that would be subject to this kind of uncertainty. a major goal of the affordable care act was to make health care more efficient and ultimately less expensive, in part by changing the way medicare pays for doctor and hospital services. some large health systems across the country re-engineered their billing systems in order to match the new incentives.
the result will be a parallel insurance market for healthy people to buy bad coverage. and, again, the more healthy people not using the insurance exchanges, the worse it will be for everyone who still must, for they will see their premiums rise.
these are places where there are opportunities to grow and consolidate the risk pool, sarah lueck, a senior policy analyst at the progressive center on budget and policy priorities think tank, told huffpost. lueck, who happens to be an iowa native, has studied the state closely and calls the outreach failure a huge missed opportunity.
but that also means the tax credits will end up putting a greater strain on the federal treasury. the cost of tax credits will go up by about 9 percent, according to the study.
you're going to be very, very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care, he added. we're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.
nearly all of the groups that supported the aca oppose repealing it. and some of them, like hospitals and the aarp, are fighting hard to preserve the new guarantees of coverage ― even as conservative groups fight the measure because they think it doesn't dial back the coverage expansion enough.
having a group of interfaith clergy perform a ceremony focused on unity and wholeness therefore takes on special meaning to empower and celebrate rather than to stigmatize, control and dehumanize, meyers said in a statement released to huffpost. having such a ceremony take place at this moment in history is especially powerful for us as we seek to mobilize our communities of different faiths to come together to affirm and support the reproductive freedoms we cherish and have fought so hard to achieve.
there are now enough young voters to protect health care, but only if we show up, the woman says in the 30-second ad.
the obama administration made these decisions because the whole point of the aca's private insurance reforms was to transform the market for people buying coverage on their own, so that everybody ― healthy and sick, young and old ― was paying into one pool and was part of the same system. that way, insurers would have enough money to cover the bills of people with serious medical conditions.
but this version of the debate was different than previous ones in one important respect. it came one day after a federal appeals court declared a key element of the affordable care act unconstitutional, putting the entire law in jeopardy.
one reason it's difficult to be precise about biden's counsel on health care is that he was not among the advisers who made big impressions during white house deliberations on the issue. biden typically reserved his strongest advice for private, one-on-one conversations with the president, former officials said, and he had his hands full with the rest of his portfolio, which included not just oversight of the recovery act but also scaling back the u.s. military presence in afghanistan and iraq.
the return of the public option
at the time, however, the obama administration saw broadly positive marks for its response to the swine flu. in an october 2009 cnn/orc poll, a 57% majority of americans approved of how president barack obama handled the government response to the swine flu, with 40% disapproving.
the republican approach would be a lot more straightforward, and it would likely mean a lot less federal spending. but it would also mean many fewer people buying insurance, much weaker coverage for those who have it, or both.
when a constituent called the gop health care bill a giveaway to the wealthiest americans, who stand to receive $594 billion in tax cuts over 10 years, macarthur pushed back by claiming that all americans would receive a tax cut under the plan.
lawmakers should have been mindful of that fact when writing the law, said jay soled, director of the masters of accountancy in taxation program at rutgers university.
of course, cutting those reimbursements would mean taking money out of the pockets of doctors and hospitals, drug and device makers, and the rest of the health care industry. these groups were not happy about this prospect and fought hard to repeal ipab, forming and funding advocacy groups with titles like the coalition to protect people's rights and then deploying lobbyists to make the case against ipab in person.
the trump budget is a blueprint written under washington rules as if he could enact it without congressional approval. it relies on rosy economic projections of 2.8% economic growth this year and 3% over the long term — in addition to fanciful claims of future cuts to domestic programs — to show that it is possible to bend the deficit curve in the right direction.
she has been noticeably warm toward kavanaugh since trump nominated him in mid-july, despite her promise that she would not consider a nominee who is hostile to roe. hostile seems to be the key word for her. kavanaugh has criticized the landmark 1973 abortion rights decision in a speech and ruled against abortion rights and birth control access more than once as a federal judge, but she seemed to be satisfied with his answer this month on roe.
just last month, jesimya david scherer-radcliff, a 21-year-old diabetic from rural minnesota, died. his family said it was because he had skipped insulin doses he couldn't afford.
many activists and lawmakers say it would have been better to make the party enrollment deadline for previously registered voters the same as the voter registration deadline, new york state sen. brian kavanagh (d), who sponsored the bill, told huffpost the bill's passage is a big step forward.
he hasn't been serious about really taking on pharma and providing relief to people with really high drug costs, said steve knievel, an advocate in public citizen's access to medicine program.

bryan woolston/associated press mcgrath's missteps allowed state rep. charles booker to make a large charge in the democratic senate primary.
the other issue the media has given chaffetz credit for looking into is the unprecedented situation with trump hotel, where trump is both the tenant and now, technically, as the head of the federal government, the landlord. trump is leasing the historic old post office from the government, and the contract clearly states that no elected official shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.
people that are currently receiving care in kansas are at risk of being priced out of the care, says rinker, who lives in kansas and whose father died of ms. you're pitting kansans against each other.

already, lawmakers are scrambling to help people pay for coronavirus tests and treatment. and it looks like there's a lot more work to do.
the other prong of the gop attack on the affordable care act focuses on its medicaid expansion, under which states agree to open the program to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line.
once again, it started with a court case

but the enthusiasm around booker may have dampened support for her among progressive voters, who've long wanted to see a candidate like him take on mcconnell, and among black voters, who form a small but potentially powerful bloc of support for democratic candidates in kentucky's biggest cities. booker's victories in louisville and lexington, as well as his better-than-expected performance in some key rural and suburban counties, show where mcgrath needs to make up ground in the general election.
i also asked him to respond to skeptics who believe that a fund he has started to invest in health care innovations for low-income people represents a conflict of interest.
but that is not the only big change trump and congressional republicans are making. trump is using his executive authority to undermine obamacare's insurance rules, including those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, as well as some that require insurers to cover 10 essential benefits such as mental health, maternity and prescription drugs.
kenneth stevenson, 62, small business owner
the gop lawsuit argues the entire aca became unconstitutional when republicans zeroed out the fines people used to face under the law's individual mandate. nearly all legal experts view the case as frivolous, but it's still coming before the court just as barrett would potentially get her seat, and after president donald trump's repeated promises to only nominate justices who would overturn the aca.
and the tax cuts, the only significant legislation to pass under trump's watch? while trump's white house participated in crafting the measure, the heart of the bill – a massive and permanent cut to the nation's corporate tax rate – has been a gop priority for many years, and was an important part of the platforms of the other republican presidential candidates in 2016. trump didn't even mention tax cuts in his infamous campaign announcement speech in 2015.
in one of the hottest moments of the debate, booker turned to face biden and called him out for repeatedly name-dropping his service with president barack obama while failing to account for the obama administration's failures.
two other recent surveys didn't ask directly about overall support for the bill, but provide some additional context on how it's seen by the public.
raskin told huffpost there were some 900 people at the trump event. it was one of eight events he did that day and all of them, he said, were bursting.
no one believes the supreme court is going to strike down the affordable care act, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), a longtime opponent of the aca, said monday in kentucky's senate debate against democrat amy mcgrath.
in discussing the proposed plan, rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, said it was apparent that strides [had] been made to address real concerns. critics claim the gop substitute will make it more difficult for people to find affordable medical care. meanwhile, tweeters posted photographs showing how the affordable care act compared to its possible gop replacement.
the effects of a ruling would be devastating
despite these continued inequities, and despite the problems that remain in our society, obama emphasized that while the present day may not be paradise it sure as hell is better than what came before -- for african-americans and for americans more broadly:
gop leadership aides are brushing aside any concerns about the vote going down.
more than 50 million americans have something in their medical histories that could disqualify them from health insurance absent the affordable care act's rules, according to the henry j. kaiser family foundation, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on national health issues.
but roberts was wary of overturning the whole law, as the conservative justices preferred, and over the next few weeks he began to construct an argument to present the individual mandate as a tax, according to biskupic. the obama administration had made that argument too, but it hadn't come up in the initial conversation of the justices, according to the book excerpt.
the democratic national committee on tuesday launched a six-figure television ad campaign, first reported by nbc, called descent, that opens with trump's descent on the trump tower escalators in new york to announce his bid for the presidency in 2015. for the last five years, he's taken america down with him, the narrator intones.
because the gop plaintiffs have sought to have the entire law overturned, the consequences would reach far beyond those who would find themselves immediately uninsured.
mcconnell's promise convinced some democrats to switch their vote. but he wasn't able to make any guarantees about the house, as ryan previously promised the conservative freedom caucus he would not hold immigration votes without support from a majority of the republican conference.
do you not remember during a speech to congress when joe wilson of south carolina yelled out you lie? has any other president in u.s. history ever been treated like that? racist? you tell me.
workers at companies with more than 500 employees were blocked from getting paid sick or family leave through the law, and very small companies were allowed to voluntarily opt out of providing leave. that meant that up to 83% of the workforce was unable to actually get paid time off through that bill, according to one recent analysis from the national partnership for women and families.
republicans could defend their position honestly by saying they believe pre-existing condition protections and other affordable care act provisions inevitably do more harm than good.
and although he vetoed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthiest kentuckians, bevin recently said he would use a second term to end the state income tax in favor of higher sales taxes, which would shift the state's tax burden toward the poor and working classes.
pay your interns, yo - seriously, it's amazing how much talent is out there that doesn't have a parent who gave to your boss' campaign. kaeli subberwal: [a] new pay our interns report titled 'experience doesn't pay the bills: why paid internships are a must in congress.' the report calls unpaid internships 'a blight marring the face of the american job market,' and argues that the scarcity of paid internships on the hill diminishes the likelihood that students of color and low-income students will enter the intern-to-staffer pipeline in congress. this, in turn, leads to a more homogenous government workforce. the extent of the problem the report outlines is startling. in the u.s. senate, 51 percent of republicans pay their interns, while only 31 percent of democrats offer paid internships. the rates in the house of representatives are even worse, with 8 percent of republican representatives and 3.6 percent of democratic representatives paying their interns.

this week, iowa became one of those places. kim reynolds, the state's republican governor, signed a law monday allowing the iowa farm bureau to sell health plans that, in most respects, look and operate like any other insurance policies. wellmark, the state's affiliate of blue cross blue shield, will administer the new policies.
he has not changed from the horrible human being that he's always been, said kendal unruh, a longtime republican activist who was drummed out of her local party in colorado for leading the effort to strip the nomination from trump at the 2016 gop convention. and now the whole world can see him for who he is.
willmann was relieved voters in his district supported the measure to create a hospital taxing district, but he acknowledged that it wasn't a good deal for his county's taxpayers. their federal taxes help pay for the expansion in other states but not in texas.
the angry confrontations have prompted some republicans to cancel town hall appearances altogether.
a history that emphasizes only our crimes and ignores the progress is but the mirror image of one that does the opposite -- one that presents our history as one solely bathed in glory and righteousness. and if those are the only two options, many middle-of-the-road americans, in particular whites but others as well, are likely to be more attracted to the pollyanna-ish view simply because it sounds more familiar and feels better. we progressives have to make sure that we present a balanced picture. that way we can get those people who sometimes forget about the crimes to remember them and to commit to reversing their effects, rather than dismiss our criticisms as anti-american because we [supposedly] talk only about the negatives in our country. we have to present our case as representing the true american values, and contrast them to the values of those whom we oppose.
frank, who is now a professor at harvard, told huffpost that the impact would be even more dramatic today, because since 2017, more states have expanded their medicaid programs. that means more states would now see coverage declines if the affordable care act's funding suddenly vanished. as german lopez, a journalist who has chronicled the epidemic for vox, warned last year, states would end up more vulnerable not just to the current overdose crisis but the next one as well.
i firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we're going through, understanding that they'll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not the government forces them to buy, health and human services secretary tom price said on nbc's meet the press.
so rather than slap a koran, a treatise of sharia law, or obamacare in the face of trump supporters, the pocket constitution symbolizes an american virtue that all americans can agree to― democrat or republican.
that law left some areas open to interpretation and thousands of consumers complain each year about being discriminated against, the u.s. department of health and human services said last year.
but reconciliation rules prohibit consideration of changes that don't directly affect the federal budget, and some of the changes in the draft bill ― like those affecting insurance regulations ― might not pass muster with the senate parliamentarian, an adviser to the senate who interprets those rules.
republican colleagues are queried the general response is, he's a man of great faith.
iowa gov. kim reynolds (r) signed a law this month allowing insurance companies to sell policies through the iowa farm bureau that also totally disregard the affordable care act. how is iowa ignoring the federal statute? it simply declared that this insurance is not insurance. no, really.
cms has not responded to huffpost's request for information.
two florida democrats who have been in the spotlight lately for very different reasons are the winners of the bernie sanders $200-and-under award, receiving the largest share of their congressional campaign funds from people giving modest amounts of any current candidates so far this cycle.

between 61,000 and 183,000 low-income residents of michigan are likely to lose government-provided health insurance next year, thanks to new medicaid rules the state republican legislature passed last summer and that the newly elected democratic governor now wants those lawmakers to amend.
so far, those trade-offs haven't gotten much attention.
i feel kind of silly for everything that is going on, she said. we understood it wasn't technically insurance, but it worked the exact same way as insurance.
pratt was one of about 20 volunteers who got together for a meeting in idaho falls march 11 that transitioned into a celebration complete with guitar and banjo players. they gathered at a restored early 20th century house that tucker, its owner, converted into a children's art gallery to honor her daughter, cady, who died in 2002 at 11 years old in a car crash in neighboring montana.

last year, the center for medicare and medicaid services, or cms, announced it would let states alter existing obamacare rules known as 1332 waivers for the distribution and use of federal health insurance tax credits to allow people to purchase cheaper insurance plans that exclude key benefits, like full prescription coverage, maternity costs or inpatient psychiatric care.
bloody-facelift-gate: kushner threatened 'morning joe' hosts - [extremely annoying hamilton fan] well, actually, our leaders have been mired in salacious scandals since the foundi―-*is crushed by safe* gabriel sherman: according to three sources familiar with the private conversations, what happened was this: after the inauguration, morning joe's coverage of trump turned sharply negative. around this time, scarborough and brzezinski found out the enquirer was preparing a story about their affair. while scarborough and brzezinski's relationship had been gossiped about in media circles for some time, it was not yet public, and the tabloid was going to report that they had left their spouses to be together…. in mid-april, scarborough texted with trump son-in-law jared kushner about the pending enquirer story. kushner told scarborough that he would need to personally apologize to trump in exchange for getting enquirer owner david pecker to stop the story. (a spokesperson for kushner declined to comment). scarborough says he refused, and the enquirer published the story in print on june 5, headlined 'morning joe sleazy cheating scandal!' [nymag]
i really admire lindsey graham for his ability to start off being someone who wasn't crazy for trump but after getting to meet him ... he's on board and he's fired up, said albert spence, who works as a nurse in clemson.
kentucky is not going to suddenly turn blue any time soon, no matter the outcome of beshear and bevin's fight this week. but ahead of a 2020 cycle that will give them another chance to pick at the gop's sizable majorities in the legislature and flood the state with tens of millions of dollars from national democrats and progressives eager to oust senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, tuesday's election is a test of kentucky's vitals and whether the party inside the coffin that republicans thought they'd nailed shut has enough of a pulse to crack it open again.
in january, new york passed the reproductive health act, integrating roe v. wade into state law.
it is so critical for black voters to realize, first of all, their history, she said. we are black every day, we don't have to wait till february to know our history.
but democratic nominee state sen. barbara bollier, a former doctor who was a republican legislator in the state as recently as 2018, is proving to be a competitive challenger. bollier changed parties two years ago, citing moral objections to the gop, and because she wanted to help expand medicaid and fund education. she denounced the anti-transgender language added to the kansas gop's platform and was a vocal critic of the republican party leadership ― particularly former gov. sam brownback's aggressive tax-cutting agenda.
other candidates made misleading statements, too. sen. michael bennet (d-colo.), who also supports more incremental changes, said offering a limited version of the public option would lead to universal health care in this country in two years, not 10 years. but the kind of plan bennet has endorsed wouldn't get us universal coverage in two years ― or, really, ever.
biden also would improve the tax credit subsidies used by health insurance exchange customers. currently, there is no financial assistance available to exchange users who earn more than four times the federal poverty level, which amounts to $103,000 a year for a family of four. instead, tax credits would become available to anyone and cap their annual health insurance premiums at 8.5% of their income. the subsidies would be more generous, too, because biden would peg their value to the cost of a gold exchange policy instead of the less-comprehensive silver plans, which often carry deductibles in the thousands of dollars.
sometimes patients who are prepared to pay cash for uva treatment find they can't afford the charges. wayne williams, 43, of charlottesville, is a custodian at a community college. he was uninsured but feared he had strep throat last year.
biden has made it clear he prefers to bolster the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. biden would do that, in part, by offering more financial assistance to insurance buyers and by creating a voluntary government-run plan, what's known as a public option.
that vote inspired gross to run against sullivan. in lieu of the landmark law that expanded coverage to 20 million americans, sullivan offered no solution, gross said. dan has turned his back on the health care issue.
as for what a second trump term might bring, more of the same seems likely. last month, trump gave a speech on health care and signed executive orders for his america first healthcare plan, which isn't so much a plan as a collection of slogans and untruths.
there are still a number of republicans sitting on the fence, but once it's clear the bill would lose, more members may decide to vote no.
kasich and snyder aren't the only republican governors who run states that have expanded medicaid under the affordable care act. nor are they the only ones who have warned about the potential losses in coverage or budgetary holes that might come if the law is repealed. gop govs. charlie baker of massachusetts, asa hutchinson of arkansas and brian sandoval of nevada have offered similar concerns.
as hiv diagnosis rates continue an impressive fall in san francisco, likely thanks in part to an estimated 12,500 residents going on prep, the number of diagnoses among african americans has remained stable of late.

i can't give assurances on a specific hypothetical, he said, arguing that his declining to speak on the matter is consistent with how other nominees have discussed issues they may rule on.
it's simple: obamacare must go, he told supporters last year.
much of that is because attorney general william barr had laid the groundwork for trump, creating a narrative that the report had been overblown all along with the mantra of no collusion, no obstruction. but it's also because mueller himself has refused to tell lawmakers how to do their job.
washington ― it should be an easy vote.
now, in a reflection of this year's higher-than-usual democratic enthusiasm, public polling indicates that the race for arizona's 8th is competitive. tipirneni even leads lesko by 1 percentage point in an emerson college poll released monday, although political strategists still see her as an underdog.

goldstein, 36, is running for congress as an infectious disease doctor at massachusetts general hospital during a global pandemic. he wants single-payer health care, universal child care, a green new deal, and a monthly cash assistance program during the covid-19 pandemic. he has the endorsements of andrew yang, local sunrise movement chapters, the bernie sanders-aligned our revolution, and indivisible, one of the largest grassroots progressive organizations.
but in other parts of the country, and for certain groups of people, buying health insurance is going to look a lot like it was before the affordable care act. cheap insurance will be available, as long as you are healthy, and it will take care of you just fine, just as long as you stay that way.
more deals may be in the offing, jpmorgan analyst gary taylor said in a research note. given anthem and cigna's pursuit of humana in 2015, we think new potential combinations could emerge. he does not expect shares in either anthem or cigna to move given that investors had expected this ruling.
back at the field office in milwaukee, a crowd of around 100 had crammed into a small room to see harris, lining up to take selfies with her, and happily singing happy birthday. she didn't mention evers much — the two had just met — but she said baldwin had been talking up the gubernatorial candidate.
but in most respects the two bills are similar ― and on a similar political trajectory. the new version of jayapal's legislation included enhancements, including better coverage of long-term care for the elderly and disabled. it also had slightly less support than a previous version: about two dozen incumbent house democrats who signed onto a medicare for all bill in the last congress declined to co-sponsor jayapal's. but jayapal also secured support from new interest groups, including some of the unions that are now signing onto the sanders bill as well.
i don't think i want to vote for biden, she told huffpost.
currently, says grossman, there are 40-50 different laws that have been used in different states that apply to women who are thought to have induced their own abortions. some are technical, including things like illegal disposal of medical waste. others are fetus-cide laws, which include added penalties for criminals who harm pregnant women while committing another crime, but which paltrow fears can be turned against women themselves in the guise of protecting them.
but when challenged that the ahca would have undermined those protections and that the gop-backed lawsuit to strike down obamacare would gut them, he said that that implied those were the only two ways to address health care.
the buttigieg plan lacks one other key element of medicare for all. it does not envision the government dictating uniform prices to doctors, hospitals and other providers of care, nor does it envision setting an overall budget for total u.s. spending on medical care.
protections for people with pre-existing conditions, tax credits for lower- and middle-class insurance buyers, expanded state medicaid programs for the poor ― all of these things would be gone, and millions of people would lose health insurance if the administration gets its way.
the policy would roll out slowly. at a press conference unveiling the state's $209 billion budget on thursday, newsom said that leave would be paid for mainly with existing funds.
of course, o'connor is still just a district judge. becerra and the democratic state officials would appeal any adverse decision immediately, seeking a stay ― and they would probably get one, if not from o'connor, then from the u.s. circuit court of appeals, where they would once again stand a good chance of prevailing on the merits.
that prompted the appeal for an expedited hearing from the democratic lawyers who are defending the law because trump won't. they represent 20 states, the district of columbia and the u.s. house of representatives.
the devil's in the details. these are all things that sound good, but most of them don't get over the finish line for one reason or another. we have to study why that happens and make that work.
as an orthopedic surgeon, gross had a front-row seat to witness the health care problems in the state, which has the second-highest health care costs per person in the country. he regularly made more than $2.5 million a year working three or four days a week. gross told a columnist for alaska dispatch news in 2017 that a significant chunk of his income came from the outlandish fees that private insurers paid for tests and other services rather than his core work of operating on broken bones.
people thought that bowling green was a far more conservative place than it is, and i think we've proven that to be absolutely wrong, minter said. people are starting to see that the deck is stacked against them, and they want people who are going to stand up for them and show up for them. if we can mobilize that in bowling green, there are plenty of other places that could be mobilized.
that's quite a turnaround for a man who used to say stuff like this all the time:
this is the trump administration's end run around congress, sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms, told huffpost. the end result will be higher premiums and fewer plan choices for people with health care needs, as well as for healthy people who want the kind of benefits and financial protection that real insurance is supposed to provide.
in recent days, the 37-year-old galloway has based almost her entire campaign on support for medicaid expansion. she's held virtual events with the doctor who started the petition drive that led to tuesday's referendum, with the st. louis chapter of the naacp and with a state house candidate who lost his medicaid coverage during parson's administration.
if there's a 4-4 tie, with roberts joining the three remaining liberals but the other four conservatives voting to strike down the law, the 5th circuit ruling would stand. the law would be unconstitutional, but a district judge would have to decide which parts stay on the books ― after which, potentially, there could be another appeal to the 5th circuit and then maybe even back to the supreme court.
at this point, given the stark awfulness of donald j. trump (see 1, below), the entire republican caucus in each house of congress is a disgrace for not: (1) making an express, concerted public break with trump; (2) approaching the democrats to jointly launch an impeachment investigation for abuse of office; and, even, heaven forbid (3) working with the democrats to get things done that will actually help the american people, including by strengthening, not weakening, health care; creating jobs; and making genuine investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and education. unfortunately, so long as trump gives the congressional gop what its donors want — tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of corporations — mcconnell, ryan, et al. seem okay with allowing trump to act disgracefully. sad!
americans are pretty keen on the idea of creating a new government-run insurance program, or at least expanding an existing one, in order to make sure everybody can finally get affordable health care.
the goal of any lower-polling candidate is to have a moment, and o'rourke's declaration of support for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons ― hell, yes, we're going to take your ar-15, your ak-47, he told the moderators. we're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow americans anymore. ― qualified as one and is likely to be one of the few clips voters who didn't watch live will see from the debate. it's likely to generate attention not only because the party's base seems ready to embrace candidates adopting bolder positions on gun control but also because it's a risky position for a democrat to hold for the general election.
one bright spot in the face of possible impending abortion restrictions has been the improved access and shared experience of women using medication as an option to induce an abortion. approved over 16 years ago by the fda, mifepristone medication abortion is now commonly used up to 10 weeks after a woman's last period. research has shown that the experience of using medication to cause an abortion at home is safe, private, and effective and allows the woman to have more autonomy during the abortion experience. by teaching women how to use the abortion pill, women become less dependent on the traditional in-office medical procedure.
imagine, for example, a 30-year-old who today buys a minimalist policy directly from an insurer ― say, one of the bronze plans with relatively skimpy benefits that barely meet the affordable care act's coverage standards. because that plan covers so little and because 30-year-olds pay lower premiums than older people, that bronze plan is probably pretty cheap.
as he prepares to accept his party's presidential nomination for the second time this week from the grounds of the white house ― an unusual and legally questionable venue that highlights his failed handling of the coronavirus pandemic ― trump is asking the nation to reelect him in a far more broken and exposed condition than when he first took office.
but the obama administration wasn't simply out to ensure the newly reformed insurance markets could work. regulations on short-term plans were also meant to protect consumers.
sandoval is one of five gop governors ― including govs. charlie baker of massachusetts, rick snyder of michigan, john kasich of ohio and asa hutchinson of arkansas ― who set a letter to congress about the disastrous consequences of repealing a law without a replacement in place.
durbin said kavanaugh was adding to the requirements of texas law.
the fact that markets in health care don't work the same way as those for other products was recognized as early as 1963 by kenneth arrow, a leading economist at columbia university. he saw uncertainty as the root cause of market failure in health care--uncertainty among patients not knowing what they will need, uncertainty among physicians about diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, and uncertainty among insurers about risk of enrollees. (2)
in some states, cuts would happen automatically because the executive actions or laws authorizing expansion call for restoring the old, pre-expansion eligibility standards if the extra federal funds stop flowing. taking all of this into account, enrollment in medicaid would drop from 68.6 million to 53.2 million, by the urban institute's reckoning.
but it also was a convenient way to paper over some of the party's divides between progressives and moderates, many of which are more about policy details than they are about the general direction the party should head in. every democrat can agree to fight for affordable health care, even if some think that should mean a medicare for all system while others are hoping for a simple increase in subsidies to obamacare.
it's unclear what trump's bad dream team of lawyers thought of trump's latest confession; loose cannons themselves marc kasowitz (two weeks ago ranking: 8) and jay sekulow (last week's ranking: 8) may not have been phased, but presumably mercenary jared lobbyist jamie gorelick (two weeks ago ranking: 9), and actually appropriate criminal lawyer john dowd were shaking their heads.
bloomberg via getty images senator bernie sanders (i-vt.), center, speaks at a sept. 13, 2017, news conference on gop health care legislation on capitol hill as democrats call for single-payer proposals to be considered.
that prompted the new lawsuit, which comes from republican state officials across the country ― and which, in a highly unusual move, the trump administration now supports.
he has never had a successful strategy for bending congress to his will, said enjeti, who co-hosts the realignment, a podcast about making the gop a more working class-friendly party. he didn't care enough about policy.
what will we do with this moment? how will we be remembered?
we will take strong, decisive action to combat climate change, he added, papering over some of the more contentious policy debates democrats have been having over the last year.
but at the end of the day, holding the line on medical spending almost inevitably means taking money away from the health care industry. and that's never easy to do. as larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation put it, there is a bipartisan consensus that health care cost containment generally seems better in theory than in practice.
the bill would drastically reduce federal spending on health care programs for low- and middle-income people, so it's almost certain to result in millions of americans becoming uninsured.
with all of this going on at once, perhaps it's understandable that trump would confuse record business with absolutely no business at all in any way, shape or form. after all ― to borrow a phrase ― nobody knew health care could be so complicated.
this article has been updated throughout. jonathan cohn and s.v. date contributed reporting.
most striking of all, the republican party is divided. one day before the planned house vote, factions within the party are still arguing over fundamental questions ― and if those divisions don't stop the bill in the house, they are sure to cause major problems in the senate. sens. ted cruz (r-texas) and rand paul (r-ky.) can't stand the idea of leaving any of the obamacare edifice in place, while sens. bill cassidy (r-la.), susan collins (r-maine) and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) are saying they won't vote for anything with such significant coverage losses.
the senate contest won't turn solely on the outsourcing question. to win in red-tinted indiana, donnelly will need to prove his bipartisan bona fides on a host of issues, especially since he's taken a hard line against the gop tax cut and obamacare repeal plans. he's started with immigration. donnelly said he worked with a bipartisan group of senators that the president had tasked with finding an immigration compromise. he made news this week when he mentioned his willingness to support a border wall, but he's supported increased more border security before.
i'm sure many have strong feelings against this idea. so did the ancient athenians when the spartans ended their long occupation and their puppet tyrants fled. none of those who remained could see an easy path to loving their neighbors when half their neighbors had supported a murderous regime. and yet they did the only thing they could to move forward: they took an oath to forget the past and never bring it up again.
fox news reprised the crumbs comment no fewer than 43 times this week alone, according to a search using the media monitoring service tveyes. and in press releases, floor speeches and interviews, capitol hill republicans have been working to make crumbs as famous as pelosi's we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in it comment from the obamacare debate in 2010.
jen bendery sen. lisa murkowski shares her office with walter, a 63-pound salmon.
one is the cost. ministry officials estimate their members pay up to 30 percent less than people with traditional insurance coverage because there is no corporate overhead.
but recently accusations against trump have been circulating as conservatives feel he has walked both sides of several issues before. bush's ad accuses trump and clinton of conspiring to take down the gop.
and, crucially, the legislation is a vehicle for massive tax cuts for rich people and corporations, paid for by slashing assistance to poor and middle-class people.
trump made his disdain for mccain clear in the summer of 2015 ― shortly after announcing his presidential run ― by throwing out a belittling comment about the arizona senator's military record. he told a crowd gathered at an iowa political forum that mccain was not a war hero.
· millions of americans in the sandwich generation would find it impossible to save the hundreds of thousands of dollars they will need for their own retirement and health care along with the health care needs of their parents. combined with other pressures such as rising college tuition costs, working and middle class families will fall farther and farther behind.
republicans believe, rightly or wrongly, that work requirements are popular. whether they reconsider the medicaid changes could depend in part on whether they face political pressure ― say, from from advocates for the poor or the health care industry, and the governor as well.
the anti-welfare agenda notably targets immigrants, such as by trying to bar rent subsidies to families of undocumented immigrants, but any domestic program is potentially threatened.
but outside the white house and beyond his most ardent supporters on capitol hill, conservatives think that would be nuts ― either because they genuinely think the merits of the case are so weak or because they fear the political effects for republicans could be devastating, or both.
even though it's true, as trump said, that some people who can't get insurance from a job ― like the part-time workers at his company ― can't afford policies from an exchange or directly from an insurer, this statement still contradicts his assertion that all his employees are having tremendous problems with obamacare.
in a dissent that took exception to virtually every element of the majority's ruling, 5th circuit judge king portrayed the lawsuit, the lower court ruling and the appeals court's decision as absurd.
brian schubert stepped down wednesday as chief of staff for rep. neal dunn (r-fla.) after the house ethics committee announced a misconduct investigation of him and his former boss, rep. patrick meehan (r-pa.). meehan said in january he wouldn't seek re-election after admitting telling a decades-younger aide he was her soul mate.
sanders had reason to be livid. back in 2009, sanders had voted for the affordable care act, passing up opportunities to hold the legislation hostage as more conservative democrats had. in 2017, when president donald trump and republicans were pushing repeal legislation, sanders fought them as energetically and effectively as any member of the democratic caucus.
mcsally's likely victory on tuesday shows how establishment republicans can thrive in gop's trump era: play up popular base issues like border security, keep the president close and hope for a little luck.
barnes had overdosed before, but had never come so perilously close to death or let her family see her in that state. i didn't want them to find me like that, she told huffpost this summer, four years after the fact.
even within the middle class, some might pay more
the unpopularity of the policies was one thing. bevin's reaction to them was another. before teachers were home from the capital, bevin blamed them for hypothetical cases of child abuse. i guarantee you somewhere in kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them, he said. (he later apologized.)

trump isn't the sole reason pawlenty lost: republican primary electorates now routinely choose outsider businessmen over experienced politicians, and pawlenty's previous job ― lobbying for wall street for a salary that neared $3 million ― didn't exactly fit the populist moment in american politics.
the high premiums are the result of multiple causes, some related to the affordable care act's design and some related to the way hostile gop officials have treated it. but whatever the causes, it's left some middle- to upper-middle income people struggling to find decent insurance. we've got to have it for people who can't afford coverage now ― it covers people up to what they can afford, jim ridling, commissioner in alabama said.
one reason some democrats have misgivings is the public's decidedly mixed feelings about the kind of transformation sanders envisions. americans like the sound of medicare for all but, as polls have shown repeatedly, they get skittish when they realize it means giving up private insurance.
even when democrat andy beshear declared victory a few minutes after 10 p.m. — a result bevin hasn't formally accepted — brewer still wasn't sure it was real.
hopp and brase, however, rejected that notion.
just seeing her run i think it meant a lot to me, particularly as a black woman who has always been interested in politics, has always been interested in how this works, but never really seeing myself represented in that type of fashion, she said. even if you didn't 100% agree with her, it kind of gave you that push like you can do this one day. it might not be president; it might not be senate, but that leadership position that you've always wanted, that promotion that you've always wanted, you're worthy, you can do these types of things.
the american health care act, as republicans call it, actually consists of two separate, but complementary bills ― one for the energy and commerce committee, and one for ways and means. each committee plans to begin marking up the legislation on wednesday, which means they will review the text, contemplate amendments, and then vote.
the differences matter, but so do the similarities
although the governor says she is committed to partnering with the legislature, she first makes us aware of her intent to water down michigan's thoughtful medicaid work requirements via a press release, mike shirkey, republican leader in the state senate, said in a statement.
the press for an expedited ruling involves a lawsuit against former president barack obama's signature affordable care act filed by a coalition of republican attorneys general, and joined by the justice department, that seeks to invalidate the entire aca system. last month, the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, based in new orleans, dealt a major blow to the plan by ruling that the law's mandate that individuals buy health insurance was unconstitutional.
those sentiments go a long way toward explaining what seems, at first blush, to be the most confounding result of the election: the counties with the biggest covid-19 surges right now also gave trump some of his biggest support.
one of the things we are doing is requiring consumer protection notice on the plans, azar told reporters during a briefing on wednesday. in fact, it's a more robust notice than president obama's administration had on these very same plans to ensure the patient, the consumer, knows going in what they are getting and what they're not getting through the plan.
several vulnerable gop senators joined democrats in voting to advance the bill, including susan collins of maine, cory gardner of colorado, joni ernst of iowa, dan sullivan of alaska, and martha mcsally of arizona.
despite trump's frequent boasts that he has essentially repealed the aca, millions continue to get coverage because of it. still, insurers across the country have said they are seeking additional rate increases because of what trump and the republicans have done to weaken the law. and saturday's halt of risk adjustment payments could further obamacare's erosion.
we have done fantastic things in the state, with one of ― if not the ― most successful health care efforts in the united states, inslee said at tuesday press conference, just hours after de blasio's. but there is more to do.
that campaign includes the introduction of work requirements that reduce enrollment largely by making it more complicated to establish eligibility for the program. it also includes efforts to change medicaid's funding scheme so that the federal government would provide states with fixed, presumably smaller contributions toward the program's cost.
when the obama administration wrote the regulations to implement the affordable care act, it was careful to make sure ahps were subject to the same guidelines on benefits and pricing ― including protections for people with pre-existing conditions ― as other insurance plans serving individuals and small businesses.
the party of lincoln now breeds xenophobia and racism. its president falsely accuses blacks and latinos of electoral fraud, supports laws designed to suppress minority voting, separates nonwhite refugees from their children, shafts dreamers, and relentlessly stokes white nativism ― all to salvage himself and his party's craven candidates.
in the week of that last deadline, young people made up 37 percent of enrollees, up from 22 percent at the start of open enrollment.
a last-minute whip operation from freedom caucus hard-liners has raised new questions about the first vote on friday. the budget resolution, acting as a vehicle for an obamacare repeal, advanced out of the senate early thursday morning and is supposed to get a vote in the house on friday.
together, we can break decades of political stalemate. we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future. the decision is ours to make.
and the effects would not stop there. the health care law includes all kinds of other, lesser-known provisions, touching everything from the way medicare pays hospitals to the calorie counts on food menus.
markets do not lead to efficient outcomes, let alone outcome that comport with social justice. as a result, there is often good reason for government intervention to improve the efficiency of the market. just as the great depression should have made it evident that the market often does not work as well as its advocates claim, our recent roaring nineties should have made it self-evident that the pursuit of self-interest does not necessarily lead to overall economic efficiency. (4)
but, hey, at least work's going well.
a federal appeals court in new orleans partly upheld that decision last month and sent the case back to o'connor for further consideration. the law remains in place while the case continues to work its way through the courts. given the stakes, it's likely that the supreme court ultimately will have to make a final decision on the lawsuit.
(she ended up voting present on the final vote for an arcane procedural reason; the congressional record reflects her position was a no on the nomination.)
but grayson, a frequent guest on cable news shows, said the main reason he and sanders have gained the support of so many small donors is their exposure. it's the fact that people know me, people know sen. sanders, he maintained, citing his numerous tv gigs and sanders's many radio appearances. a lot of people feel sen. sanders and i are part of their lives, and that's meaningful to people.
the supreme court has already rejected two previous challenges to the affordable care act: the 2012 case and one that it heard in 2015. legal scholars are in wide agreement that this new case is significantly thinner than either one of those.
washington ― obamagate as campaign strategy or obamagate as distraction from the coronavirus may be missing a much simpler explanation: obamagate as big macs.

christian, jewish, muslim, hindu, and secular leaders gathered inside planned parenthood metro washington's new carol whitehill moses health center on tuesday to perform a blessing of the space.
compared to income disparities, racial wealth disparities are more severe and generationally established, and thus they have a much more intense and lasting impact that the tax law will exacerbate, the report said.
and this week, it was again trump's twitter feed generating chaos, as he started thursday morning by attacking a compromise to keep the government funded past a friday night deadline. this time, it was deputy press secretary raj shah who had to undo the damage, releasing a statement that trump does, in fact, support the spending bill.
pelosi seems to have avoided the sort of criticism conservatives would dish out to a republican speaker if they felt dissed because progressives generally believe pelosi is on their side. the speaker did clean up her comments a bit about the green new deal during her weekly press conference thursday, though she also managed a certain backhanded condescension in doing so, saying she welcomed the enthusiasm of the green new deal as well as the other proposals that are out there.
prior to running for president, trump railed against obamacare. he promised to repeal it on the campaign trail four years ago. he spent much of his first year and a half in office on a failed effort to repeal the law in congress. he joined the lawsuit awaiting a hearing at the supreme court.
it's death to democrats, moore crowed. they go after state and local taxes, which weakens public employee unions. they go after university endowments, and universities have become playpens of the left. and getting rid of the [individual] mandate is to eventually dismantle obamacare ― by sparking a death spiral for the law, he enthused.
now the event, like so much else, is canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. organizers said they may find a way to reschedule but, for now, celebration of the affordable care act will have to wait.
republicans have rejected those alternatives, in part because they would entail some combination of stronger regulation, more government spending, and higher taxes. their preference is to weaken or take away obamacare's protections, which is what repeal legislation and that court case would do. if insurance companies didn't have to cover as many services and didn't have to take on the sickest people, they could offer coverage for a lot less, republicans reason.
the so-called salt deduction tax increase angered even some republican and independent voters in richer parts of the country, and it was a key reason democrats were able to win many long-held gop seats in areas like new york and orange county, california. but it's less than the most important priority in a coronavirus response bill, though it could set up another partisan blame game if it's republicans who insist on stripping that provision.
if they choose to screw with them, they control all the branches of government and i think they'll be judged very harshly, slavitt said.
his campaign appeals to fear, not hope. his transcendent calculation is repellent; his apocalyptic and nihilistic conservatism exists solely to slake his craving for power. his coalition is evangelicals, gun fanatics, nativists, climate deniers and tea party atavists -- and even many of his ideological allies despise him. he is joseph mccarthy reborn, a man without conscience, willing to say anything. choosing between trump and cruz depends on whose personal and political pathology you fear most.
it's clear that the va has strengths in areas such as behavioral health care, spinal cord injury care and prosthetics. these will likely continue and grow the meet the changing needs of veterans.
we've always had health plans that had better networks than in most places, she said. when labor unions were really strong here, they insisted on good networks of providers. and they [insisted] upon reasonable prices too.
while it has over a dozen titles in its portfolio, the publishing company american media, inc., has been newsworthy recently for what weekly, the title with which american media was originally affiliated when the company was founded? (national enquirer)
paying full price to stay on his old employer-sponsored plan, through a law known as cobra, was far too expensive. i was in a panic, so my only other choice was to reach towards the aca to find something on the marketplace that was able to fit into our budget, daniels-lewis said. it saved me. i lose my breath every time i think about what would've happened if i wasn't able to reach for that lifeline.
it is a widespread myth, long a meme, among conservatives and many in the public that national health insurance would be government-run health care with rationing of services, as opposed to the free market offering more choice without rationing.
and they haven't given up, even though last year's effort failed. just this week, vice president mike pence reaffirmed the party's determination to take up repeal in 2019 if they still control congress. in the meantime, the trump administration has been using its executive authority to undermine pre-existing condition protections unilaterally ― most recently, by effectively creating a parallel market with plans that don't live up to the aca's standards.
the impact of the aca on finances ― and health
but already, democrats are facing criticism from progressives for focusing their health care subsidies through cobra, which would direct federal funds toward more expensive private insurance plans, rather than expanding public programs like medicare and medicaid, which pay health care providers much lower rates.
drew angerer via getty images health care came up when the democratic presidential candidates debated last month in miami, and it is sure to come up when they debate this week in detroit.
critics say the exemption is unfair to people who are not close followers of a christian faith.
one reason medicare for all will get a hard look is that the democratic party's increasingly powerful progressives are determined to improve upon the coverage gains made under affordable care act, which has helped many millions get health care but also left many millions still struggling to pay medical bills. a single government insurance plan, progressives say, would be more efficient and effective than obamacare's awkward mix of private and public plans.
the trump administration and its allies are not trying to stop this transformation. they're trying to speed it up, as part of their efforts to undermine the 2010 health care law. last month, the administration proposed a regulation that would make it easier for insurers to sell short-duration plans. this past week, gop lawmakers in florida passed a bill that would make it easier for residents to join ministries.
at the federal level, lawmakers could make tax credits more generous ― or take more comprehensive action, like having government set prices to control costs or provide insurance directly through some kind of public plan. a single-payer or medicare for all plan, which many democrats support, would do both of these things.
can she deliver on that promise? can sanders? can any backer of medicare for all?
it is code for doing less, said john holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the urban institute. it would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. holahan published a policy brief on wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.
we would act quickly, on a bipartisan basis, mcconnell said at a news conference on tuesday.
the negative consequences of this active refusal to offer help to vulnerable americans are obvious.
most working mothers do not have paid leave or workplace flexibility or health care; they are struggling to succeed. they don't need a well-off lady role model. they need policies that support their lives.
anger over that helped republicans win elections. two years ago, it gave them total control of the federal government and they got right to work on repealing the health care law, as they'd long promised to do. but then it turned out their plans would result in many millions of people losing health insurance and people with pre-existing conditions having fewer protections, even though trump and his allies had promised again and again not to do that.
but trump and mcconnell already have the scaring-old-people market covered. and in a crowded field of candidates seeking the votes of an increasingly progressive democratic electorate, it's not even clear the tactic will really help biden.
medicaid and the children's health insurance program
we knocked on so many doors, brewer said. we had people who'd been out for months knocking on doors. we sent text messages. we made phone calls to friends and family. we had days of action. i've never seen so much engagement from people who'd never done it before.
the benenson strategy group and the gs strategy group, which conducted the phone survey for aarp, polled a representative sample of 605 americans aged 50 or older who voted in the 2016 election. almost half of them were trump voters.

some alaska election watchers maintain that sullivan is more vulnerable than trump, because of perceptions that he lacks independence. while the sparse polling data available in the state shows an unusually close race between trump and biden in alaska, trump generally polls higher than sullivan.
if they really care so deeply about this issue, they could make the threat to preexisting conditions disappear in a snap.
for all the grief she's taken when she's defied her party, it would make sense if murkowski has at least considered leaving it and rebranding herself as an independent. it would make even more sense given the way her party treated her in 2010, when it initially appeared her re-election bid was derailed after she unexpectedly lost the gop primary to a tea party challenger.
the contradiction between the health care legislation republicans still want to pass and the claims republicans are making now seems to be more a rhetorical sleight of hand than a tactical retreat, but it's a different story with food stamps, where republicans continue to say they support expanded work requirements but seem prepared to compromise on the current farm bill.
jorjani also has been given broad power over public records requests. in december, zinke signed a controversial order that put jorjani in charge of the agency's freedom of information act program, stripping transparency authority from the agency's chief information officer. zinke pegged the change to exponential increases in requests and litigation and noted that records requests to the agency increased 30 percent between fiscal years 2016 and 2018. less than a month later, jorjani signed an order that appears aimed at making it harder for news organizations and the public to obtain government documents.
schachtner said she never expected to win. she figured that if she lost by 10 points, it would be considered a successful race.
we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee. in 1996, at age 30, matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. now, matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act. matthew, on behalf of all americans: welcome home.

in a year the gop is defending upward of 10 competitive senate seats, peters' seat in michigan and sen. doug jones' in alabama, are seen as republicans' only two opportunities to pick off democrats this year since they're in states trump won in 2016 — and republicans are going all in.

decades later, the law ended up empowering black voters. after their turnout lagged behind those of white voters in the general election, one of the largest turnout operations in history sent millions of black georgians to the polls on jan. 5, lifting both ossoff and warnock to victory.
editor's note: donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the u.s.
the story is the same within the u.s., where hospital prices vary enormously from region to region. it's not the hospitals with the best outcomes charging the highest prices, research has shown pretty consistently. it's the ones with the most market power ― in some cases, because they have monopolies and are basically able to demand what they want from private insurers.
in his ruling, judge bates didn't simply concur with the justice department's finding that an aetna-humana merger would reduce competition and harm consumers. he also said that aetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchanges for favorable treatment from [the justice department] regarding the proposed merger. after justice rejected the merger, bates said, aetna pulled insurance offerings from florida, georgia and missouri in part to follow through on the threat that it made earlier.

we've got to see ourselves as equal, and we're never seen as equal, hagwood said. [the tax law] shows you we're not equal.
these changes meant insurers had to charge a lot more than they did before, because now they were paying medical expenses for people with serious medical problems. the law's architects understood that would happen, and so they created a system of tax credits that discounted premiums, in some cases quite deeply.
ohio's overdose deaths spiked in 2017, rising by 41 percent between may 2016 and may 2017. drug overdoses claimed roughly 64,000 lives in the united states in 2016, with the vast majority related to opioids, helping to drive the average american life expectancy down in back-to-back years for the first time since the 1960s. with the crisis showing no signs of abating in 2017, experts predict it will be the third consecutive year of declining longevity, which hasn't happened in nearly a century, since the spanish flu pandemic in 1918.
noble's firm, oh predictive insights, conducted a poll last week showing mcsally leading in the gop race with 47 percent of the vote, compared to 27 percent for ward and just 13 percent for arpaio. most undecided voters were breaking to mcsally, and with many voters having already cast their ballots ― arizona allows early mail-in balloting ― it's difficult to see either opponent catching her.
the notion that the gop was hard at work on an amazing new health care plan was news to everyone in the gop when trump said it last week. what republicans and everyone else did know is that the justice department's march 25 announcement that it wants the courts to invalidate the entire affordable care act put republicans in a pickle. if they win in court, they lose in public, because people would be pretty upset.
the nursing mothers law was one of the few pieces of the affordable care act that both democrats and republicans could agree on. pro-life conservatives who otherwise denounced former president barack obama's 2010 landmark health care law joined their liberal colleagues in supporting the breastfeeding provisions. the thinking was simple: if a mother wants to breastfeed, she should still be able to work for a living.
but it is not like they were the only ones making such choices. among non-elderly adults, 14% with private insurance and 17.8% with medicaid said they, too, were declining to fill prescriptions because of cost.
the house submitted a filing last month to the appeals court in support of the law, as did a group of 17 mostly democratic-led states including california and new york.
the truth is that the health bill allows medicare, for the first time, to pay for doctors' appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues with their physicians, politifact wrote in 2009. these types of appointments are completely optional, and aarp supports the measure.
the court is scheduled to hear arguments later this year, but a decision might not come until 2021. the move threatens health care coverage for more than 20 million americans.
he also thanked his outgoing acting white house chief of staff, mick mulvaney, for serving the administration so well. mulvaney will be named the u.s. special envoy for northern ireland, the president added.
bill pugliano/getty images president donald trump is upset that members of the ultraconservative house freedom caucus objected to the gop's obamacare replacement bill. their opposition helped kill it.
even people paying more for their insurance had benefits, like a prohibition on annual or lifetime caps on payouts, that could save them from financial ruin if they were hit with a catastrophic illness or injury.
the bill also includes a clause that would allow insurers to continue offering grandfathered plans, which are exempt from the affordable care act's standards for benefits and pricing because insurers were selling them before the law took effect. it's not clear whether these plans would be available to people not already enrolled in them. if they are, that could undermine other regulations on insurance.
washington (reuters) - the u.s. supreme court on friday took up an appeal by president donald trump's administration seeking to enforce new federal rules allowing employers to obtain religious exemptions from an obamacare requirement that health insurance that they provide to employees pays for women's birth control.

but not everyone believes medicaid expansion is the answer to the problems facing rural hospitals. medicaid is as likely to prop up inefficient and wasteful hospitals as anything else, said michael cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian cato institute.
polling on the race shows that a key problem for ward and arpaio is that they have been left to squabble over the same parts of the gop base. early iterations of oh predictive insights' survey had ward leading mcsally, but her advantage disappeared after arpaio entered the contest. and arpaio's campaign now appears to be on a mission to sink ward's chances.
washington ― rep. rodney frelinghuysen, a 12-term republican from new jersey and chairman of the most sought-after committee in congress ― the appropriations committee ― announced monday that he would not run for re-election.
nearly 1.8 million mail-in ballots out of the 3 million requested have been returned in michigan as of this week. biden remains dominant in the state, emphasizing get-out-the-vote efforts targeted at michigan's black communities.
in case it's not self-evident, mcconnell's decision to avoid this kind of process has nothing to do with making good policy. however tedious hearings may seem, they offer a chance for outsiders ― the media, the experts and eventually, the public ― to learn about legislation and develop opinions about it.

i want to be clear: this isn't about me and amy, booker said. i accept the results of this election, and concede this race. but we will push in the coming days to ensure transparency and accountability in our state's electoral system, because it is essential that every single kentuckian has faith in our democracy as we go forward.
ocasio-cortez said she understood prioritizing fixes to the affordable care act. because we have a republican senate, a republican president, and so the things that we have the ability to pass right now are pretty narrow, she said, though she added she wanted hearings on medicare for all and didn't think single-payer solutions had been given enough attention from the democratic caucus yet.
we're going to work with our hospitals, trump replied. we're going to work with our doctors. we've got to do something. ... we'll work something out. that doesn't mean single-payer.
so why does a lifelong liberal like me not trust hillary's claim that she's a real progressive? here's my personal top 10 of hillary's most un-progressive moments:
the weakest claim may be the contention that striking down the whole law is necessary because the courts must respect congressional intent and congress in 2010 thought the whole law depended on the mandate to function. but in 2017, congress was fully aware that the rest of the affordable care act was remaining in place when it decided to zero out the penalty.
an undecided voter confronted president donald trump over his efforts to repeal the affordable care act during a town hall event on tuesday, asking how the white house planned to protect those with preexisting conditions while actively fighting to undermine protections already in place.
one exception was the justice department's refusal under obama to protect the defense of marriage act in court seven years ago. that case was about human rights; the current one is about health insurance regulations.
planned parenthood, less than 3 percent of the services they provide is abortion. and none of that 3 percent is funded by you, she added.
this is not a new concept. the appropriate role of government, as is so needed today to reform our health care system, was recognized more than 200 years ago by john adams, second president of the united states and one of our founding fathers:
as president barack obama approaches the end of his second term, there's been much discussion of what his legacy will be. while much of that debate focuses on his foreign policy or his sweeping domestic policies, such as the affordable care act, there's another area where the 44th president has left a significant mark: making life easier for millions of working parents.
raskin went on to say that on a huge bill like cares 2, rank-and-file members can only hope to have influence on one or two items, depending on whether they are on relevant committees or able to form groups or can make noise about an issue. and all of those things have just become more difficult during this time, he said.
medi-share is an example of the good that happens when the modern concept of the sharing economy is applied to the biblical ideal of sharing our resources to lift one another's burdens, gardner said. while people may inquire due to the program's availability and affordability, they join and stay because they become part of a community that is committed to and effective at sharing one another's burdens.
thousands of more americans have turned to the aca for health care coverage after losing their jobs amid the pandemic — and covid-19 cases are surging. across the nation, 38,115 new infections were reported by state health departments wednesday. the previous single-day record of 34,203 was set on april 25.

the deals democratic leaders made with industry and with their own members shaped the legislation in ways that affected its implementation. this was especially true for the newly regulated private insurance plans available to people buying their own coverage.
the proposed $100 billion investment would be substantially more than what previous proposals, such as price's, allocated. but even so, the investment would probably fall far short of providing coverage for all the people who need it. both liberal and conservative health experts have speculated that high-risk pools really need more like $150 billion to $250 billion over that time period.

honestly, i believe that if hiv rates are lowered in the white gay community, they will definitely lose interest in lowering rates in communities of color, says thomas davis, a health education specialist at the los angeles lgbt center who is african american. they've been leaving us out since the start of the epidemic and still do to this day unless they're called out for it.
the 20-year-old is almost the perfect personification of gen z, the politically engaged generation taking to the streets to protest against inaction on climate change, racial issues and climbing student loan debt.
for all the bluster about obamacare in congress and on the campaign trail -- plus the many, many repeal votes -- state-level republicans have had more opportunity to actually disrupt the affordable care act.
trump's rhetoric echoed his comments from the earliest days of his presidential campaign in 2015 when he visited places hit hard by the opioid crisis. despite his tough talk, trump has taken little action to address the epidemic as president, and it has showed no sign of slowing since he took office.
the senate failed again tuesday to pass the rider-laden version of the bill.
the republican medicaid plan isn't just an attack on health care — it's a systematic effort to weaken the role of government and undermine the economic security of all of america's families. we can't preserve and expand the middle class if people don't have affordable health care they can count on.

with the assertion of a pre-existing condition answered, the insurance company next tried to claim that the patient did not have continuous coverage. in fact, although his employment-related policy had terminated, having enrolled in graduate school at age 24, he had been able to seamlessly transition, without a gap, to the very same insurance policy with the same company under his parent's plan. of course, the insurance company claimed that it could not access their own two separate policies. instead, it tasked the patient with providing documentation. they then suggested the patient file an appeal to expedite the claim processing.
the effects would touch every kind of insurance
they are literally teeing this up as an issue for democrats for the next year and a half. they're not even making a laughable attempt to save the most popular parts of the affordable care act. sen. chris murphy (d-conn.)
federal funding to support the gateway program, a construction project to expand a rail line between newark, new jersey and new york city, will likely also be scrapped from the omnibus bill. president trump had previously threatened to veto the legislation if it included federal payments for the program.
trump may have been referring to another issue with bipartisan support: efforts to tackle rising prescription drug costs. cnbc reported tuesday that the trump administration is in early talks with house speaker nancy pelosi's (d-calif.) staff about legislation that would do so.
a: if people flock to the public option in higher-than-expected numbers, the program's cost would exceed projections ― although, as with medicare for all, public spending would largely displace private spending. the precise mix would depend on details we don't yet have.
leigh ann beach, 37, of palmyra, experienced how differently hospitals treat those who cannot pay after hurting her ankle in a bike accident.

for california's immigrant communities, today's budget deal is bittersweet, cynthia buiza, executive director of the california immigrant policy center, said in a statement. although she praised the new coverage for young adults, buiza added that the exclusion of undocumented elders from the same health care their u.s. citizen neighbors are eligible for means beloved community members will suffer and die from treatable conditions.

it's more building on the affordable care act than replacing it.
after the fines were repealed, republican lawmakers in congress explained their votes as an attempt to correct the law's most unpopular provision, not bring down the entire law.
these farm bureau policies will be permitted to reject people with pre-existing conditions or at least charge them higher premiums. they won't have to follow federal law governing what benefits must be covered. and insurers will once again be allowed to set hard-dollar limits on how much they'll cover in a year or over a patient's lifetime. all of that is illegal under the affordable care act.
both republicans and democrats working on the presidential campaign agree that, for as many years as biden has spent in national politics and public life, the public still does not know much about his biography. so the convention spent a lot of time trying to fill in the gaps ― telling the story of the tragedies that have struck biden's life over the years, and how they've shaped his worldview.
if that happens, one of the people directly responsible would be hawley ― yes, the same senate candidate who keeps talking about his son's pre-existing condition ― because he's one of the 20 state officials behind the lawsuit.
this story has been updated with comment from sen. harry reid (d-nev.).
democrats are reluctant to be too excited publicly about polls showing joe biden leading trump, remembering the heartbreak of 2016 and knowing that the pandemic significantly complicates forecasting this election. but they have their eyes on seats their party hasn't won in more than 50 years, and in states that trump won by more than 20 percentage points.
in 2008, the top candidates all supported what's now considered the moderate position, which was some form of government-run public option as an alternative to private insurance. centrist democrats in congress killed that part of the affordable care act, and obama went along with it. this year, the public option is the bare minimum.
gop senators facing tough re-election fights in 2020 said they support popular elements of the affordable care act even as they continue to maintain that the law should be repealed ― a delicate rhetorical balancing act that failed to save many gop members of congress in the 2018 midterm election.
with so many flaws, it's difficult to imagine the case winning over five justices who have already rejected more legally plausible challenges to the affordable care act. then again, it was difficult to imagine these arguments prevailing in the lower courts. somehow they have.
tuesday's primary was marked by lower turnout than initially expected because of the coronavirus outbreak that election officials said likely scared voters from going to the polls. in the last week, newman's campaign was forced to cancel its planned door-knocking and typical get-out-the-vote operation. instead, the campaign focused on its phone-bank operation ing and social media efforts to get people to take advantage of early voting.
these voters aren't sure how to feel about the republican bill, however. a plurality of the older trump voters ― 41 percent ― said that they somewhat support the american health care act, and 33 percent said they do not know what to think.

several factors will cause taxes to increase for low-wage earners, said thomas barthold, chief of staff at the jct. for instance, using a lower inflation-rate index to annually adjust the standard deduction and a tax credit for the poor will increase taxes for low- and middle-income individuals. those with higher incomes will also be affected by the lower inflation-rate index.
i voted for bill but i'm not a fan of either of the clintons, he wrote.
things are likely to get worse, thanks to what republicans in washington have done since trump took over. they have passed a tax cut that effectively eliminates the individual mandate penalty. they have slashed funding for enrollment outreach. now, with this latest regulatory change, they have made it easier for people to purchase ― and then hold onto ― short-term plans that don't comply with the aca's standards.
ultimately, as koppelman warned, a lot depends on whether barrett sees the affordable care act in the same harsh light as judges who have ruled against it before. this latest case is even clearer evidence than the others that there is no legal doctrine that is too crazy to be accepted by republican judges if it'll stick a pin in obamacare.
annie clark, a spokeswoman for collins, told huffpost that while the senator talked extensively with trump throughout the process of choosing a nominee, she never gave [the white house] a list and never committed to supporting anyone.

constituents at a veterans' town hall for sen. joni ernst (r-iowa) angrily drowned her out on tuesday when she couldn't say what gop lawmakers plan to do once they fulfill their promise to repeal the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
whatever happens with the case, its very existence is a reminder that trump, who supports the lawsuit, remains committed to rolling back the affordable care act any way he can. and it is quite a contrast to the democratic presidential candidates, each of whom opposes those efforts.
simply by delivering his nomination acceptance speech later that night, the democratic presidential nominee pushed back against the trump campaign's argument. by delivering the speech well, he demolished it.
yet biden, a 76-year-old white man with more than four decades of political experience, is an atypical heir to obama's legacy, particularly in a democratic field with a historic number of minority candidates, as well as contenders who represent the kind of generational change obama ushered in more than a decade ago.
iowa has turned into an unexpected battleground this election cycle. trump won the hawkeye state by 9.6 percentage points in 2016 but currently leads democratic presidential nominee joe biden among likely voters by only 3 points, according to a new york times/siena college poll published last week. ernst trails greenfield by 2 points, 40% to 42%, according to the same poll.
the hill reported that cassidy also said:
it's something in the water in the community that's become cultural: 'my arm isn't falling off, so i shouldn't go to the doctor,' michael says.
i can't answer that question. it's up to people, he said.
some people prefer not to buy insurance, and by next year they won't have to choose between going without coverage and paying a penalty.
as progressive new york times writer david leonhardt notes, the comey hearing has relieved some of the pressure republicans faced in previous months against their health care plans. but it shouldn't, he says.
sudok1 via getty images every single one of us needs to stand up in support of improving and expanding our health care infrastructure, not repealing it.
now the people know they can vote. they may not be able to vote in this campaign right here, but there's one coming up in november and we can get many more registered for the next election. donna bookhart, 51
the best presidency ever – just ask trump
we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley, whose son, navy seaman craig wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole.
if they lose on this vote, i'm giving them an alternative, paul said. the alternative is two bills: clean repeal, and a big government spending bill that they can work with democrats on for big government-spending republicans.
president donald trump's campaign speeches are a merciless moral x-ray, of himself and of his party. to beat back democrats, he is waging an explicit race war rooted in blatant lies. illegal immigrants are voting in droves. democrats are funding a caravan of hispanic refugees, awash in gang members and middle eastern terrorists, to overrun our borders. as he replicates the rhetoric of history's most vile authoritarians, republican officeholders grab his soiled coattails.
she added: i am not here on a mission to destroy the affordable care act. 
yet congressional republicans are in increasing disarray about when and how to take on the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, so there's reason to doubt the president-elect's assertion that congress could act on his unseen health care proposals the same day, or even the same hour, that he sends them to capitol hill.
this bill, almost certain not to be the final legislation that will become law, is an opening offer from democrats. on past coronavirus relief bills, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) negotiated in private with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) and treasury secretary steve mnuchin.
without any enforcement mechanism to speak of, questions about the legality of the individual 'mandate' are purely academic, and people can purchase insurance ― or not ― as they please. no more need be said; it has long been settled that the federal courts deal in cases and controversies, not academic curiosities, king wrote.
again, there hasn't been an actual ideological shift among republicans. gop lawmakers still want to repeal obamacare, just as most want to build a border wall and impose stricter requirements on food stamp recipients. but they understand that espousing these policies so close to an election might harm their re-election efforts.
this is part of bevin's problem, voss said. he does not approach politics with the conservative style that has historically been the norm around here.
had the gop bill become law, states could have requested special waivers from regulations so that insurers could charge higher premiums to people who had pre-existing conditions and had lapses of insurance as short as two months. the waivers would also have allowed insurers to sell policies that didn't pay for mental health treatment, maternity care, prescriptions and other services that the affordable care act declares essential.
i didn't want to explain to my grandchildren that i didn't fight to stop trump, he wrote. maybe they will see that i stood up for decency, rule of law and equality.
rep. justin amash (r-mich.), one of the freedom caucus' staunchest members, responded defiantly to trump, tweeting that it didn't take long for the swamp to drain trump.
hawley would have missourians believe there is nothing contradictory in his rhetoric and action ― he simply wants to get rid of obamacare, not the law's promise of insurance for anybody regardless of pre-existing conditions.
most americans have the same core values. the election ought to be about competence and connection, not tribalism. there's no need to name or attack opponents. we just need to prove that we get it. viewers will connect the dots and trump's hold will break.
the first is that the affordable care act is a misnomer ― in other words, it doesn't really provide affordable care ― because the newly insured on medicaid can't find doctors who will see them, and the ones with private coverage are stuck with high out-of-pocket costs that make even modest medical treatment prohibitively expensive.
pretty much every respectable expert who has commented upon the case, including a few who helped craft previous challenges to the health care law, have said this new lawsuit lacks merit. but the judge is a conservative whom george w. bush put on the court, and in oral arguments he hinted at sympathy for the plaintiffs' argument.
with my vote, i will tell my children and their children that i did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me, he added.
democrats, at least, certainly think so, and are looking at both fresh polling data and history for evidence that the gop's repeal and replace effort will also repeal republican control of congress.
his stunt double would be don mcgahn, president donald trump's outgoing white house counsel. mcgahn has played a key role in helping cement trump's judicial legacy, leading white house efforts for the nominations of both kavanaugh and justice neil gorsuch, as well as scores of other lower-court judges.
conservatives have in the past objected to anything that allows the law's taxes and spending to last a few years, even if they are set for expiration later. another sore spot is the provision of refundable tax credits, meaning they are available to people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes.
they must pay full premiums, which in some parts of the country can consume one-fifth of their income, before taking into account potential out-of-pocket costs. president barack obama famously promised people who liked their old insurance that they could keep it. they couldn't.
although much of the focus in the early days of the crisis was on how the virus affects the lungs, patients can also experience blood clotting that leads to strokes, as well as various neurological complications, from headaches to seizures.
several other republican senators said they were not sure they would attend, and majority leader mitch mcconnell did not reply when asked by a reporter.
collins has also complained about vulgar phone calls to her office from people opposed to kavanaugh, the least popular supreme court nominee in decades, who, in opinion polls, is doing slightly worse or even with the ill-fated harriet miers and robert bork. (of course, for a definition of vulgar, collins really should just look up donald trump.)
thank you. god bless you, god bless america, and good night!
it is impossible to forget the horrible events of that day, and the pain and grief and mourning that our country felt, said sen. john cornyn (r-texas), the no. 2 republican in the senate.
at that time, religious employers including the little sisters opposed the government rules. this time, following changes made by the trump administration, they supported them.
claiming to be the victim of a political hit job, carson often accused the press of scrutinizing him more than his fellow candidates. his disdain for the mainstream media helped garner him more support from the conservative base.
medicaid expansion initiatives are on the ballot in three deeply conservative states: idaho, nebraska and utah.
however, while berners display a lot of passion that can cross over into anger, what i often see from all levels of the hillary side -- including hillary, her campaign, her surrogates, and her supporters -- is what i would describe as dismissive condescension. in fact, dismissive condescension is the cornerstone of hillary's argument against bernie, and it has been from the very start.
however, the california senator failed to land another clean blow on biden. she also seemed to struggle under fire from several other candidates, leading to a much more uneven performance than the fiery one she delivered in miami, which had given her a polling bump.
that's an unusual view of how the public might react to the collapse of the health insurance system during a time when the republican party controls the entire federal government and most state capitals.
a cornyn spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
they were asking the kinds of questions that you wouldn't ask if you weren't already persuaded by the plaintiff's arguments. nicholas bagley, professor at the university of michigan law school
it also describes one republican: sen. lisa murkowski of alaska.
other progressives have shown pelosi similar deference, despite the obvious mocking tone she used to describe the resolution.
that's doubtful. romney's win-at-any-cost approach has marked his entire career, and it is surely the fire behind his attacks on trump.
the offerings on the marketplace reflect this confidence. nine different insurers plan to sell coverage in michigan next year, according to the henry j. kaiser family foundation. and in most parts of the state, inexpensive policies remain easy to find.
funding for the initiative, which the budget authorizes for three years at a cost of about $1.5 billion, will come primarily from penalties that people without insurance will pay. this is basically a return of the individual mandate that president donald trump and congressional republicans zeroed out as part of the 2017 tax cut legislation.
he construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power, barrett wrote. had he treated the payment as the statute did ― as a penalty ― he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond congress's commerce power.
one possibility is that insurers will start to offer short-term plans with benefits that, though still not up to affordable care act requirements, are generous enough to attract a larger market share. insurers could also find ways of keeping healthy customers but shedding unhealthy ones, even while promising renewability.
in almost every state with a competitive senate race, the democratic candidate or an outside group controlled by allies of senate minority leader chuck schumer is airing an ad on pre-existing conditions.
trump, though, went far beyond anyone else, and would call obama and his policies stupid and claimed that obama was incompetent.
mark wilson via getty images sen. marco rubio (r-fl.) demonstrated in 2014 that it's possible to weaken the affordable care act without repealing it when he led a successful crusade to kill the program's risk corridor programs. insurers took big losses as a result; industry officials later cited those losses as a big reason some carriers abandoned the market.
as principal deputy solicitor, jorjani proved himself a loyal gatekeeper of the former secretary. as huffpost reported last may, he took six months to respond to investigators probing zinke's apparent effort to bully sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) into supporting obamacare repeal last year, only to dodge their questions entirely. and in a march 2017 email to colleagues, jorjani boasted that he had successfully protected interior presidential appointments facing investigations and that their primary responsibility was to do the same for zinke.
the appeals court is expected to hold oral arguments in july. meanwhile, the effects of the lower court ruling have been on hold pending appeals.
on tuesday, trump summoned chaffetz to the white house for a meeting. chaffetz said he had no idea why trump wanted to see him, but chaffetz later reported that trump made it clear he didn't want to talk about oversight.
in an interview with the washington post in early 2017, when tax reform talk was heating up in congress, camp rejected the idea that his 2014 bill, numbered h.r. 1 just as the 2017 legislation was, should have been necessarily relied on.
we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
exactly how far government should go, and whether innovation might suffer, remains a subject of debate among experts. but some of the democrats' ideas have attracted bipartisan interest.
at a time when candidates like biden are talking about leaving private insurance system largely in place and creating a public option for people who want it, the system harris envisions is a bit like the opposite: creating a government-run insurance system but creating a private option for people who want it.
as for walsh, he is an expert on severability, which is the legal doctrine about when a court must strike down an entire law, or large parts of it, because it has found one piece to be unconstitutional. justice clarence thomas just cited one of walsh's briefs in a recent supreme court decision on the subject.
facing that reality, many republicans seem willing to compromise on the stricter work requirements in the farm bill, under the belief that they can get them at a later date in another piece of legislation. either way, they don't seem to want to get into it so close to the midterms.
later in the debate, pence called obamacare a disaster. unlike the obama administration's response to swine flu, the affordable care act was often genuinely unpopular in its early years ― in 2014, 53% disapproved, according to kaiser family foundation polling.
and that was the message from every progressive huffpost spoke to on wednesday. democrat after democrat said defending the aca was the first priority, even as liberals argue that obamacare is ultimately insufficient in providing coverage for everyone and containing costs.
what we all want is to get something done. and i think we want to move the ball forward. we don't just want to do press conferences. i mean, we want to achieve things. rep. jim mcgovern (d-mass.)
the draft of the senate health care reform bill, called the better care reconciliation act, released thursday prompted new anxiety over what the eventual bill could mean for those living with mental illness.
moore's nomination to the fed, then, will be proof that conservative donors don't have to keep bothering with the charade of independent expertise any more. if a hack like stephen moore can land a job at the fed, why keep funding all these think tanks and policy shops?
trump campaigned on grandiose promises of terrific health care. people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything, he said on 60 minutes in september 2015.
politically, the strategy worked as intended. most of the health care industry supported the bill, or at least didn't fight it. but it meant that their prices wouldn't be coming down much, keeping insurance prices high.
one of the biggest challenges in this market is that individuals aren't staying enrolled for 12 months, said marti lolli, senior vice president for commercial markets at priority health. a lot of people are staying enrolled just for three or four months.
10. rex tillerson, secretary of state. last week's ranking: ―
the proposal was blasted by those who fear millions more would be left without health insurance coverage, facing illness and possibly even death while d.c. politicians dithered.
asked at the tuesday press briefing about morning tweets by trump that called cnn, nbc, cbs, abc, the washington post, and the new york times all fake news! sanders played to trump and his base, attacking the media for covering the trump-russia hoax and claiming that the president is subjected to a constant barrage of fake news. like trump, sanders raised the incident where three cnn staffers resigned following the retraction of a story about trump official anthony scaramucci.
but even before sen. john mccain made the thumbs-down gesture that still has president donald trump so worked up, republicans were finding ways other than national legislation to undermine the affordable care act.
rand corporation the rand corporation's analysis of changes in health care payments, by income group, under the proposed new york health act.
medicare covers a little less than 90 percent of actual hospital costs, according to industry data. and although some experts question the figure's accuracy or significance, few doubt that forcing hospitals to take medicare payments for all patients would reduce their revenue ― even after allowing for the savings hospitals would likely realize from streamlined billing, fewer charity care obligations, and other changes that medicare for all would bring.
there are a number of reasons supporters like this setup.
the effort didn't fail by much. a key senate bill fell just one vote short when sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) issued a dramatic, unexpected thumbs down on the floor. but by then the measure was already deeply unpopular and it was no surprise why.
we think that cbo simply has it wrong. health and human services secretary tom price
in the neighboring 8th district, game developer brianna wu is seeking to beat rep. stephen lynch by championing her experience in cybersecurity and technology amid mounting concerns about cybersecurity threats from foreign countries. she was one of the women in the video game industry who was targeted in the harassment campaign known as gamergate.
democrats insist it is not normal to have foreign interference in a presidential election, that trump's financial conflicts of interest are unprecedented, and that robust oversight is necessary when you have a president who seems intent on doing whatever he wants. they openly wonder how is it that the oversight committee has no current plans to investigate trump.
nevada voters will not be giving dean heller that same benefit of the doubt they are offering to trump, as they still see him as part of the problem in washington, lambe said.
that same lawsuit was an issue during the 2018 congressional elections. combined with the congressional repeal effort the prior year, these things gave democrats concrete examples of the gop's hostility to health coverage programs and to rules protecting people with pre-existing conditions. the republicans' electoral strategy was to respond to these obviously true things by simply lying about them and claiming their preferred policies would have the opposite effect.
what's more — south carolinians appear to be listening. a fox news poll last month placed the billionaire right behind biden in the state, showing that the steyer campaign's big media push seems to be grabbing some attention.
as a result, insurers across the country are raising prices and, in some highly publicized cases, pulling out of markets altogether. in phoenix, premiums are rising by 145 percent. a 40-year-old non-smoker ineligible for subsidies there will pay $507 a month, one of the highest rates in the country.
i don't know where said leaders are or when they might arrive, but i'd make one suggestion in their absence: that we unite in pushing for a general amnesty in the interim.
medicaid expansion, willmann said. that is one of the key things we could do to help us deal with the tough financial demands we face.
the senate finance committee hasn't scheduled price's confirmation hearing, but he is expected to appear before the health, education, labor and pensions committee next wednesday.
so when trump was looking for senate democrats from states he carried to potentially cross the aisle and back the tax bill, he wasn't looking toward baldwin.
he continued: it is not more tests. it is more spread of the virus. ... the numbers you're seeing are just a tip of the iceberg of even more spread.
for democrats' long shot bid against graham to succeed, they'll need more than just deep pockets. registered republicans outnumber registered democrats in the state by about 200,000, meaning that democrats need to either expand their pool of voters or cut into the gop's base to flip the senate seat. they're trying to do both.
there's an incredible amount of uncertainty over the legislation, which hasn't technically even been written, and there's a fair amount of bad faith. senate republican leaders kept their members, senate democrats, and the public in the dark about their plan to vote on a smaller version of repeal for weeks. there's little reason to believe majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) isn't working on alternative legislation now in case the skinny repeal runs into trouble ― or, conversely, if he sensed that a bigger deal were within reach.
sometimes you have to do things that you have to do for your country, but as far as socialized medicine, no, yoho said. does this fall into that? yeah, i guess you could throw it in there, but hopefully it's not the long-term.
let's not talk about the wall
it allowed me to breathe a little bit more and it didn't make me worry as much, he said. some of the anxiety disappeared, which is important when you have a chronic health condition. that alone, to me, was a lifesaver, even though it wasn't great.
after several successive relief packages that have failed to prevent a long-term recession from taking hold even as businesses begin to reopen, trump has still shown little interest in securing an additional bill that would, among other things, provide emergency aid to ailing state governments. he has delegated negotiations to treasury secretary steve mnuchin and has been more eager to lambaste states and cities run by democrats than use his bully pulpit to encourage a bipartisan deal that could be one of his last chances at a second term.
the party formerly indignant at the supposed depredations of the clinton foundation now countenances a blatantly profiteering president who conceals his tax returns while his properties attract favor-seeking foreign governments in defiance of the emoluments clause; a self-serving daughter and son-in-law leveraging their undeserved positions for commercial gain; and a cabinet awash in petty corruption and potential criminality.
but to compare the two parties at this time in our history is to indulge in false equivalency. for rationalizing the gop's pathology by responding with a partisan tit-for-tat is not adequate to the circumstances. the sins you perceive in democrats are the usual ones -- misguided policies, ill chosen means for dubious ends, and the normal complement of rhetorical dishonesty and political squalor. however mistaken you may find clinton and sanders on the issues, their debate is addressed to the world as it exists and therefore open to a sensible critique. the squalor to which the gop has sunk, an alternate reality rooted in anger and mendacity, transcends mere differences in policy, threatening the country with profound, perhaps irreparable, damage.
new mexico joined 17 other states and the district of columbia in implementing same-day registration for voting. starting in 2021, new mexicans will now be required to show an id at their polling location in exchange for a provisional ballot on election day.
trump renewed his pledge last month to jettison obamacare even amid the covid-19 crisis and despite warnings from aides about angering voters.
he's gone through so much with so many family members, he definitely believes it's a moral imperative, the official said, noting that biden has extensive personal experience with medical crises and the u.s. health care system. but he's also somebody who doesn't like to over-promise. he doesn't want to say chicken-in-every-pot on health care because he doesn't think he can deliver that and he thinks that's not the way to go about this issue.
what was unpopular is that we didn't get it done, and that's one person in the united states senate, rep. tom cole (r-okla.) said, referring to the late sen. john mccain (r-ariz.).
macarthur repeatedly declined to give a yes or no answer in two separate exchanges on whether the gop health care bill classifies rape as a pre-existing condition.
on his first day in office, trump issued an executive order instructing the federal agencies responsible for the affordable care act to find ways around it. this didn't have much impact in and of itself, but it set the stage for much of what's come after.
i told the speaker ― and i said in caucus yesterday ― we are completely united, as i've said for a while, on shoring up the aca. like, that cannot wait, jayapal said.
while connolly said he isn't holding his breath for any new information, democrats partly have themselves to blame for trump evading the ramifications of what's already been released. democratic leadership quickly developed the talking point that members needed to see the underlying evidence in the report and hear from mueller before making a judgment about impeachment.
the speaker can't convincingly argue to mcconnell or the administration that legislation is insufficient when it's garnering massive majorities from both parties. ultimately, the fact that the house would pass almost any response bill by a huge margin makes it more difficult for pelosi to demand progressive priorities.
biden's strategy will test whether anyone other than obama can recreate the coalition that delivered him to the white house twice, but was something hillary clinton was unable to do in 2016. and it will thrust the 44th president's legacy into the center of the 2020 campaign.
two-thirds of countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development guarantee six months of paid time off to new mothers. newsom's plan doesn't go that far. instead, the proposal, unveiled as part of his 2019 budget, would allow two caretakers to split six months off, according to a fact sheet provided by his office. one parent could take three months, and the other parent or partner or another family member could take three more months, or vice versa.
though reid is no longer in office to work on such reforms, pelosi is. she has said she thinks medicare for all is not realistic, but she has endorsed making the insurance subsidies more generous, as california just did for its own residents.
trump knows that, too. it's why he keeps insisting he wouldn't take that coverage and those protections away ― and, presumably, why he kept interrupting biden. but the record is clear.
with our present multi-payer financing system, there is little opportunity to achieve sizable discounts through bulk purchasing. bulk purchasing of drugs was specifically prohibited by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003, while the 2010 affordable care act continued to ban the government from negotiating drug prices.
next year is key for michigan as well; every state legislative seat and every single statewide office is up for election.
similarly, it's easy to dismiss vermont sen. bernie sanders' calls for a political revolution as mere rhetoric, a way to make his supporters feel a part of something bigger than themselves. and you can brush aside massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren's support for eliminating the electoral college and the filibuster as simply pandering to the party's left wing with never-gonna-happen calls to change arcane parliamentary rules and alter the constitution.
i think the likelihood of roe v. wade being overturned is very minimal. i don't see that happening, ernst said monday while facing off against democrat theresa greenfield in a debate hosted by iowa pbs.
but virginia will be interesting to watch. if populist-progressive tom perriello can channel the new grassroots energy into his candidacy, there's every reason to believe he can knock off the establishment candidate, ralph northam, who is lieutenant governor and was gov. terry mcauliffe's (d) hand-picked successor. if perriello can get past northam in the june primary, he'll likely face gop lobbyist and operative ed gillespie, who is perfectly ill-suited for the moment ― particularly with trump regularly attacking federal workers, who make up a significant chunk of the virginia electorate. democratic committee meetings in virginia, perriello told huffpost, are absolutely bursting out of the room in the hallways with crowds.
there were an estimated 27.5 million americans last year without health insurance, or about 8.5% of the population. that's up from 7.9% (25.6 million people) in 2017, according to census data. that was the first hike in the number of uninsured americans in more than a decade, the journal found.
president donald trump's recent promise of an executive order on health care makes no sense as policy.
the court is set to hear a lawsuit ― viewed as frivolous by all but the most conservative legal experts ― on the constitutionality of the affordable care act not long after the election. trump's justice department has supported the lawsuit, which would kill the law that helped reduce the number of uninsured americans to record lows.
it was an amazing night for working people in the commonwealth. it wasn't just teachers, brewer said. a lot of people want to make this a referendum on trump, a referendum on impeachment, a referendum on mcconnell. for us, this was a moment to slam the brakes on a really bad governor.
touting minor accomplishments that you played a negligible role in
she then traveled to a diner in suburban chandler, where she discussed regulatory rollbacks and immigration with a group of small business owners and local politicians, who shared their frustrations with sinema. the chat, which rarely drifted away from economic concerns, offered a hint of the chamber of commerce-style republican mcsally may run as in the general election.
perhaps the most surprising broadside against o'connor's ruling appeared in another conservative outlet, the new york post editorial page. in an op-ed, michael cannon, a libertarian health care expert at the cato institute, wrote that texas v. azar has so many problems, o'connor should have immediately tossed the case out of court.
but mcgrath seems to have tapped into the same thirst for new political faces that has pushed newcomers ― especially women ― to victories in democratic primaries across the country this year.
patient voices are also being sought in the evaluation of drugs for conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, high cholesterol, or psoriasis. many of these drugs are advertised constantly on tv with little helpful information for patients about which of the side effects is most prevalent or serious, how effective the drug is or how much it costs. icer provides this information. seventy percent of icer's funding comes from nonprofit foundations (70%) with the remaining coming from life science companies and health insurance companies. icer is dedicated to improving patient care by providing independent, completely transparent evaluations of how new drugs compare to existing treatments. icer differs from the fda by looking at the cost of treatments as well as their effectiveness in two ways - in comparison to no treatment (as the fda does) and in comparison to existing treatments (as the fda does not do). this is helpful for patients making their decisions when their insurance does not cover the drug or when deductibles or coinsurance may be very high.
it was the second editorial the journal published trashing the case. the first came in december, days after the u.s. district court decision and just weeks after house republicans lost their majority in an election where health care was a dominant issue.
the situation is more complicated for adults, especially those who do not have disabilities or minor children living at home.
sotomayor went on to explain to roberts -- and anyone else who needed to hear it -- how exactly the exchanges work.
thursday morning trump attained a historical low level of petty disgustingness for a u.s. president, with his tweets stating that he refused to meet at mar-a-lago over new year's eve with cable tv hosts and increasingly vocal trump critics joe scarborough and mika brzezinski and that the latter was bleeding badly from a face-lift.
it is time to shut the goddamn news outlets off because the truth is they are part of the problem as well. every few seconds the next frantic breaking news story appears that is not news at all.
any mention of policy tuesday night was only in vague terms.
opinions on the trump regulations and how to treat them tend to correlate with party identification, although the relationship isn't perfect and the differences among officials aren't just about partisanship anyway. they reflect some real philosophical divides over how health insurance should work and what role government should play in managing it.
for the first time in an election cycle since obamacare's passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. democrats now have a sizable advantage over the gop on the issue, and candidates frequently bring up their support for obamacare while meeting with voters.
the trump administration's department of justice reversed itself on monday, saying it agrees with a federal judge in texas that the entire aca, not just one part of the law as it had previously contended, should be struck down. the result of such a ruling would take coverage away from tens of millions of people and completely disrupt the health care system.
democratic officials representing 20 states and the district of columbia, along with the u.s. house, are defending the law. they dispute the idea that the mandate is now a coercive, unconstitutional command.
i wasn't sure why i bothered, i rarely looked at the account. when it came to finding a meaningful relationship, the recent move to st. petersburg, florida, had been worse than moving to new york city was 10 years earlier. but i didn't make the change in my profile to winnow potential partners so much as to announce how sickened i was by the president-elect.
under a trump administration here is how i see it.
special agent hernandez, please stand: we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement ― and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice.
if we can maintain 30 percent of this energy, that's a huge increase in our local democratic capacity, he added, arguing that republican house seats that were 9-point wins in the past could soon become competitive.
kaiser actually tested to see how some of those arguments would affect public opinion and, sure enough, people were even more excited about medicare for all when they heard, among other things, that it would eliminate premiums, copays and deductibles.
that is is a big reason the law caused so much anger and why most democrats are now proposing further reforms, whether it's as modest as offering more financial assistance or as ambitious as creating a large new government-run insurance program. the preferred gop solution is simply to roll back the insurance regulations that made coverage so much more expensive.
as house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) said thursday, there are different ways of getting at work incentives, and i'll just leave it at that.
the lawsuit, texas v. united states, comes from republican officials in 20 states and alleges that the 2010 health care law is unconstitutional. last week, the justice department declined to defend the law, breaking from the customary role the federal government plays when states challenge a federal statute.
king said he is just unsure of who that is right now. he is leaning toward casting his vote for sanders because of his promises to help various groups of disempowered people and to attack the student loan debt crisis, but he's still undecided. he let out a sigh of exhaustion thinking about how he's going to decide. though he understands why some people decide not to vote, he says that's not an option for him.
as larry levitt, executive vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, told huffpost, a medicare for all plan absolutely can be designed to fulfill the promise that the middle class would on average pay less for health care. but it requires some big trade-offs to do that.
on thursday, davis pressed harris on her criminal justice record, listing positions that have changed over the years. and davis pointedly read biden one of his quotes from 1975, in which he said he didn't believe society had any responsibility to address the legacy of slavery.
congressional republicans have fiercely opposed expanding medicaid even as a number of gop-controlled states have done so under obamacare. they've called the move costly and unsustainable to the safety net program's fiscal health in the long run. but they haven't yet offered a plan that would provide health insurance coverage to a similar number of people as done by obamacare.
none of this, of course, is certain, underscoring why progressives must double down their energy. with voter suppression, possible russian electorial interference and the usual gop arsenal of dirty tricks, republicans may be able to cling to power in both chambers. gerrymandering has helped to rig the system, too.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) moved to protect gop senators from schumer's gambit on wednesday by setting up a competing vote on a bill offered by tillis that they say would maintain coverage for preexisting conditions in case the supreme court strikes down obamacare. that bill, however, would not provide coverage of essential benefits and other protections found under the aca.
mcconnell's grand strategy of blanket obstruction under president barack obama couldn't stop obama's re-election and ultimately ended with an earthquake in the republican party. president donald trump was elected on a platform opposed to free trade and tough on banks, obliterating the republican economic message of the past 40 years.
midterm elections are just 10 months away, and the party faces the very real possibility of losing control of the house because of trump's unpopularity. state elections in new jersey and in virginia in november showed big energy among democratic voters. a special state senate election in wisconsin this week in a solid gop district was won by a democrat.
the combined effort makes it appear as if vulnerable republicans senators are trying to convince voters barrett won't push for unpopular conservative policy goals, including the repeal of abortion rights and the elimination of medicaid expansion, if she gains a seat on the nation's highest court.
a complex chain of events would likely follow. the number of people buying insurance on their own would drop from 19.4 million to 12.6 million, according to projections that the urban institute published this week.
default reinsurance: the bill also includes a default establishment of federal reinsurance programs in states that choose not to implement such a program with state innovation grants. many conservatives had significant concerns with reinsurance payments to insurance companies under obamacare.
the hurdles to pumping at work took a financial, emotional and physical toll on many of the women. huffpost identified five cases in which workers developed mastitis, a painful inflammation that can come with swelling, a burning sensation, fever and chills. mastitis can result from skipping pumping sessions and milk backing up in the breast. in one example, a worker at a pancake house developed an infection but worried she would lose her job if she spoke up ― a fear common in many of the cases.
but if the administration really does wait on the outcome of litigation, and it drags on for weeks or months or even years, then the impact on insurers expecting to get those payments could be considerable.
a group affiliated with sanders' our revolution ran a slate of eight people to be delegates to the june state party convention, and all eight won, said jordan weinstein, one of the eight. several are also moving to become members of the town democratic party committee in arlington. weinstein said he's running for a seat on the town council, known as the arlington town meeting. the ages range from 30s to 60s, he said.
progressive groups, buoyed by the failure last week of republican efforts to repeal obamacare, are hoping to gin up support for a democratic filibuster against gorsuch.
the new law's corporate tax cut is permanent, while the individual tax cuts aren't ― which means that the majority of americans would actually end up paying more, although republicans have made clear their hopes that lawmakers will eventually make those cuts permanent, as well.
why is scott pruitt so determined to lead the effort to destroy america's environment and the world's climate? i suppose because it's a niche that has provided him with big donations from the fossil industries, fueling his rise from tulsa lawyer and minor league baseball owner to state senator to oklahoma attorney general to epa head, and perhaps next to the u.s. senate seat up in 2020 and currently occupied by 82-year-old james inhofe (r-ok). from there, maybe oil, gas, and coal money could propel pruitt into the white house.
a doctor who wants to fix u.s. health care
because, again, this is so much bigger than who is president of the united states. because this is so much bigger than the democratic party or the republican party. this is so much bigger than trump ever getting impeached and us winding up with the equally problematic mike pence. this is about the very soul of america, which way forward will we choose, or do we remain stuck, or do we continue to drift backward?
but with the threat of full repeal receding, at least for the moment, democrats are starting to think about what comes next. and increasingly they are thinking about public insurance as a supplement or substitute for private insurance.
this was especially true in 2016, on the eve of the last presidential election, following a series of reports about rising premiums and insurers withdrawing from markets because of big financial losses. although it's difficult to know what role health care played in the vote's outcome, promises of repeal figured prominently into trumps' campaign rhetoric.
it's not just about coverage, it's about access to care, it's about access to be able to see your doctors, cohn said in an interview on fox news sunday. the numbers of who's covered and who is not covered ― that's interesting, and i know that may make some headlines, but what we care about is people's ability to get health care and people's ability to go see their doctor.
people's physical distance reveals their marginality when legislation is coming through someone else's committee, this democrat said.
he estimated that another 15,000 people in the u.s. will die from covid-19 in the next month.
putting those two numbers together would mean the number of people without comprehensive coverage ― in other words, the type that meets the affordable care act's standards ― will rise by nearly 9 million, according to the urban study.
and he's right. digging into the details, he continued:
and other democrats suggested that sanders would represent a sort of tipping point because he could accomplish much of his agenda through executive orders.
for the republican base, nothing changed.
although many democrats in congress aren't ready to support medicare for all, most seem to favor at least some expansion of government-run insurance programs. and even the most conservative members of the party's caucus agree on the need to defend the affordable care act's gains against president donald trump, who recently announced his support for a lawsuit that would wipe the law off the books because of one allegedly unconstitutional provision.
sometimes republicans defending themselves on health care tout their support for high-risk pools, which are special health programs for people whom insurers had denied coverage. but the pools, which many states operated in the past, are a notoriously weak substitute, with higher premiums, fewer comprehensive benefits and limited coverage of pre-existing conditions. they also never seem to get the funding they need, which limited enrollment and created waiting lists in some states.
we're planning to [step up outreach], in part because organizations are popping up all over the place, she said. we're kind of looking at it and going, 'wait a minute! we're here! you don't need to invent the wheel!'
any of the leaders could have made it easy. they could have put the bill on their respective chambers' floors the way they expedite so many other bills, the way mcconnell put two anti-obamacare votes on the senate calendar on thursday.
we've had a lot of members who've made statements and are very committed to having a solution in place for pre-existing conditions. there are just a lot of ideas about how to do it, thune said.
many of these ministries are small, but there are three large organizations.
polling in the montana house race has been sparse, but the available figures suggest quist has gained ground against gianforte.
you're not going to convince me that there's a single person who's a better negotiator than nancy pelosi, khanna said.
trump allies viewed mcsally skeptically, citing her loss to sinema in 2018 as evidence of her weakness as a candidate. even the president appeared to grow impatient with her in the waning days of the race, denying her a chance to speak at a rally in her state. at another campaign stop, trump gave her only a minute to address his supporters.
when democrats do find themselves in the position of a legislative majority, they are still expected to pursue republican policies. (obamacare was based on the health care reforms of massachusetts gov. mitt romney; dodd-frank's wall street restrictions arose from a regulatory scheme devised by george w. bush's treasury secretary hank paulson.) truly liberal ideas aren't supposed to be taken seriously. it is this misplaced obsession with washington appearances ― rather than rigorous policy detail ― that explains why sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) lectured schoolchildren about the supposed implausibility of a green new deal.
nothing. never. nobody, manchin's spokesman jonathan kott told the huffington post.
of importance to most americans: the bill, called the health and economic recovery omnibus emergency solutions, or heroes, act, includes a second wave of $1,200 payments to the vast majority of u.s. households — this time with even more inclusive eligibility rules than the previous payments. benefits would go to immigrants and would be protected from garnishment by banks and other debt collectors.
if there is less coverage as people get older, people ... are less likely to leave a job to care for a family member or pursue their own business, she added.
while the house has been in play for democrats for months, their chances only grow by the day to take control of the chamber, as new polls show further momentum. but control of the senate, seen as a long shot just weeks ago, is also now a realistic, less-daunting possibility. mcconnell even told reporters this week, i hope when the smoke clears, we'll still have a majority.
the proposal, which ricardo alonso-zaldivar of the associated press first reported wednesday evening, also calls for automatically enrolling the uninsured, among others, in this new program ― in the hopes of finally achieving universal coverage.
another way the buttigieg plan would improve upon the affordable care act would be by making those marketplace plans, including the new public option, available to anybody. this could make a big difference to workers, especially low-income workers, whose company plans have high premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both.
force and highly critical of international trade agreements which have resulted in job loss and disinvestment domestically. sanders has also been completely transparent and released all of the transcripts of his paid speeches to wall street firms (zero). the clinton campaign has yet to formulate an adequate strategy for addressing these issues to the satisfaction of sanders and his base.
that is one reason gop duplicity matters. it is about what party members will do in the future, and not simply what they've done in the past.

tears are flowing heavily on capitol hill and the campaign trail as republicans try to distance themselves from a pending supreme court lawsuit that would kill the affordable care act and its guarantee that health insurance companies provide coverage to anyone regardless of medical history, and without extra charges for preexisting conditions.
trump spent most of 2017 trying to pass legislation that would repeal obamacare, as the aca is known. when that failed, his administration focused on using its regulatory authority to undermine the law.
q: would a public option be easier for wary americans to accept?
the most brutal part of the night for harris, however, came at the hands of rep. tulsi gabbard. the congresswoman from hawaii blasted harris over her record as attorney general of california, criticizing her for maintaining the cash bail system that, she argued, disproportionately hurt poor people.
so you'd think the gop-friendly nfib would be champing at the bit to roll out an association health plan for its members. nope!
unlike doma, the question here is not a question of major constitutional significance that produced deep divisions, yale law professor abbe gluck said thursday evening. there is no great moral question for [the justice department] to engage here.
on a per-person basis, this is way more than health care costs in any other country. closing that gap was a major focus of the affordable care act, which ratcheted down what medicare pays hospitals and introduced incentives for higher quality, but less costly, care. it was part of a broader effort to push the health care system in the direction of more efficiency, in the hopes that more efficient care would also be less expensive.
donna bookhart, 51, also a sanders fan, said parnell reminds me of a bernie sanders, but laid-back.
a second holocaust survivor who is here tonight, joshua kaufman, was a prisoner at dachau concentration camp. he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks. to me, joshua recalls, the american soldiers were proof that god exists, and they came down from the sky.
we have a strong background presumption of severability, which reflects a long-standing understanding of how congress works and our respect for congress' legislative role, kavanaugh said.
there is a new opportunity in american politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. victory is not winning for our party. victory is winning for our country.
democrats were determined to avoid past mistakes and decided ― for better or worse ― that the best way to do that was to minimize disruption of existing insurance arrangements, borrow conservative ideas in order to win over some republicans, make peace with potentially hostile interest groups, and avoid a huge price tag that they believed would scare the public.
associated press planned parenthood has left the federal title x program because of new restrictions on discussing abortion with patients, implemented by president donald trump's administration.
revolution: sanders promises a political revolution that begins with the american public and then goes to washington, bringing intense pressure to bear on politicians to adopt progressive priorities.
president donald trump has repeatedly tried to take away obamacare's guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions. most recently, he ordered the justice department to support a lawsuit advanced by republican governors seeking to strike down the law in its entirety ― including its coverage guarantees for patients with preexisting health conditions and health insurance for millions of americans.

it's not like i overwhelm the health care system, put it that way, lucas said.
the trump administration also carried out some consumer-friendly reforms, such as permitting pharmacists to tell patients when there's a cheaper drug available and requiring hospitals to publish the prices they charge for procedures. the administration also established a widely praised new system to care for medicare enrollees with end-stage renal disease.
the underlying premise of texas vs. azar is that the affordable care act's individual mandate, which imposed a financial penalty on people who didn't obtain insurance, has become unconstitutional because the 2017 tax cut reduced the penalty to zero. because congress in 2010 thought the mandate was an essential piece of the affordable care act, the lawsuit says, the courts must throw out the entire law.
the republican senator from maine, who positions herself as a pro-abortion rights moderate, signaled early support of brett kavanaugh, president donald trump's supreme court nominee. according to a huffpost source, collins allegedly green lit trump's nominee before the president even chose kavanaugh, though she strenuously denies this. the senator now faces activists who have so far raised $1.3 million and counting via crowdfunding for any opponent to run against her in 2020.
this has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment by any objective standard, mcconnell said at his year-end news conference, specifically mentioning judges he had confirmed and the tax cuts – but not mentioning trump by name during his six-minute opening statement. i think we've made a difference for the country in beginning to move it right of center, which was the opportunity presented to us by the american people.
as supreme court justices hear oral arguments on tuesday and consider how to rule, these six americans will be watching and worrying.
the other candidates have been less specific, yet they have not gotten the level of scrutiny that warren's plan famously has.

we are looking for 435 highly motivated self-starters who work well individually and in a team environment.
when the senate understands what's happening, and when they hear from their supporters, they will be way more engaged around this, mcgill johnson said. susan collins and lisa murkowski are both on record opposing the gag rule, so we will continue to reach out to them and their offices to garner support. but this impacts every senator's home state.
both ward, 49, and arpaio, 86, have made tougher immigration enforcement the centerpiece of their campaigns. arpaio kicked off his statewide tour at the phoenix office of immigration and customs enforcement, while ward is campaigning with fellow arizona rep. paul gosar (r) and right-wing media personalities mike cernovich and tomi lahren.
nobody in the administration was more helpful in trying to move this through the process once the president was moving forward. pete rouse, former white house senior advisor

he said younger people are currently driving the spike in cases across the sun belt, where states have been reopening large parts of their economies. more than 90% of the country remains susceptible to the virus, redfield said.
trump may ultimately conclude that this is the one path forward. but if that time ever comes, he will be starting at square one, having not bothered to bring in any democratic voices into health care discussions during the first critical weeks and months.

on tuesday, grassley insisted that the millions of people who gained insurance under the affordable care act won't lose their coverage if the law is repealed.
a large, ideologically broad chorus of legal experts have said the latest case lacks merit. and the aspect of the lawsuit that has drawn the most criticism is the same one that attracted so much scrutiny on tuesday: the issue of severability.
booker, who became kentucky's youngest black state lawmaker elected in nearly a century in 2018, ran on a slate of progressive proposals that included the green new deal and medicare for all. he broke into the national conversation amid the protests, receiving numerous endorsements from state lawmakers and national progressive leaders ― including sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and ayanna pressley (d-mass.). kentucky's two largest newspapers also endorsed booker in the contest's closing stages.
republicans did run ads on obamacare in the pennsylvania special election, going after democrat conor lamb for supporting the health care law. and republican rick saccone supported repeal. but ultimately, it didn't work. lamb won in a district where the republican incumbent (who resigned over a sexual misconduct scandal) had run unopposed in the previous two cycles. trump won there by 20 percentage points as well.
he's days into his presidency, chaffetz told huffpost. i laid out an oversight plan that will lead to lots of investigations.
to put it another way, whether or not the supreme court decides to make a statement about the constitutionality of the now-meaningless mandate, it should let the rest of the affordable care act stay in place. even lawyers who supported previous challenges are saying as much.
this attack utilizes classic republican mediscare tactics designed to foment discontent among older americans that anyone else's gains come at their expense.

people are starting to realize that the anti-establishment thing is kind of a luxury we can't afford right now, bannon told the new york times last week ― a stunning admission, and a sign that bannon, like trump, may be very scared of what could happen if democrats get ahold of committees and begin investigations. (bannon certainly hasn't given up on demolishing the establishment in europe, having recently been instrumental in helping to bring an anti-immigrant, anti-european union government to italy.)
the 15-page memo, annotated by ailes personally in black marker and unearthed from the nixon library archives by journalist john cook, states that people prefer watching television because the thinking is done for you and that the white house should be able to get pro-administration stories out to local stations directly, without working through the networks. it avoids the censorship, the priorities and the prejudices of network news selectors and disseminators.
but some people clearly believe the supreme court might invalidate obamacare — namely, the plaintiffs seeking to overturn it: 18 republican state attorneys general and the trump administration. if they didn't think it's at least possible that the court would agree with them, why would they litigate over the law at all?
if gross succeeds, he could swing the senate for democrats and chart a new path for moderate politicians trying to win in rural, red states. a victory would also attest to the enduring political price republicans like sullivan have suffered for voting to repeal the affordable care act.
president donald trump can't stop talking about democratic presidential candidate joe biden in an attack ad that the former vice president's 2020 campaign released this week.
the new rules affect so-called short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which typically cover far fewer services than comprehensive policies and aren't available to people who have pre-existing conditions. the plans, which because of obama-era restrictions are currently available for only three months at a time, have historically served as a stopgap for people who have temporary lapses in coverage ― say, because they are between jobs.
sen. susan collins of maine, who is facing a tough reelection fight next year, was the only republican who voted with democrats in support of the measure.
we are a nation that, on the one hand, both encourages and preaches about the importance of being good parents to your children, says ellen bravo of family values @ work, an advocacy group that pushes for paid sick and family leave. and yet for millions americans, doing exactly that will cost them their financial security.
however, the senate's plan may still propose giving states the power to waive what's known as essential health benefits. this would allow insurance companies in those areas to exclude certain benefits from their coverage, like mental health or substance use disorder services.
that isn't as much of a fringe belief as you might think, he wrote. pizzagate wasn't a one-off. it was the tip of the iceberg.
rising premiums left her uninsured when she fell off a bike and hurt her ankle last year. her husband works in construction to provide for their family with seven children. a rainy 2018 washed out working days and his income. they couldn't afford their $667 monthly insurance premium.
but medi-share doesn't operate in the way that an employer plan would. after reviewing her records, it determined the tumor was actually a pre-existing condition ― because, medi-share explained in a letter, danielle had mentioned the bump to her family doctor once before, roughly three years earlier. that made it ineligible for treatment under the ministry's guidelines.
pfeifer came with his wheelchair. others toted oxygen tanks to aid their damaged lungs. jon stewart came twice, bringing cameras and a spotlight. eventually, the bill passed on the last day of the legislative year, attached to a massive government funding bill.
booker argued, again, to release some of the committee confidential records that are being withheld from the public.
and not only that, there's been asymmetric polarization, so if you're trying to reach a compromise with them and they're continuing to move to the right, then compromise continues to move to the right as well.
as a result, parnell's fortunes hinge largely on the enthusiasm gap. assuming a below-average percentage of republicans will vote, parnell has a solid chance if he can convince enough democrats energized by trump, health care and other concerns to show up at the polls, robertson suggested.
yet another hazard for buyers is the ambiguity over pre-existing conditions. when insurers see a big claim, they will frequently scour medical records for evidence of pre-existing conditions, sometimes denying payment for people who thought they had applied for coverage ― and given their histories ― in good faith.
he's shown very little interest around serious policy discussion about health care. julius krein, founder of american affairs magazine
while those tax credits offer generous subsidies to people at the low end of that income scale, people at the higher end get little help and those who earn more than four times the poverty level get no assistance at all. affordability has been an issue for those latter two categories of consumers since exchange coverage became available in 2014, and premiums have risen substantially since then.
lynch, however, doesn't seem to be taking the challenge too seriously. he told the boston globe that his campaign is just doing my job day-to-day.
democrats are bullish on health care as an electoral issue after focusing on president donald trump's agenda during the midterm elections last year, during which the party won control of the u.s. house and made gains in state legislatures and governors' offices around the country. in addition, voters in idaho, nebraska and utah ― three reliably republican states ― approved ballot initiatives to expand coverage for low-income residents through medicaid.
bevin, by the way, wanted to disrupt obamacare in kentucky despite its extraordinary success.
fletcher's tumultuous time as governor and the elder beshear's eight years in power — he won a second term in 2011 — helped democrats hold on to their majority in the statehouse and earn some massive victories, including beshear's decision to make kentucky the only state which former president barack obama lost twice that fully implemented the affordable care act. but it also kept them from realizing that the party's infrastructure had begun to atrophy and that the registration advantage democrats had enjoyed since the new deal era had become a mirage.
but typically economists at least pretend to care about things other than, say, raw partisan advantage. when congress was considering trump's tax cuts in late 2017, moore ― who never saw a tax cut he didn't like ― was enthusiastic. but the reasons he gave to bloomberg's sahil kapur didn't have much to do with economic performance.
photo gallery scenes from democratic debate no. 2
but set aside the party's disingenuousness with respect to the economic and fiscal concerns that, in many cases, have gained it your allegiance. in other important areas the party has abandoned serious thought. instead, the alternate reality of the gop has created a closed intellectual system immune to fact or reason, imposing a mindless political fundamentalism on its candidates which no reflective person, least of all you, can any longer support.
new york also passed an equal pay bill, covering all protected classes.
the future of the u.s. health care system will depend a great deal on whether president donald trump wins reelection or former vice president joe biden defeats him, and the contrasts between trump's record and biden's aspirations make the stakes plain.
would we want these people not to be getting insurance? of course not. they're the people who need it the most. donald berwick, former administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services
and it would completely erase the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions, subjecting them once again to an insurance market that doesn't want them.
why the difference in tax credits matters so much
according to a survey conducted by boise state university in december, 71 percent of idahoans support closing the so-called medicaid gap, with just 22 percent opposing.
they are shutting down outreach efforts that are effectively free, peck said. one of the most effective things we do in the final days is to email people, just to let them know the date of the deadline. that's all bought and paid for already. taxpayers will not save a single cent by not sending emails in those final days. i can't fathom what claim of efficiency can be involved there.
not getting embroiled in a sex scandal
politicians deceive voters all the time, of course. but for republicans to mischaracterize their whole approach to such a defining issue ― to pretend that they are trying to help people get health care when they have spent more than eight years promoting policies that would take it away ― is something else entirely.
watch ryan on fox news above.
new york wouldn't be the first municipality to carry out a plan seeking universal coverage. san francisco enacted a similar plan in 2007, while newsom was mayor, and one of that plan's architects now is a de blasio adviser. los angeles county, california, and the district of columbia also have local programs that provide coverage and services to uninsured residents that predate the affordable care act.
this isn't the first time a classmate of cruz has made news. in 2013, cruz's freshman year roommate at princeton university spoke out about his decidedly negative experience with the future politician.
a: here's where things get really complicated. under these public option plans, the government wouldn't force employers to drop coverage. but some employers might decide to do it anyway, figuring the public option offers workers an alternative.
this availability of data coincides with our greater understanding of behavior. for instance, we know that fund managers tend to invest more in companies that are based near them, or where they are connected to employees via their old school tie.
retroactive eligibility ― a key if underappreciated provision of medicaid in most states ― doesn't simply help low-income people avoid crippling medical debt. it also helps finance the operation of safety net hospitals. ending it, as kentucky plans to do, would likely hurt both. when another state, indiana, experimented with having medicaid recipients contribute toward the cost of their medicaid, large numbers did not, and they ended up losing coverage as a result.
the airline added that passengers will be notified of full flights and can change flights at no additional cost.
oh, we'd fill it, mcconnell told a kentucky questioner who asked about the plan for a possible supreme court vacancy. (cnn noted the senator took a long sip of what appeared to be iced tea before answering the question with a smile.)
but as gross' own history reveals, alaska's politics are as quirky as its rugged terrain. gross' father, avrum, a jewish lawyer born in new york city, served as alaska's democratic attorney general from 1974 to 1980.
trump also vowed in a tweet to always always always!!!! protect people with preexisting conditions — which would be tough if they're no longer insured.
the logic of the case is so far-fetched that even conservative lawyers who brought previous challenges to obamacare think the courts should reject it. the case is basically a laughing stock within the legal provision, or it would be if not for the fact that reed o'connor, a federal district judge in texas, agreed with it and ruled, last year, in favor of the plaintiffs. that prompted an appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, which is the court that ruled on wednesday.

but that figure understates the damage a decision against the affordable care act would have on many other americans.
it is highly unusual for the [department of justice] not to defend duly enacted laws, which the affordable care act certainly was. this decision to even go more broadly in failing to defend the law is very disappointing, collins said.
the information came to light on monday, when senior u.s. district judge john bates upheld a decision by the justice department to block the aetna-humana merger ― a decision that aetna has said it may appeal. (the company did not respond to requests for comment.)
to medicare for all supporters, these compromise plans are inadequate because they retain too much of the status quo, in which even americans who have health insurance struggle to pay for medical expenses.
i think running for the benefits of tax reform is where i'm going to focus my attention on speaking about why ... we should be the party in power and in control, and what that means for the american people, sen. tim scott (r-s.c.) said tuesday when asked about health care in the midterms.
there are signs republicans are concerned about the downsides of following through with obamacare repeal, however.
not a great look - tara palmeri: when president george w. bush took office, he quickly and quietly disbanded president bill clinton's office for women's initiatives and outreach — and now president donald trump appears to be doing the same thing to president barack obama's white house council on women and girls. the council, created by obama in 2009 to monitor the impact of policy changes and liaise with women's groups has been defunct while the trump administration evaluates whether to keep it, according to three senior white house officials…. since ivanka trump joined her father's administration, she's been the most visible proponent for women's issues…. she was also credited with inspiring a world bank women's entrepreneurship fund [editor's note: clinton global initiative clone], to which saudi arabia and the united arab emirates announced a $100 million starter donation while ivanka trump was there in may as part of the president's formal delegation. but white house veterans say that's no replacement for having a dedicated office with staff. [politico]
we had our largest attendance ever at our regular monthly meeting last week, he said. we are averaging 4-5 signups per week on our website and are having events like new member breakfasts in an attempt to capture the momentum and find a place for these new folks to help out.
that hardly guarantees the ruling will hold up on appeal. but together with wednesday's ruling, it suggests that trump's attempts to undermine the 2010 health care law are pushing the boundaries of what's constitutionally and legally permissible ― and quite possibly exceeding them.
one reason the expansion has made such a difference is that it has dramatically changed the finances for organizations and programs that serve low-income patients, including those with substance abuse problems. the medicaid expansion is meant to allow higher funding to continue indefinitely, giving the providers of care ― and the state and local authorities that fund them ― confidence to make long-term investments in new facilities and personnel.
the other significance of thursday's action is not legal. it's political.
gaffigan wrote about the responsibility he feels to his children as well as to future generations.
there are any number of factors that change a statewide race that's decided by 5,000 votes, and any number of groups that may have made the difference: beshear and his campaign, a revitalized kentucky democratic party, the democratic national committee and democratic governors association — both of which poured late money into the race while leaving the particulars to locals who knew where it needed to be spent best — and the activists on the ground.

judge barrett represents a threat to the very rights - including reproductive rights, rights of lgbt individuals, and voting rights - that justice ginsburg worked so hard to protect, senate judiciary committee senior democrat dianne feinstein said on the senate floor on sunday.
sen. angus king (i-maine) zeroed in on jorjani's comment about how inspectors general love travel investigations because they're easy to spin.
repeal and delay is an act of cowardice on the part of the republicans, pelosi said earlier this week. where are they going to get the votes to replace? if, in fact, ideologically they're opposed to a public role and any participation in the good health of the american people, where are they going to get the votes, unless they were to act in a bipartisan way?
to limit the cost of medical care, they decided to alter the way medicare paid for services and a change in the tax treatment of employer coverage.
on tuesday night, warren turned that claim into a vow.
2: what time is joe biden speaking today?
kavanaugh called roe v. wade, the landmark reproductive rights supreme court opinion, an important precedent that has been reaffirmed many times, including in planned parenthood v. casey. responding to a comment from sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) about not wanting to go back to a time when abortion was outlawed, kavanaugh said, i don't live in a bubble. i live in the real world.
i support coverage for pre-existing provisions, and congress should act to make sure that happens. i think what we need to do is make sure we have affordable health care, sen. cory gardner (r-colo.), who is facing a tough campaign, told reporters on tuesday.
but parnell has mostly run on kitchen-table economic issues, promising to cut taxes for working families, close corporate tax loopholes, and protect social security and medicare.
living in an institution is more expensive than fixing the spend-down.
last week, in a formal request for comment″ published in the federal register, the office of management and budget asked for input regarding how the government adjusts the official poverty measure for inflation each year. currently, a family of four is officially poor if the household earns less than $25,465 annually. later this year, the government will update the number based on the rise in prices for things like food and shelter since last year.
and while in the past fox largely passed along the gop version of events and magnified stories that helped republicans ― the benghazi attacks and the irs targeting scandal under president barack obama, for example ― during the trump presidency the network seems to have gone even further to stifle criticism against him, particularly from republicans.
but high out-of-pocket costs are increasingly a reality for americans with private insurance, whether it's employer coverage or policies that people buy on their own, including through healthcare.gov. and that is to say nothing of the 28 million people who remain uninsured.
and, try the dang octopus, intrepid one... you never know.
the other big worry about allowing farm bureau plans is that they would draw healthy people away from comprehensive policies, like the ones available at healthcare.gov, making those policies more expensive for those people who need it. and it's a danger that's now national, because the trump administration has been making it possible for traditional insurers to offer policies that, like the farm bureau plans, are not subject to the affordable care act standards.
donnelly repeatedly asked rexnord to reconsider, staging press conferences about the plight of its workers. and he visited the white house several times, unsuccessfully pushing trump on legislation that would punish federal contractors that move jobs abroad.
what would be terrific from the point of view of trump voters? well, in a new york times op-ed last week, the kaiser family foundation's drew altman reported on a series of focus groups conducted with rust belt trump voters who are either on medicaid or enrolled in insurance plans through the affordable care act. their responses were very interesting.
in macon, he cited support from former university of georgia football star herschel walker to win favor from his rally crowd. how good was herschel walker? trump said as the georgia crowd roared. he's on our side, and he's an incredible guy.
in june, the trump administration did so by making it easier for people to enroll in so-called association health plans, which serve small businesses and are not subject to all of the affordable care act's regulations. now it is easing the restrictions on short-term plans, which the obama administration had eventually limited to durations of no more than three months with no possibility of renewal (although insurers sometimes sold packets of plans at once, so that people could string together consecutive policies for up to a year).
the trump administration is changing that. these association health plans could evade the benefit rules and also charge premiums based on workers ages, occupations and places of business.
even amid the comey testimony, and all of the attention it deserves, don't let health care be forgotten, leonhardt wrote this week. it's too important.
the trump administration plopped down its request for input with total disregard for that debate, said sharon parrott, a senior fellow with the liberal center on budget and policy priorities. people had been arguing over the validity of the measure itself, not over its annual inflation adjustments. but the federal register notice provides no details about the shortcomings of the poverty measure.
the reason is straightforward: profits, she concluded. a private insurance company maximizes its profits by bringing in the most money possible from customers and paying out the least money possible for their health care.
if trump's chaotic, even juvenile approach to the presidency has surprised americans who only started paying attention to the 2016 presidential race in its final weeks, gop leaders who had followed the primary as it unfolded in 2015 had a much better grasp of what they were facing.
price would, for example, allow insurers to sell policies that only cover generic prescription drugs or that set limits on how many rehabilitation service visits a patient could have in a year, levitt said.

trump won missouri by 19 percentage points in 2016, but some democrats believe former vice president joe biden can keep the race close enough to give galloway a shot at victory.
it's a new year with a new speaker, but the same old story - the decades long saga of republican attacks on women's health care and their health care providers. the gop continues to target not only constitutionally-protected abortions and planned parenthood, but, incredibly, birth control which 99 per cent of american women depend on during their reproductive years. in their budget republicans completely eliminated title x funding for family planning.
the united states will one day have to take cost effectiveness into account. there is no doubt about it at all. you cannot keep on increasing your health care costs at the rate you are for so poor return. you are 29th in the world in life expectancy. you pay twice as much for health care as anyone else on god's earth. (12)
travis washington is ready for sanders to transform the nation's health care system.
corlette noted that the affordable care act modifies a number of existing laws, like those covering patient privacy and regulating employer conduct, and that since its enactment, those laws have been modified by statute or regulation. the fate of those modifications, like the recent change to the doughnut hole, would be up in the air.
there are also plenty of examples of russian associates offering the trump campaign help. mueller concluded in his report that, in some instances, the campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances, campaign officials shied away.
in an attempt to make up for scrapping the affordable care act's guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, the house republican bill would set aside $100 billion over a decade to finance state programs that would cover people with the highest medical costs.
it's unlikely, however, that a bill repealing obamacare can get to the president's desk with democrats, who support the law, now in control of the house.

republican congressional leaders have not been shy about where they believe the bulk of the credit for these achievements should go.
in a true toss-up, trump has to start doing better here, jessica taylor, of the nonpartisan cook political report, said of michigan. but in the broader scheme of things ... republicans have sort of succeeded in keeping this competitive.
research has shown that babies in low-income homes are less likely to be breastfed. the investigations help explain why. not only do low-wage women typically have to return to work sooner after having a child, many of them also have a difficult time getting breaks from their employers to pump.
instead, trump once again played up his success in undoing one of the law's less popular features: the individual mandate requiring all americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.
after the collapse of the gop effort to repeal the barack obama administrations's affordable care act and enact a different set of reforms to the health care system friday, trump inherited programs that aren't going anywhere and that serve tens of millions of americans.
it is possible president clinton will declare eminent domain in new jersey. next, she will relocate our residents to vermont and give the illegals to new jersey. she may also give the illegals the state of nj, whichever is more costly to the nation. the day after her inauguration, atlantic city will be vacated and declared uninhabitable.
democrats now have control in 14 states, plus the district of columbia.
under the gop health care replacement legislation, older and low-income americans who want to buy private health insurance would be hit the hardest, receiving less generous tax credits than they do under obamacare. younger and more affluent people, on the other hand, would receive more assistance than they currently do.
how republicans undermined their own argument
it's not unusual for the governing party to use budget reconciliation to pass major legislation. democrats used the legislative maneuver to get most of the affordable care act through in 2010, republicans used reconciliation to pass their tax bill in 2017, and they also attempted to repeal obamacare through the budgetary process that year, albeit unsuccessfully.
washington ― republicans could have run on preserving employer-based health insurance. they could have run against democratic plans to enact medicare for all and moved beyond the gop's doomed efforts in 2017 to repeal obamacare and replace it with an unpopular bill that would have undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
the federal government would continue to provide funds for any expansion enrollee who was on the program before 2020 ― until he or she left medicaid.
in economics, seigniorage is defined as the profits made by a ruler or government from the production of what? (currency/money/coinage)
president trump and gov. bevin are making kentucky great again, a narrator said in one of the final ads from the republican governors association. but socialists in washington want to impeach trump and take us backward. andy beshear is part of their radical resistance.
mcconnell's approval rating among swing-state voters in the survey is just 26%, with 50% viewing him unfavorably. among independents, just 18% view him favorably, and 58% have a negative opinion. in counties that swung from former president barack obama to president trump, his approval rating is 25%, while 53% have a negative opinion.
his showing up probably energized democrats as much as it did republicans, self, the kentucky democratic party chairman, said. while they had folks sitting in an arena, we had folks knocking on doors. and one of those certainly affects an election more than the other.
the purchase is designed to augment the company's enterprise compliance platform and help compliance personnel better manage the huge amount of data that is an inevitable part of their job.
the progress we have seen in recent years is hugely important, not just because of those who have been helped, but also because we now have an irrefutable body of evidence demonstrating that paid sick days policies work well for employers as well as workers, said ness, pointing to research showing how paid sick time has little impact on profitability and in some cases has boosted productivity among workers.
in minnesota and new york, people with incomes too high for medicaid have another option: the affordable care act's basic health program. minnesota's minnesotacare and new york's essential plan are open to people who earn up to twice the poverty level, which is about $32,000 for a single person. new yorkers may have to pay up to $20 a month for the essential plan, and minnesotans may have to pay up to $80 a month for minnesotacare coverage.

that penalty, known as the individual mandate, was the subject of a celebrated 2012 case in which the supreme court upheld the law, with chief justice john roberts joining the four liberals, on the grounds that the mandate was a constitutionally permissible tax.
a breitbart spokesman declined to make boyle or editor-in-chief alexander marlow available for interviews.
to say that argument has flaws is generous. it's genuinely difficult to find a respectable legal scholar who will vouch for it. but in december 2018, it prevailed before a federal district judge, the conservative reed o'connor, who agreed that the entire law is invalid.
but there are barriers to getting new coverage, including wide variances in what's available from state to state, red tape and cost. those burdens will weigh even heavier on people who are also trying to sign up for unemployment insurance, housing aid and food benefits as they adjust to a new reality.
this time, with mcconnell saying he doesn't see the urgency for another measure, democrats are moving forward with their own bill — one that more closely hews to their priorities.
joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, grace eline. every birthday since she was 4, grace asked her friends to donate to st. jude children's research hospital. she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. last year, grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. immediately, she began radiation treatment. at the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. when grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: last day of chemo. grace ― you are an inspiration to us all.
what the supreme court could do
economically, they are not natural allies of the party of business or its wealthy donors, who tend to focus on tax cuts and free-market principles irrelevant to the base. so in exchange for pursuing its economic agenda, the party offered evangelicals a faith-based vision of america: barring abortion, banning gay marriage, and giving government preferences to fundamentalist religious institutions. why should business people care, the reasoning went, when we can rally these voters with promises which, however illusory, cost us nothing?
she thanked people for their kind words and prayers for her dad, adding: it really means so much for my family.
one way rural voters get hit is through the fact that tax credits proposed under the republican health care plan are not as generous as those under obamacare. for instance, in the reno, nevada, market, a 60-year-old person who earns $40,000 would get almost $2,000 less to buy health insurance in 2020, a kaiser foundation analysis found. nationally, the average cost hike for that person is nearly $3,000, and in some locales, such as mobile, alabama, the difference is an eye-popping $6,000.
gergen said on a cnn panel following trump's speech that bringing your campaign speech into the presidency is something presidents rarely do. he added: i think this is the most divisive speech i've ever heard from a sitting american president.
an even more telling exchange came later on, as the discussion turned to what is probably the most important part of the plaintiff's case ― and also the weakest. congress originally intended for the affordable care act's different pieces to work together, the plaintiffs said, and so if the mandate goes away, the rest of the law should, too.
as i said from the start, if the positivity rate rose above 10%, the state of texas would take further action to mitigate the spread of covid-19, abbott said in a release. at this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including texans congregating in bars.
associated press vice president mike pence and republican u.s. senate candidate john james sit for lunch at the engine house in mount clemens, michigan, in june.
but this may be a case in which a plan's details matter less than the signal it sends ― about the future of the democratic party and maybe about the health care system as well.
for now, the focus of politics is the pandemic. and if it highlights the affordable care act's shortcomings, the law's architects, like deparle, say it also reinforces an idea that is part of the law's core philosophy: that it makes sense to insure everybody because everybody is vulnerable. it was important to get this foundation laid ― of everybody being in the system together, she said.
the case is now before a federal district judge in texas. on thursday, five well-known legal scholars were among those filing briefs urging the judge to reject the lawsuit.
there is no assurance that congress will do anything to redress the impacts of this year's deadlocked supreme court verdicts, or be moved to help lead-poisoned children, or even feel especially responsible if more children are born with microcephaly because lawmakers were slow to respond.
because i love you so much, i obamacare about you more than you even know, he added.
the other, clearer tradeoff is the price tag to the federal government. the 10-year cost of biden's plan would be $850 billion, according to an estimate from the committee for a responsible federal budget. that is a lot of money and it will have to come from somewhere.
sentara slashed lawsuit volume by using software to rule out patients who were unlikely to pay, said spokesman dale gauding. we write off a lot of bad debt rather than put someone through a judgment they can't pay and an additional black mark on their credit, he said.
the fact that prep is largely used by men older than 25 further limits truvada's power to prevent new infections among black msm, since 45 percent of new cases among black msm are in 13- to 24-year-olds, compared with just 16 percent among their white counterparts. prep is not even approved for those younger than 18, and recent research suggests that teen msm have trouble adhering to prep unless they are seen for monthly clinic visits, a considerable undertaking.
this is just plain stupid. repealing something without knowing if a replacement would be worse is dumb. it would also harm millions. https://t.co/bq1zjwblfs — ted lieu (@tedlieu) june 30, 2017
it no longer is obamacare because, without the individual mandate, it's much different, trump said.
she shied away from backing the call to defund the police, noting that virginia has to have a balanced budget, and you have to look at it holistically and ask what are our needs and how do we allocate our resources so that the greatest needs are met.
and in fact that's precisely what western wayne has been doing. it opened its third clinic in 2014, once it was clear the medicaid expansion was going forward, and it's in the process of opening a fourth. it's hired new therapists and a new psychiatrist, and created a new integrated behavioral health program. it's also built out a new dental service, meeting a need that rarely gets attention in the media but that makes a huge difference in people's ability to join the workforce and, more generally, engage in everyday life.
far more real are the catastrophic prospects of another two years of total gop control. if republicans squeak by in both chambers and have another two-year runway to do whatever they want, to grab whatever they can and to rig the 2020 election, we don't have to imagine what will happen.
even if that's not true, a victorious beshear would take control of a state where democrats face a long, grinding battle to shift power back in their direction, at least outside of reliably blue cities like louisville and lexington and in suburban counties that may trend their way over time. the structural advantages for republicans are going to hold through for the next decade, i think, lasley said.
alaska and minnesota already are taking matters into their own hands to improve the health insurance markets in their states. health and human services secretary tom price has invited states to apply for waivers the affordable care act created that could give them flexibility to redesign the exchanges themselves.
feminism doesn't mean anything that's good for an individual, particular woman. it doesn't mean one individual woman gaining power. feminism is a movement for liberation from gender and sex oppression, said jaclyn friedman, a feminist writer, activist and co-editor of believe me: how trusting women can change the world.
on one hand, veterans want the convenience and flexibility of veterans choice. on the other, veteran service organizations, like the american legion, have drawn a line in the sand to defend va health care.
john james has a trump problem
among democrats surveyed, 68% have favorable views of job-based private health insurance, which is the most common form of coverage for working-age adults and their dependents. support for private insurance from the exchanges is lower among democrats at 47%. notably, medicaid and medicare are the highest-rated forms of insurance, with 85% and 84% (respectively) of democrats having favorable views of the programs.
in the ads, quist discusses his own pre-existing condition from gallbladder surgery, claiming he is one of an estimated half of montanans who have what would be considered a pre-existing condition.
which means that the fortunes of congressional republicans are in all probability tied to the president's behavior in the coming months, with success riding on his ability to settle down and act more presidential. gop leaders are not optimistic.
people in relatively good health will increasingly sign up for short-term plans, which will be cheaper because they are less widely available and cover fewer services than more regulated affordable care act plans. people with more serious medical needs won't make the shift, leaving existing plans with a less healthy pool ― forcing insurers to raise premiums for those plans by 18 percent, according to urban institute researchers.
on judges in particular, she has never drawn any hard ideological lines. she has voted to confirm five supreme court justices across the ideological spectrum and then watched some of them vote against abortion rights.
i want the losing party in every case to come out and say, 'kavanaugh gave me a fair shake,' the nominee replied when asked what makes a good supreme court justice.
the supreme court rejected that lawsuit in 2015. it was the second time the high court upheld the constitutionality of the law known as obamacare. the first time was in 2012, in a case called nfib v. sebelius. somin was an influential, high-profile supporter of the lawsuit and the author of a brief supporting it.
the african american community has yet to vote in numbers that could propel a candidate, south carolina democratic party chair trav robertson told huffpost. there is clearly a path here but the african american community has to be engaged.
when asked by huffpost about the veracity of this claim, the wwe at first offered a cryptic answer. this is the first time we're hearing about amy mekelburg, said a corporate spokesperson last thursday, requesting not to be identified by name.
in their 2014 book, social insurance: america's neglected heritage and contested future, theodore marmor, jerry mashaw and john pakutka drew this important conclusion about the effects of free market policies in our health care and the need for more government involvement:
barrett, a federal appeals court judge, is trump's third selection for the court, enabling him to remake it in dramatic fashion as part of his success in moving the broader federal judiciary to the right since taking office in 2017.
and despite his reputation in washington as a brilliant political mind, mcconnell isn't a very accomplished machiavellian. he has no great federal legislative achievement to bequeath to future generations (or, at least, biographers). his major work to date is his title. after battling to become senate majority leader, he now needs to decorate his crown. it doesn't particularly matter which jewels he selects, but it will be a very sad crown without any at all. repealing obamacare would be a big sparkler.
that means they have to campaign in the reddest parts of idaho. it also means they have to spread out across a state that's the 14th largest by area and sixth-least dense by population. at least the medicaid mobile, which broke down during a stop in hailey last month, is up and running again.
the pocket constitution is a symbol of american values
immediately prior to the federal government abandoning its defense of the law, a trio of justice department lawyers removed their names from the government's brief, and joel mcelvain, a 20-year veteran of the department, quit in protest. trump nominated the lead lawyer who remained, chad readler, for a federal judgeship the same day the department submitted its brief; the senate confirmed him last march.
but even attentive consumers might not grasp the implications of what that language means, according to the insurance regulators. and these officials should know, because they are the ones who monitor marketing materials and hear from consumers when they get bills they didn't expect.
those federal judges trump brags about, including supreme court justice neil gorsuch? with few exceptions, they are products of the federalist society, the conservative group to which trump outsourced the choosing of judicial nominees in 2016, combined with mcconnell's readiness to ram those names through his senate despite democratic objections.
there are so many parts of this budget proposal that are not in the weeds. the cuts to medicare? that's not in the weeds. cuts to medicaid — which is the no. 1 source of funding for opioid treatment in new jersey and in many other states — that's not in the weeds, he said. that's very real for people.
for the past five years, the senator has fully complied with federal law and all senate ethics requirements, his spokesman said in april.
but the farm bureau won't make public its study on the impact of its proposed policies, while actuaries have said repeatedly that making non-compliant plans even more available than they are today could destabilize markets. in tennessee, the state where farm bureau plans have the largest membership, many experts believe they have made comprehensive coverage more expensive ― making tennessee's already sick insurance market even sicker, as a 2017 report in stat put it.
it's remarkable that this mix of less effort and higher costs didn't cause enrollment to plummet. sign-ups did fall this year to 11.8 million, about 400,000 less than for 2017. but it's telling that the decline occurred almost entirely in the 39 states where the federal government runs the exchanges. enrollment was flat in state-run exchanges in 11 states and the district of columbia because they weren't affected by trump's budget cuts and because most held longer enrollment periods.
so it was a real surprise when my edit drew fresh attention to my account. after all, one of my profile pictures was of me with a hillary clinton cut-out, taken at the democratic headquarters in st. petersburg. didn't most men look only at the pictures?
immigrant rights groups have been urging democrats to demand dreamer relief as part of must-pass spending bills since trump rescinded daca. their logic ― based on years of experience ― is that a standalone bill to help dreamers will languish if it's not attached to another measure because republican leaders won't give it a vote, even if it has the support to pass.
the families usa conference is frequently the site of important policy announcements by likely presidential contenders. then-sen. barack obama (d-ill.) used his 2007 speech to the group to present his vision for universal health care.

if trump actually follows through on his vow, his will be providing one of a growing number of competing ― and vague ― gop proposals to remake the health care system, which doesn't portend rapid action in congress.
such a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on medicare today. hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world ― and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.
now, she says, we live in a very different time, one of mass incarceration and mass criminalization. the population has grown 40 percent, but the prison population has grown 500 percent, and any hesitation that existed about locking up women doesn't exist anymore, especially for black, brown and poor women, who are the ones most likely to have abortions.
there remains speculation whether bannon, who was a fierce critic of the republican establishment while leading breitbart, is behind the site's opposition to the bill or has at least sanctioned it (even while advising a president who publicly supports it).
judging by the massive protest and organizing efforts, many americans understand that our futures, and our very lives, depend on this. but there's enough denial and complacency ― and hate and resentment ― among enough of the public that winning is not a done deal.
meanwhile, mcconnell is convening the senate next week, contrary to washington shelter-in-place orders and the senate physician's saying he doesn't have enough kits to test all senators for coronavirus.
but in predicting how barrett would approach this challenge, there is one complicating factor. most experts consider the new case, which comes from a group of republican state officials and has the backing of the trump administration, to be a lot weaker.
the interfaith leaders at tuesday's event believe it's time to change that narrative.

i never would have believed i could've fallen in love with someone who voted for donald trump, but by learning to put love above all else, the pains in my heart — physical and emotional — have finally disappeared.
steve helber/associated press virginia state sen. jennifer mcclellan (d) is throwing her hat into the ring to become governor in 2021.
for his entire administration, president trump has used every tool and every chance he gets to weaken or rip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions, she said. if president trump cared at all about people with pre-existing conditions, he would drop his lawsuit to overturn the affordable care act in the middle of a pandemic.
and the new government spending would buy something important: an expansion of insurance to around 95% of the population, with more generous insurance overall for those who have coverage.
democratic sen. dick durbin of illinois agreed barrett is making history — but as the first nominee considered so close to a presidential election, tapped to fulfill the president's public quest to install a ninth justice in time to undo the affordable care act in a case heading to the court nov. 10.
at least that's how republican leaders have articulated the plan.
as for people who want smaller deductibles or more provider choices, they can choose policies that come with moderately higher premiums. priority offers a silver-level hmo with a $2,500 deductible for $312 a month ― and again, that's before subsidies on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. the plan's network includes every major teaching hospital in the area and, according to lolli, the vast majority of physicians as well. overall, detroit-area residents can choose from 83 different plans, with roughly half the plans in the silver category that the majority of consumers use.
but go back and look at my twitter feed for the last year. it's not hard to figure out what i believe in.
i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchik. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight ― seated side-by-side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.
i personally don't think it has been nearly as divisive as kavanaugh was. one, because everybody knew what was going to happen. with kavanaugh, one or two folks were undecided. nobody ever had any reason to think that the president would be removed from office, sen. roy blunt (r-mo.) said.

it was only after the bill appeared to fail in the house, and attention turned elsewhere, that republican leaders were able to modify it and put together the votes they needed for passage ― and then stage a vote before opposition could mobilize all over again.
i asked her who she'd vote for and she said donald trump, chaffetz told huffpost this week.
trump has come to own the american health care act, even making a direct pitch during a closed-door meeting with house republicans on tuesday. the continued opposition to the bill may be the first signal that trump's political capital doesn't run very deep in the house gop conference, and that republicans, particularly conservative ones, aren't afraid to cross the president.
an illustration of what this might look like in practice is medicare for america legislation, from reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and jan schakowsky (d-ill.), that would allow private insurance to operate alongside a new public program. the delauro-schakowsky bill, which promises universal coverage and has emerged as a leading alternative to medicare for all, would set a ceiling on hospital payments at 110 percent of medicare rates, with allowances for the secretary of health and human services to adjust fees for specific institutions based on their idiosyncratic needs.
biden's assessment was spot on. obamacare turned out to be the administration's most consequential domestic policy achievement. biden felt genuine joy when it passed, former administration officials tell huffpost, and during the legislative process he was instrumental in locking down wavering democratic senators who threatened to sink the entire enterprise.
but over the next few years, the cuts become less generous for those earning the least — and that disproportionately affects minorities far more than whites, according to tax experts and a center for public integrity analysis using census bureau data.
trump might as well replace the andrew jackson painting in the oval office with one of andrew dice clay.
anti-corruption advocates lament the inclusion of trade associations in the new bill because the corporations and other institutions that bankroll them are often already eligible for federal bailout money. the organizations, which enjoy significant clout in washington, had been pushing for the change with the support of some democratic lawmakers.
take the border wall, for instance. congressional republicans have consistently said it's a priority of theirs to secure money for this cornerstone of president donald trump's agenda. but a year and a half into trump's presidency, the wall has not materialized. congress, like mexico, does not seem willing to pay for it.
warren's plan to boost social security benefits is also fertile terrain for populist campaigning without entering the notoriously perilous thicket of health care policy. to that end, her campaign released a new television advertisement in iowa on tuesday touting the proposal, which would immediately increase the program's monthly payments by $200.
there's going to be incremental steps for this, he said, noting he would first push for wisconsin to expand medicaid under obamacare, then push for a public option in the state's badgercare program. it's got to be a stepping stone. we can't get too far ahead of ourselves.
so far, officials from the farm bureau and wellmark have not specified exactly how much of this leeway they plan to use. but they have said that the policies will look like the ones that were available before the affordable care act took effect. those plans had substantially lower premiums precisely because they [were] not available or terribly useful to people with serious medical problems. we do know that this may not be a solution for all, a farm bureau spokesperson conceded to the des moines register.
the 2010 health care law also provides funding for expanding eligibility for medicaid, the program for low-income americans, lots of whom have pre-existing conditions of their own. arizona is among the states that implemented the expansion, even though it had a republican governor at the time, and roughly 400,000 arizona residents have gotten insurance because of it, according to the latest available figures.
trump, nevertheless, pushed ahead, refusing to sign legislation to keep the government operating ― unless he received money for his border wall, which during the campaign he said mexico would pay for.
hearings also increase responsibility, said brookings' reynolds. you're getting views clearly on the record, from outside groups and from experts, she said. if we've brought these witnesses to testify, you're saying, 'congress, you made this choice having heard these witnesses.'
watching president donald trump on tuesday, as he arrived at the capitol and prepared to rally house republicans around replacing the affordable care act, it was hard not think about a similar occasion almost exactly seven years ago: former president barack obama went to capitol hill in march 2010 to urge house democrats to pass the very legislation republicans are now trying to wipe away.
and yet, buttigieg has jones' support in the primary. and it's not simply because the columbia native worked for buttigieg's campaign as an hbcu campus organizer. it's because of what the former mayor represents.
in the meantime, senate republicans have yet to pass an alternative proposal. trump did embrace a bipartisan senate bill capping drug costs for medicare beneficiaries, but the bill has stalled in the senate and he has shown little interest in trying to revive it.
by one estimate, republicans had designated only about one-third of the money required to adequately fund these pools, meaning states would have to come up with the money themselves or, more likely, come up with a slew of regulations to limit the number of people who could get access to the high-risk pools.
though she's been a social worker for much of her professional career, she taught african american history at allen university, a local historically black university in south carolina's capital city. albergottie stressed that black people, young black people, in particular, must understand their history as they head to the ballot box.

you can look at one of these plans and you'll see it covers doctors, hospitals, maybe even drugs, and so you think it will have everything i need, altman said. you won't realize that the amounts are caps, or have exclusions ― it's really difficult to expect that consumers will be able to figure out what all of this means, and really know what they are getting.
like so many women, ginsburg struggled in those early years to balance caring for a young daughter and an ailing father-in-law while her husband, marty, was putting in long hours at work. trapped by the needs of two generations is how de hart put it.
and while the affordable care act was nowhere near as far-reaching as single-payer would be, the changes it brought created widespread anxiety among those who already had health coverage, a political dynamic that dogged obama's white house.
this may not be what most people thought when they heard president donald trump's promise that everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.
after her premiums rose to $1,000 a month for a gold plan in 2018, handler decided to save money by switching to a bronze plan that cost about half as much for less generous coverage, handler said. but she contends that the access health ct representative who helped her enroll gave her incorrect information about the plan's coverage, which led to her accruing nearly $20,000 in unexpected out-of-pocket costs last year, even though all of her medical providers belonged to the insurance company's network.
in different ways, the republican state officials and sessions' justice department argue that a ruling against the pre-existing condition provisions must also be a ruling against other parts of the law or the whole thing.
the government has different ways of tracking inflation that it uses for a variety of purposes, such as adjusting eligibility thresholds for federal programs, repositioning tax brackets, and increasing social security benefits. the trump administration hinted in its request for comment that it might prefer to adjust the poverty threshold with an inflation measure that rises more slowly than the others.

nobody in the administration was more helpful in trying to move this through the process once the president was moving forward, using his instincts about what would and wouldn't fly, said pete rouse, former senior adviser to obama. phil schiliro, who at the time was the white house director of legislative affairs, described biden as 100% on board. there was nothing we asked him to do that he didn't do.
a majority of people who voted for donald trump and are at least 50 years old oppose major components of house republicans' health care bill, according to a poll aarp released tuesday.
bishop then defended his vote on obamacare repeal, saying that the house bill would have taken care of people like his wife and slotkin's mother ― the ones who, historically, struggled to get coverage on the open market. when i voted for that bill, bishop said, there is no way i would have ever voted for it if it hadn't included protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
it's a complete bombshell, abbe gluck, professor of law at yale, told huffpost after learning of the filing on monday evening. the administration went from taking the position that only some of the insurance reforms should be struck down to now saying the entire aca ― medicaid expansion and all ― should go down with this ship. … it's a total 180, with drastic human consequences.

nor is there any evidence that moore's other predictions came true. just a few months ago, the urban institute completed a thorough review of the available research. its conclusion: predictions that the coverage provisions of the aca would lead to reduced employment and work hours did not materialize, nor did predictions that employer-based coverage rates would fall as employers dropped coverage.
thanks to the affordable care act, the federal government now spends tens of billions of dollars each year providing financial assistance to people who buy insurance through healthcare.gov or one of the exchanges (like covered california) that some states run on their own. the financial assistance takes two forms ― tax credits that discount premiums, and direct subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs.

the new meme got a boost after trump bared his idea friday for destroying obamacare in the face of mounting opposition to the senate version of trumpcare to replace it.
the truth is most of this stuff is not that controversial. most americans want everybody to have the health care they need. it still isn't happening. it still is not easy. so this organization has got to be about figuring out why.
that doesn't sound so appealing, which is why bishop is talking about his wife, rohrabacher is running ads that showcase his daughter and hawley keeps bringing up his son. it's one part distraction, one part distortion ― and one part hope that nobody is paying too much attention.
that's the hope. by allowing employers to keep offering coverage and leaving the big programs like medicare and medicaid largely in place, you could reassure voters who get skittish about government forcing them into a new plan.

any savings that ahps offer to healthier-than-average firms and workers likely come at the expense of higher costs for sicker-than-average firms and workers who remain in the aca small-group and individual markets, sarah lueck, senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities, explained earlier this month.
during tuesday's hearing, barrett dodged questions about how she would rule on the case by saying she didn't want to prejudge it. however, she acknowledged she ultimately agreed with scalia's judicial philosophy.
that prospect ought to sound familiar, because it's exactly what happened when the affordable care act took effect and put in place new standards for the insurance that people buy on their own. many insurers responded by canceling the old plans, despite president barack obama's vow that americans who liked their old insurance could keep it.
republicans have said for years that the affordable care act ought to be replaced with a free market alternative that preserves some of the most popular elements of the law, such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing parents to keep children on their health insurance policy until they turn 26 years old.
the one thing that everyone agrees on is that obamacare is far from perfect. there are many that believe it is a good start and many who have benefitted from it since its inception. so why can't we use it as a starting point and work on the fixes needed to make it better? why did the republicans feel the need to introduce an entirely new bill (which, by the way, kept many of the most popular provisions of the affordable care act) instead of bringing both parties together to fix what already has a foundation of support. it became clear that the freedom caucus was not going to be happy until every reasonable consumer protection was completely stripped from ahca, but there certainly was considerable consensus on keeping things like no denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions and keeping your kids on your plan until the age of 26. why don't we just fix it and call it obamatrumpcare?

as far as other issues, pence:
though the election between trump and democratic challenger joe biden will largely be a referendum on the president's mishandling of the pandemic, he still hasn't laid out a comprehensive strategy to beat it. his plan for months has basically been asking people to grit their teeth and bear it.
we took over an obsolete, broken testing system that wouldn't have worked for even a small problem, let alone one of the biggest pandemics in history, trump said saturday, a day after claiming: we inherited a broken, old — frankly, a terrible system.
after she launched her campaign for president, senator harris confirmed her support for the sanders bill, but then, after being pressed about the ramifications of denying voters the choice of private health insurance plans, began a long and confusing pattern of equivocating about her stance on health care in america, the biden campaign said. that pattern has now taken yet another twist.

and she laments the pressure to cut social security and medicare as the gop tax cuts add $1.5 trillion to the national debt.

in many cases, middle managers apparently ignored breastfeeding policies that were already in place. some readily admitted they did not know the law; others understood their obligations but didn't want to take the extra steps necessary to accommodate a worker. sometimes an employer made what seemed to be a good-faith effort to help employees pump but still failed to comply with the law.

instead, the two governors are calling for new programs ― and spending ― to shore up the health insurance market for people who find affordable care act exchange policies too expensive. in new york, the mayor is eyeing a local plan to use city money to cover medical expenses for uninsured residents. the california and new york city proposals include assistance for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal programs like medicaid and the health insurance exchanges.

but the 5th circuit judges sent the case back to o'connor to parse through the statute more carefully and decide whether some parts of it can survive. that order threatens to keep the case tied up in litigation for up to three years, given that o'connor's decision would likely prompt yet another appeal to the 5th circuit, whose eventual decision would almost certainly invite an appeal to the supreme court.

but, unless i missed it, in all this discussion there was no talk ― none ― coming from the super-rich that such tax cuts were not necessary, were too much of a muchness, were in fact unseemly, given that 24 million people would have lost their insurance, only to benefit the already overflowing coffers of the rich.

meanwhile, the texas case has already taken one unexpected, but critical, turn. in june, the trump administration's lawyers at the justice department filed a brief supporting the lawsuit. customarily, justice department lawyers defend federal statutes, even ones that the administration in power doesn't like, in order to meet the president's constitutional obligation that the laws be faithfully executed.

notwithstanding the policy differences between the program buttigieg has in mind and the one sanders and warren envision, on thursday he described his plan in the same way that they do, by emphasizing his desire to confront and overcome special interests that have historically resisted aggressive reforms designed to make health care more affordable.
we do think those plans will be very attractive to those who have been most poorly served by the affordable care act, said randy pate, a deputy administrator at the centers for medicare and medicaid services. he mentioned in particular younger and healthier people who think comprehensive coverage isn't worth the expense. this could be an option for them.

that alone is a pretty stark divide. roughly 20 million people could lose insurance if the lawsuit is successful, according to estimates by the urban institute, to say nothing of the guarantees of coverage for people with preexisting conditions that would also go away.
but by that logic, the rest of the affordable care act shouldn't be in jeopardy either. the supposed constitutional problem in the law, the one at the heart of the lawsuit, is a financial penalty (the individual mandate) that congress canceled two years ago as part of the trump tax cut. the affordable care act currently operates without it.
but when she chose a replacement plan from access health ct, her state's health insurance exchange, she ran into one of the many glitches that characterized the first year of obamacare enrollment. at the time, handler had a procedure scheduled to test her for lung cancer, which both of her parents had had. but the insurance company told her she wasn't actually covered because they never got her enrollment information from the exchange. only after huffpost spoke to the head of access health ct about handler did the problem get resolved.
trump had a point about biden's record on immigration and criminal justice reform
collins was never going to be the savior of roe v. wade. no amount of liberal wishcasting was going to change that.
here's the thing with the economics of it: we spend $10,000 per person in this country on health care. and so we have to recognize that the way we pay for prescription drugs, the way we do medicare advantage bidding, the way we do lots and lots of things are done in ways that aren't necessarily getting the best deal for the taxpayer or the consumer.
ryan also argued that getting rid of those taxes would help with the gop's tax reform efforts later this year.
another way to think of the plan is that it would replicate the existing medicare structure for seniors, although with some key enhancements. the new plan would have much more generous benefits, for example. like the insurance available under the sanders bill, the harris plan envisions no major out-of-pocket spending for the services covered, including basic medical, dental and vision services.
one of the most compelling pieces of research was a byproduct of federal efforts to boost insurance enrollment. in 2016 and early 2017, the treasury department identified 4.6 million people who hadn't signed up for insurance and sent letters to 3.9 million of them.
while losing employer-based health benefits enables people to enroll on the exchanges, that's not the case for people who didn't have employer-based health benefits to begin with. these people must wait until the next open enrollment period.
so today's health care battle carries greater significance for the senate majority leader than for anyone else in congress. mcconnell still has no ideological dog in this fight. but he has to prove to his fellow republicans that their faith in him is correctly placed. and he has to prove to himself that his decades-long power struggle hasn't been in vain. he may well lose, but he will not walk away from a fight on which his legacy depends.
bush and his administration had wreaked havoc on the american people in that first term. folks were mad thirsty for something, for someone, for anything, that would offer them an alternative to what we felt, to be blunt, was evil and sheer stupidity in the white house. obama embodied that.
but this round of briefs included one from the attorneys general of montana and ohio, timothy fox and dave yost. they are conservative republicans from states with lots of conservative voters, and in their brief they make an especially conservative legal argument.
the federal medicaid law, which dates back to 1965, requires that states seeking major changes get special permission from the federal government. the obama administration looked askance at work requirements on the theory that they could harm beneficiaries, which would be a clear violation of the medicaid statute.
ditto other members of the middle and working classes. the real causes of their woes are globalization, the great recession, the housing crisis, and an information society which marginalizes blue-collar jobs. but the gop never addressed these complex forces with any kind of candor -- let alone proposed solutions like job retraining and educational access for their kids.
o'connor's ruling last december came in a case filed by texas and a coalition of republican-led states. he said that without a tax penalty, the law's requirement that most americans have insurance is unconstitutional. democratic attorneys general, led by california's xavier becerra, and the u.s. house of representatives have appealed.

some sites send the two-drug protocol, but others just a single drug — misoprostol. taken alone it is nearly as effective as the tandem protocol, but about one-tenth the price of mifepristone, and easier to buy because it is also widely sold for other purposes, like ulcer treatment. a study of 1,000 women in ireland before the country voted to legalize abortion earlier this year found that women who bought drugs over the internet and self-medicated did so safely and with few complications. other studies have found that when pills are purchased online, the product delivered is almost always as advertised, though the potential for ineffective fakes always exists.

but it's also the most conservative state to establish a state-run health insurance exchange, your health idaho. gov. c.l. butch otter has proposed health care reforms that would extend coverage to some of those who'd qualify for medicaid under an expansion, but legislators haven't acted on them. that's despite a unanimous 2012 recommendation by otter's hand-picked medicaid expansion working group that the state expand the program.
if trump gives in on the house republican lawsuit or if congress refuses to fund the cost-sharing reductions, it could blow up the insurance exchanges quickly. health insurance companies might be able to leave the markets right away, tossing millions off their plans to prevent facing billions of dollars in losses. and they wouldn't come back.
the bill effectively repeals medicaid as we know it, and replaces it with a system of limited block grants to states that pays per person, rather than by the cost of health care expenses. the difference will need to be made up by the 70 million elderly, poor and working-class people on medicaid. while people often think of medicare as the principal health care program for the elderly, it is medicaid that covers nursing care.
i think it's ludicrous. i can't believe in this country we're going to ignore health care for people, robert gogats, a constituent of macarthur's who identified himself as a registered republican, told huffpost.
climate denial. in the anti-science world of the gop, man-made global warming is a hoax -- just ask ted cruz or donald trump. this is one of many areas where the party perpetuates ignorance among its base, separating them from the populace at large. in a recent gallup poll asking if human activity was a factor in climate change, a 85 percent of democrats and 68 percent of independents answered yes. republicans? only 38 percent. faced with overwhelming scientific consensus, the party will not even consider how to combat this existential menace.
in doing so, he echoed house speaker paul ryan, who said on entitlement reform — the sanitized name for privatizing medicare, raising the retirement age and gutting medicaid — that he thinks the election will have to determine that. indeed, house republicans have been consistent in making their desires plain in their budgets. as the washington post reported after the passage of the tax bill, house gop plan would cut medicare, medicaid to balance budget.

the federal government would still be spending a lot of money on tax breaks for people getting health care. but it wouldn't steer that money in the way that the affordable care act does ― in other words, it wouldn't target people who struggle the most with medical bills.
medicare for all has been getting attention and generating excitement in no small part because, even with the affordable care act in place, tens of millions of americans are struggling with health care bills, sometimes with tragic consequences. but the case for medicare for all specifically, as the best remedy to this problem, isn't as simple as proponents frequently make it seem.
these plans have existed for a long time. but they could not last for more than three months under regulations the obama administration put in place ― and they would not count toward the individual mandate.
warren is considered a leading contender for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
republicans received their chance in the 2016 elections, which handed the party control of both chambers of congress and the white house. but they failed to get the job done last year as voters realized what they'd be losing and public opinion swung in favor of the law. the gop has shown no signs of trying to take up repeal again this year.
she agreed there are many laws that protect the right to vote, including the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution, but stopped short of a blanket statement: i really can't say anything more.
mueller has said that if he had to testify, he would reiterate what's already in the report. but democrats are hoping this time will somehow be different.
it's a perfect storm for al gross, said jim lottsfeldt, a lobbyist and political consultant who has advised moderate alaskan politicians from both parties. there's been no better time for him to say, 'it's time to send a doctor to washington.'
right now, there is a healthy debate between privatizing or preserving the department of veterans affairs (va) health care system. at the center of this discussion is the veterans choice program. this program allows veterans to seek care outside of the va health care system. veterans choice has emerged as the tipping point on partial privatization of the va.
bill and hillary clinton at the reception of donald trump and melania knauss in palm beach, fla., on january 22, 2005
in 2000, trump said it was important for americans to have universal health care, with the then 42 million who were uninsured at the time. trump said as a country, we take care of our own but now the presidential hopeful is changing his tone in hopes to eradicate obamacare and possibly utilize a 'health savings account', which has been discussed by republican candidate ben carson.
bevin isn't doing it. neither did arkansas gov. asa hutchinson (r), who succeeded a democrat in 2014 and is negotiating with the state's gop legislature to extend the expansion there.
earlier this year, one of those co-sponsors and presidential candidates, sen. kamala harris (d-ca.), answered a question about coverage of undocumented residents by saying she would oppose any effort to deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period.
trump backed and celebrated the 2017 gop repeal bill
in fact, the individual mandate was not that central a feature of the law.
that business model, questionable even for actual businesses, wound up generating pure turmoil in the west wing in the early months. trump would take meetings with whomever on his staff happened to stroll into the oval office. his tendency to accept the advice of the last person he has listened to meant the white house frequently was sending out conflicting messages on policy positions. when republicans in congress tried to repeal and replace the affordable care act, for example, they were often confronted by trump's own changing positions – confusion that was further compounded by his lack of knowledge or interest in the topic.
the blocked trump rule would allow any nonprofit or for-profit employer, including publicly held companies, to seek an exemption on religious grounds. a moral objection can be made by nonprofits and companies that are not publicly traded.
in may 2016, mekelburg achieved twitter stardom when the new york times featured @amymek in a column about trump's female supporters. the column quoted ms. mek making excuses for trump's misogyny. the writer, emma roller, had interviewed mekelburg over twitter, but failed to ascertain her identity or address her bigotry. mekelburg told roller that she was too busy for a phone interview, according to emails between roller and maureen erwin. later, mekelburg gloated to her neighbors about her media appearance, pointing to the story on her computer. (she'd doxed herself again.)
neglecting to mention the trade-offs in policy is, of course, pretty standard fare in politics. and that's certainly been true in the debate over the aca.
tenet healthcare, a national, for-profit chain whose stock trades on wall street, says it does not sue uninsured patients who are unemployed or who lack significant assets other than their house.
new mexico democrats passed obamacare protections, guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions regardless of federal changes to health care policy.
mekelburg appeared to operate without fear of fallout anywhere. as this story neared publication, she kept tweeting hate, even when her husband's job was in jeopardy. last friday, after huffpost asked the wwe a second time if anyone there had known about @amymek before hiring siino, the company responded definitively.
this approach represented a compromise on what most democrats considered an ideal system. and once the congressional debate began, leaders had to make even more concessions. they faced unrelenting hostility from republicans, but also resistance from many in their own party.
there is a right-wing movement out there that is definitely interested in busting norms and challenging laws and precedents that seem to be well-established, said martin.
as a candidate for president, i pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars.
these are easy promises to make and very difficult promises to keep ― not least because, as trump noted, health care policy is complicated. and his previous statements and proposals make it impossible to guess what he really wants to do.
he said they opened a jerusalem embassy for less than $500,000. early documents show it was at least $21 million.
but some experts say the administration is handling the matter in a way that is unnecessarily slow and disruptive ― and is a direct outgrowth of gop hostility to obamacare.
we all know he's using the hitler playbook. spread the big lie, blame one single minority (or two) for all of your problems and eliminate them at any cost.
· billions of dollars in health costs would be shifted to the states, which will no longer be able to turn to the federal government for resources to care for more people in need because of economic downturns or emergencies.
medi-share has covered even much larger bills, michael gardner, the senior director of marketing and communications at medi-share's parent organization, said in written responses to questions from huffpost. (the company denied requests for interviews.) in one instance, according to gardner, members shared $2.29 million in expenses for an infant with severe medical problems. sixteen members have had more than $1 million in bills they were able to share with other members, he said.
the nominee's appearance before the senate energy and natural resources committee comes shortly after interior's internal watchdog announced a pair of ethics investigations into multiple high-ranking agency officials. one of those probes targets newly confirmed secretary david bernhardt, while the other is looking into allegations against six officials who maintained close ties to their former employers.
their benefits will be designed to drive away sick people with chronic conditions … the population that will choose these policies will have to be very healthy, anderson wrote.
my parents attempted to hide all of this from me as best they could, but debt collectors called me while i was sick in bed and sent medical bills directly to me. the only thing that was worse than my unrelenting pain was the guilt i felt about what i was doing to my parents.
national republicans argued that their strategy of nationalizing the race was effective — beshear's negative ratings from voters rose slowly throughout the campaign — but simply wasn't enough to convince conservative-leaning voters to put their personal dislike of bevin aside.
associated press gretchen whitmer, michigan's newly elected democratic governor, is urging the gop state legislature to roll back medicaid work requirements slated to take effect next year.
and then there is medicare ― yes, the same program that so many trump supporters cherish and that trump pledged, over and over again, never to touch.
a soccer player calls her opponents cowards and she is publicly rebuked and treated like a pariah. but if someone in trump world, say, scott baio, throws up a picture of hillary clinton with the word country partially blocked behind her so it looks like it says, c*nt) that's fair game.
contra gross' claims, sullivan's campaign points to other data suggesting he is a bridge builder. sullivan ranks as the 14th-most bipartisan member of the senate, according to the lugar center. he has worked with democrats on a bill aimed at reducing plastic waste in waterways, and been outspoken in his calls for greater action to resolve the plague of missing and murdered women in alaska native communities.
the 2017 law does modestly cut taxes for the lower and middle classes, but its main beneficiaries were the rich and corporations. and the law actually created more loopholes and tax breaks, experts say, favoring those who can afford pricey accounting help. ed kleinbard, former chief of congress' nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, which assesses tax legislation congress proposes, called the law a christmas present to the donor class and an abomination.
change the system: warren wants to fundamentally alter the rules of washington's power structure, weakening the influence lobbyists and corporations have over policy outcomes.
post-roe america will probably continue to be a checkerboard. it is conceivable, although probably unlikely, that congress could pass a nationwide ban. much more likely, each state will set its own rules. currently the center for reproductive rights considers 23 states at risk for banning abortion entirely, including four that have passed trigger bans designed to take effect immediately upon a reversal of roe.
if you no longer have a tax, why isn't it unconstitutional? judge jennifer elrod, who was appointed to the 5th circuit court of appeals by republican president georgew. bush, asked attorneys for the democratic officials defending the law during a hearing in new orleans.

none of us knows where mueller is going, when the investigation will end, what he will find or what impact it will have. we've viewed mueller with hopeful eyes, but we are now seeing a vigorous effort to destroy the probe, and none of us can be sure this effort won't be successful.
that's something that even barrett herself acknowledged in a 2013 talk at notre dame university when she said best way to prevent abortions would be through policies that support poor, single mothers.
though she targeted rural voters outside lexington, she also campaigned broadly as a progressive. she favors adding a public option to obamacare, lowering the age of eligibility for medicare and increasing federal funding for infrastructure and job programs in central kentucky. she is in favor of abortion rights, is pro–lgbtq equality and is vocally opposed to president donald trump's efforts to ban transgender troops from the military and bar refugees from majority-muslim nations from entering the country.
he urged the senate to reject this harmful legislation and start again on a health care bill that puts patients first.
in new york, an ad for republican rep. john faso features his wife, a cancer survivor, speaking directly to the camera. john knows firsthand how important health care is for families, she says. the truth is he voted to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. in florida, a video for fellow gop incumbent mario díaz-balart follows nearly the same script. his wife, recalling her own bout with cancer, calls attacks on her husband's health care record hurtful.
the current price controls are clearly not working, he said. getting away from price controls would probably improve the viability of the individual market.
pepin is one of 13 unusual counties in wisconsin that voted for trump and sen. ron johnson (r) in 2016; president barack obama in both 2008 and 2012; gov. scott walker (r) in 2010, 2012 and 2014; and baldwin in 2012. more than any other place in the state, they have gone back and forth between parties in recent years.
she and her allies have swamped arizona's airwaves with commercials emphasizing her new-found friendship, along with her military background and support for border security. her two opponents, meanwhile, have battled one another over the same slice of the gop electorate while trying in vain to win the president's attention.
still, the latest challenge to the law has advanced in the courts despite widespread derision from legal experts, including conservatives who helped construct and argue previous challenges to the aca.
president clinton ate the republicans' supper tuesday night, but house speaker newt gingrich and sen. bob dole wound up with heartburn, wrote chicago sun-times syndicated columnist carl rowan two days later.
whatever the regulation's true limits, it would likely have significant effects.
to all the people in new york and california, keep wasting your money, he said.
the idea of giving states a fixed amount of money and letting them decide what to do with it has been popular for quite some time with conservatives, including house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.). they argue that states know their own needs better than washington does.
the respondents to aarp's survey strongly believe in preserving medicaid funding at its current levels. seventy-three percent of all older voters, including 55 percent of trump voters, would like congress to keep funding for medicaid where it is now if obamacare is repealed, according to aarp.
if you open when cases are still increasing, as many states did, it's like leaning into a left hook: you're going to get hit hard, frieden said.
cooper said he sees only upsides for people of color in the trump tax cut law.
there is, of course, one policy promise that republicans take seriously, and its centrality to the repeal crusade becomes increasingly apparent as the debate goes on: the vow to roll back obamacare's taxes, particularly new payroll tax surcharges that fall exclusively on the wealthy. this is a straight-up, one-to-one transfer of money from low- and middle-class people (who lose health insurance) to the wealthy (who get a tax cut).
unlike hundreds of newspapers across the country that endorsed hillary clinton over donald trump in 2016 ― many of them with conservative editorial boards breaking ranks ― florida's naples daily news, which endorsed mitt romney in 2012, chose to offer no endorsement at all in the 2016 presidential race.
no, said the wwe spokesperson. now that it has come to our attention, sal siino is no longer an employee.
roberts's 2012 decision to uphold the law surprised many analysts, given his conservative credentials and past role as an official in republican administrations. one popular theory is that he thought overturning a program that mattered to so many people and invalidating the signature achievement of a democratic president would provoke a political backlash to the court and, perhaps, the republican party.
during the 2016 campaign, trump made vague, outlandish promises to concoct a plan that would cover every american at a lower cost. such a plan has never been seen. during the repeal push two years ago, trump's white house never even bothered coming up with its own proposal, leaving the task instead to congress, which similarly had no idea what it wanted to do, beyond repealing the dreaded obamacare and simply gutting the safety net, which has been the party's goal for several decades at least.
kavanaugh declined to say whether a president should be able to use his power to direct agencies to carry out directives for political purposes, an issue that arose earlier this week after trump suggested the department of justice lay off prosecuting a pair of house republicans ahead of the november midterm elections.
my friend, martha mcsally, she's the real deal, trump says in one of the ads. she's tough.
we don't oversee the executive, he added, earning a round of loud boos from the audience. congress is not the board of directors of the white house.
anthem, one of the aca's largest insurers and the sole option for many consumers in certain u.s. counties, is likely to pull out of many regional exchanges in 2018, leaving counties in colorado, kentucky, missouri, and ohio without any aca insurance plans or 2018.
transferring federal money to states may put elderly people and their families in a tough spot.
you can look at it as socialized medicine, rep. ted yoho (r-fla.) told huffpost on tuesday. but in the face of an outbreak, a pandemic, what's your options?
the progressive caucus co-chair agreed that pelosi seemed to be incorporating progressive values in the next bill. he thought some funding for the postal service and vote-by-mail would be included in the legislation, as well as hazard pay for essential workers such as doctors and nurses.
but the smaller repeal looks like it's in decent shape. fifty republicans voted to open debate tuesday, with only collins and murkowski voting no. and even though there are a number of republicans who could potentially vote against the skinny repeal ― ron johnson (r-wis.), mike lee (r-utah) and shelley moore capito (r-w.va.) among the most likely ― lawmakers have largely tipped their hand. they have shown willingness to cave to leadership. they don't seem that troubled by the process or the legislation that leadership is using to strike at the affordable care act. and their complaints of a bad process or a bad bill are just that: complaints.
mistakes in these choices are costly. so where can the average consumer turn to get unbiased advice, no matter what type of health insurance coverage they are considering? perhaps surprisingly, two of the best comparison sites are government sites to help make choices within their plans.
murtaugh repeated that he would defer to the white house on any announcement, then resumed attacking biden's policy proposals.
to cope with the hours, the emails, and the mind numbing dread of having to live in their parents' basements until they're thirty, the summer interns turned with enthusiasm to the vibrant nightlife that manhattan has to offer. after work, this freshly minted batch of legal drinkers flocked en masse to the city's rooftop lounges and sports bars, backpacks and tote bags in tow. they practically threw their ids at bouncers in their eagerness and pounded cocktails to blow off some steam. they jumped at the opportunity to flex their yopro muscles, bickering over who had it the toughest in the office and testing out versions of their elevator pitches on unwitting friends. impassioned by the heat and the frenzy of the crowds, some may have even indulged their remaining adolescent hormones and finished the night with a sweaty make out or - more likely - a flurry of incomprehensible, tipsy snapchats. twenty-five year olds who are comfortably settled into their first (or fourth) job may sneer, but to the young summer intern, it was all part of the allure of the city.
while the vote on the measure was destined to fail in the republican-controlled senate from the outset, it does allow democrats to put vulnerable republicans on the spot ahead of the 2020 election. the topic of health care and preexisting conditions, in particular, was a big issue during the 2018 midterm elections when democrats won the house.

on the democratic side in the michigan gubernatorial race, former michigan senate democratic leader gretchen whitmer is the front-runner. abdul el-sayed, detroit's former health director, is a progressive favorite and has been compared with former president barack obama for his eloquence in speeches. if elected, el-sayed would be the country's first muslim governor.
sending unpaid bills to a collection agency or pursuing a civil claim is a last resort, said uva health system spokesman eric swensen. two years ago, he said, the health system limited lawsuits to cases in which patients owe more than $1,000. for the vast majority of patients, we are able to agree upon workable payment plans without filing a legal claim, he said.
i have wondered, as we have seen men halted in their tracks upon accusations of sexual violence in some form, why has this not happened with systemic racism in the 400 years that black folks have been in america, given how much nonstop violence and harassment we have faced? why has there never, like never, been the same massive reaction, the same challenges where the guilty or the accused have been forced to come clean, to resign, to leave careers behind, in the wake of their racist abuse of us?
medicaid eligibility is based on an applicant's income the month she applies, but the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits that congress approved last month won't count toward eligibility, and neither will the $1,200 tax credit most americans should receive this year as part of that stimulus law.
gross plans to caucus with democrats because he wants to pursue progressive changes in health care that build on the affordable care act's expansion of coverage, pass legislation curbing greenhouse gas emissions and protect women's reproductive rights.
or else a government-run single payer system – such as is in place in almost every other advanced economy – dedicated to lower premiums and better care for everyone.
meghan mccain was hoping to burn inslee about the green new deal, but instead the plan backfired when she attempted to use ridiculous talking points like the one promoted at the past weekend's cpac conference that the plan will supposedly take away hamburgers.
though there is deep affection for biden among obama's team, many privately question his skills as a campaigner and fear a losing run will damage his reputation as a beloved elder statesman. some democratic voters share that concern.
oh, this is really happening, he recalled. i felt like benedict, for one, was thrown under the bus, because that's not how it was supposed to happen. but it felt a little disrespectful, the way that he just came and did it.
we are at a time when states are enacting these laws all over our country designed to disenfranchise voters, as one federal court said about a south carolina law, 'targeting them with almost surgical precision to disenfranchise them,' booker said toward the end of his time. and now we don't even have the voting rights act designed to curtail discriminatory laws before they go into effect. your answers don't provide me comfort.
since october, when trump signed an executive order calling on the labor department to develop new rules for ahps, an array of experts and health care groups have warned about the potential to divide insurance markets between healthy and sick ― and to leave patients more exposed to crippling medical bills. on thursday, those warnings were reiterated.
though the terms are not yet final, one eu diplomat told cnn friday that it was very unlikely travelers from the u.s. would be allowed in when the bloc reopens, adding that the u.s.'s chances are close to zero.
many observers interpreted pence's remarks as an effort to refocus voters on the courts. recent polls indicate widespread disapproval of trump's handling of the covid-19 crisis, but his conservative overhaul of the federal judiciary has been touted by his supporters as an enduring achievement.
no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom. in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids. scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years. together, we will defeat aids in america.
but the justice department lawyers thought of that. they asked the federal judge in texas hearing the case to hold off on wrecking the insurance market until january ― a couple of months after the midterm elections.
it's yet another case of republicans trying to disguise the very real trade-offs of their effort to repeal the affordable care act.
and in a matter of days a lunatic shot up a colorado planned parenthood using her language.
veterans service organizations have long championed the preservation of the va, and make compelling arguments why it should remain intact. the main fear is that privatization lowers the quality of health care for veterans. they cite multiple studies showing va health care outperform the private sector in quality of care.
the challenge to obamacare that's before the courts now doesn't simply threaten some provisions like its protections for those with preexisting conditions. it would eliminate all of the law ― including its expansion of medicaid that has benefited millions of people across the country.
others likened the two health care plans to the original star wars movies versus its spin-offs, and professional cakes as opposed to homemade ones.
the center's plan has other provisions ― including a call to limit payments to the providers and producers of health care ― that would ultimately raise some of the same questions sanders plan did during the campaign.
if this, indeed, turns out to be an effort at sabotaging the aca, it would hardly be the first time.
the vow came during the second and final 2020 presidential debate, which was held in nashville, tennessee. moderator kristen welker, from msnbc, asked trump how he would respond if the supreme court strikes down the affordable care act, taking coverage away from an estimated 21 million people and throwing the health care system into chaos.
(ap photo/hans pennink) new york assemblywoman maritza davila, center, urges state senators to pass the green light bill granting undocumented immigrants access to driver's licenses, during a june 17 rally in albany, n.y. despite hesitation from some democrats, the bill passed and was signed the next day.
i don't know anybody in the infrastructure business that thinks that tax advantage for equity and public-private partnership deals are what's going to fix the problem, warner added.
but this year, the 55-year-old decided not to buy health insurance for the first time since obamacare. it's not so much that kenny has soured on the aca, he said. his reasons are different: rising premiums, fewer choices and a surprise bill he received all compelled him to bow out.
many of the people who lost policies ultimately got cheaper ones because they were eligible for the law's tax credits. and even those who paid more were getting coverage with new protections, not realizing their old policies had limits that would have left them with ruinous expenses if a serious illness or injury occurred.

the urban institute projects that 20 million people would lose health coverage under such a decision, which would end the law's medicaid expansion to poor adults and its subsidies on private health insurance for low- and middle-income families.
and it's not just lawyers urging the courts to reject this case.
sen. elizabeth warren (mass.) acknowledged as much in her response to a question about health care on wednesday: i'm with bernie on medicare for all, she said.
you will report to: 700,000 people from your area, the congressional leaders of your party, committee chairs who will decide if you get to do anything, outside groups looking to influence you, lobbyists who will only give you money -- or, at least, more money -- if you vote the right way, and a malleable conscience that can somehow rationalize the periodic abandonment of your principles to stay in office.
it's just staggering, said hogue. all of the polling since kavanaugh has shown just how dear roe is to americans across the spectrum. you've got a president embroiled in potentially criminal conspiracy charges who picked a guy off of a list compiled by the federalist society who has already called roe rotten precedent. that's everything you need to win.
the bill is also a disappointment for many progressives on another key piece of getting the economy up and running again: child care. advocates and some lawmakers were looking for an additional $50 billion to stabilize child care providers, many of whom are struggling to survive amid closures. the bill released tuesday would provide just $7 billion.
the hearing room was a bit quieter this morning as members of the public were kept out for over 30 minutes. it's not clear what happened, but seats for the public were left open, and people were unable to get in. but around 10:45 a.m., tickets were given to people standing in line once again and they were allowed in 23 people at a time. so the block was just temporary.
a: it's the surest way to make sure everybody has insurance, since the government just signs up everybody ― and anybody who might miss out gets insured the moment they interact with the health care system, whether it's at the emergency room or a pharmacy. the benefits are so comprehensive that nobody would struggle with medical bills.
as we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
i was able to vote because i had my military id. my voter registration id did not come until after the election, she said. it's a big reason why she leads voter registration drives and town halls on candidates and issues to help students stay politically engaged on campus.

in january, the 83-year-old hatch announced he would retire from the senate at the end of 2018. he has served in the office since 1977.
although chip had bipartisan support, congress had failed to renew it. part of the reason is that there were disagreements over how to pay for it, with some gop proposals undercutting obamacare in the process.
lipinski's voting record used to have a solid home in his part of illinois, a historically more conservative region than much of the rest of the chicago area. he won his house seat in 2004, taking it over from his father, who had represented the district for 22 years.
barr reported in his letter that mueller had found no evidence of collusion between the 2016 trump campaign and russia. the attorney general also concluded himself that trump did not obstruct justice in mueller's investigation, a conclusion democrats say he should explain in testimony before congress.

the narrator notes how biden, during former president barack obama's administration, stood on the world stage and helped make obamacare the law of the land, and declares he can step in on day one.
ever since his days as a presidential candidate, trump has been promising a health care plan. the budget repeats that promise but offers few details. it lays out a health reform vision that calls for better care at lower cost and protecting people with preexisting medical conditions.
amanda terkel sen. tammy baldwin (d-wis.) met with dairy farmers in altoona, wis.
health insurance plans intended to cover gaps in coverage ― for example, when you start a new job but your health benefits don't kick in right away ― have been around for a long time. most of the affordable care act's rules about benefits don't apply to them, and they don't have to cover pre-existing conditions. typically, these policies had to be short-term, lasting only a few months. so the trump administration came up with an idea: let the bare-bones plans cover 364 days, essentially making them an alternative to yearlong policies.
watch the rachel maddow clip above.
we put them in office, she said. we have the power.
the crowd chanted in unison, how can the poor get savings accounts?
in contrast, trump knows that south carolina conservatives, like conservatives in other states, are open to populism. among evangelicals, trump showed in iowa he could be competitive. and the military voters are attracted to trump's i'm the most militaristic who will make the military so strong no one will mess with us. against that, jeb's people are looking at me because they want a guy who can be the commander-in-chief is unconvincing. trump knows that many national security voters doubted the iraq war or questioned how it was fought.
and these plans are designed to attract healthy consumers, so the more of them that leave the affordable care act exchanges to join association health plans, the more costly the exchange customer base becomes and the higher premiums for those customers will be.
organization for economic cooperation and development while unemployment remained relatively stable in europe and japan during the pandemic, it skyrocketed in the united states, which is represented by the purple trend line above.
over the past 20 years, the district has moved, goldstein said. it has moved to a district that would like a pro-choice representative, it has moved to a district that would like someone who supports 'medicare for all,' and is looking for health care expansion. it is a district that is directly impacted by the climate crisis and is looking for someone who understands the urgency of that issue. on almost every issue that matters to folks in this district, stephen lynch is to the right of where the district is.
there is, however, one very simple ― and highly unlikely ― solution to the repeal of the aca tanking early retirement: require that private companies provide retiree health benefit plans, as they once did.
in order to actually be for us and with us, you have to be among us, he said about steyer's campaigning efforts in black communities. the places that you need to go is the 'hood. walk the streets, see what the people like, see what the people need. and those are the things that i feel that he really wasn't doing.
what in the hell do you mean by that? king asked, adding that jorjani's comment implies a disrespect for the watchdog office.
washington governor jay inslee appeared on the view monday to discuss his 2020 presidential run, which is centered on climate change.
it's actually the strategy gop leaders originally planned to pursue following the november election. they ditched that plan in january, very much with trump's support, partly in response to objections from their own members who were nervous about voting to take insurance away from many millions of people with no guarantee of what coverage, if any, those people would get instead.
mccain then tried to get inslee in a gotcha moment with, again, talking points spouted by people who oppose the plan but aren't actually in the plan.
lawmakers in colorado passed equal pay legislation in late may, compensating employees who are underpaid as a result of their gender when they win a civil suit confirming it. the law kicks in on jan. 1, 2021.
and then, turning more serious, he noted that employer coverage isn't nearly as stable as defenders make it out to be, with insurers constantly changing provider networks, employers constantly switching carriers, and workers constantly losing employment altogether.
cap's plan envisions a public insurance program that looks vaguely like medicare but with a more generous benefit structure. (medicare doesn't have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses, for example.) the new program would eventually absorb, through some kind of automatic enrollment, all americans who have no insurance, are in medicaid or buy private coverage on their own through healthcare.gov or directly from insurers.
that doesn't mean the law has worked well for everybody, or that some people don't feel much worse off. the tax credits taper off as income grows, so people making more than four times the poverty line (that's about $100,000 a year for a family of four) get no credits at all.
the problem, many scholars have noted, is that congress has taken action since it passed the affordable care act. specifically, it left pre-existing protections in place even as it reduced the individual mandate penalty to zero. regardless of whether that was a smart policy move, it is clearly what congress intended ― and congress gets to make those kinds of decisions.
insurers today cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of health status, as long as people sign up during annual open enrollment or qualify for an exemption for a reason like a move or a new job. but under this proposal, insurers could increase premiums by 30 percent, for up to a year, on people who do not maintain continuous coverage, meaning that they let their coverage lapse for more than two months. this would have the biggest effect on lower-income people and people juggling jobs ― particularly because, under the gop proposal, they would be getting less financial aid from the government.
for decades, republicans have favored expanding association health plans, largely because these plans don't have to follow important state insurance laws, like those that require specific services to be covered.
ryan, among others, keeps suggesting that trump will make it all happen. but obama could successfully rally democrats partly because he had been engaged on the issue, directly and substantively, throughout his presidency. in early 2010, when the bill was in its greatest political peril, obama famously held forth on the plan details ― jousting with republicans at a january 2010 party retreat in baltimore and then in a february marathon bipartisan open meeting at blair house, near the white house.
in some states where clinics are sparse and far between, technology can close the distance. telemedicine — discussions between doctor and patient via computer — is often used for the counseling part of the process. but states with the strictest abortion laws may ban that practice.
during the recent republican attempt to repeal and replace obamacare, which fortunately went down in defeat, there was much talk about the 24 million people who would lose their health insurance if trumpcare became the law of the land.
there has to be that radical revolution in this nation, where people come first, not power and privilege.
so kavanaugh's confirmation is gonna come down to two gop senators, collins and murkowski, and a handful of red-state dems.
it's aca, not obamacare, and without it, i would not have health insurance. i am so grateful i have it. — hairball is in the room where it happened 🆘🌊 (@orangepeel18) june 28, 2020
there is no argument that the aca has lowered the number of people who do not have health insurance. allowing young adults to stay on their parents insurance policy until they are 26, increasing the number of people eligible for medicaid, and the individual mandate requiring health insurance or paying a tax (penalty), have all contributed to lowering the number of uninsured from 49 million people in 2010 to 29 million in 2015. some argue that the improving economy has also had a role in allowing more to afford health insurance, but, clearly, the aca is helping in this regard.
this can be a lifeline, pollitz said.
but the studies sanders has in mind typically assume that providers of health care would see substantial reductions in their revenue over time. that wouldn't simply mean paying a lot less to drug companies and insurers, whom sanders loves to attack. it would also mean paying a lot less to doctors and hospitals, whom sanders loves to champion as heroes ― and whom he mentioned no less than a half dozen times on wednesday as allies in his fight.
medicare for all proponents view the reticence of the candidates who haven't joined their side as a lack of courage. they also learned from the gop's relentless attacks on the affordable care act that even incremental change will bring accusations of rampant socialism, so they might as well go for the whole thing.
then nothing more from him, but that didn't bother me for two reasons. if i'd learned anything from online dating over the past 10 years, it was to not take anything personally. and secondly, i was getting plenty of other messages.
with the republicans' obamacare replacement bill on life support last friday morning, trump tried to shame the freedom caucus on twitter into getting on board with it by appealing to their anti-abortion views. the group of lawmakers, trump alleged, would allow [planned parenthood] to continue if they stop this plan!
democrats and advocates fear the conservative appellate judge, who was nominated to the high court by president donald trump, will overturn obamacare's pre-existing condition protections, taking the country back to a time when insurance companies could deny consumers coverage. trump pushed for legislation last year in congress that would have repealed the law, but the measure was narrowly defeated.
former vice president joe biden is waging a two-front fight on health care reform by vowing in his latest presidential campaign proposal to protect the affordable care act from republicans and democrats alike.
but a funny thing happened on the way to the governor's office: bevin's anti-obamacare rhetoric started to tone down as election day approached. and in the months since he's been chief executive of kentucky, instead of ripping up obamacare out of his state, bevin is making alterations to how the law works there and leaving its core elements and benefits in place.
experts have long debated the appropriateness of the official poverty threshold, with many favoring an alternate poverty measure that the census bureau produces alongside the official one. the alternate measure takes into account more sources of income, expenses and geographical price differences than the official measure. (experts say its benefit is as a descriptive tool, not as a replacement of the regular threshold for program eligibility.)
most coverage of ky medicaid waiver focuses on work req. but just as important are multiple lockouts if you don't pay your premium, report a change in income, or miss a paperwork deadline you are forced to be uninsured for 6 months. too high a price to pay. — joan alker (@joanalker1) january 12, 2018
as she talked to people during the campaign ― and if you've been on the trail with her, you know she listens as much as she talks ― and consulted with health experts, she identified ways to make it better and more responsive to concerns and anxieties she's heard, the official said.
thursday could be a turning point for the vote. if the number of moderates with reservations about repealing reaches a critical mass, conservatives who are undecided or leaning against the bill might come out against it. if moderates get on board, conservatives might decide to go along on friday as well.
if private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better, this public plan will create a natural glide-path to medicare for all, the document says. it gives the american people a choice and trusts them to set the pace at which our country moves in a better direction on health care.

. janesville, where he was born, had a population of 63,000 in 2013; the legions of the newly uninsured would populate this small city, and also his college alma mater, miami university in ohio, hundreds of times over. 14 million is about six times the population of houston , slightly less than ten times the size of phoenix , and over sixteen times the size of columbus, ohio (whose citizens might want to pick up the phone and call their members of congress immediately to oppose the republican plan).
during his speech, trump also paused for applause for one of his guests, ryan holets, an albuquerque, new mexico, police officer who, along with this wife, adopted a baby from a pregnant homeless mother struggling with opioid addiction. their baby girl, hope, now 3 months old, was also in attendance.
insurance under these circumstances can be very expensive or flat-out unaffordable for some people at higher-middle incomes, especially those in their 50s or early 60s who are charged higher rates.
in april 1973, just months after the roe decision, a woman named geri santoro became the symbol of the pre-roe world. ms. magazine published a nine-year-old crime scene photo of santoro, dead on a motel room floor, naked with a towel between her legs, kneeling in a pool of her own blood.
she and her husband, tracy, had assumed the bills would be not be a problem. they are members of medi-share, one of a handful of nonprofit christian sharing ministries whose popularity has exploded in the last few years. like the other ministries, medi-share, based in florida, promotes itself as an affordable, spiritually oriented way to pay for health care. the lammers had joined about a year and a half earlier, after danielle lost her job at a large firm in a round of layoffs and took a position at a small business that doesn't provide benefits. tracy, who is 44 and manages a trailer repair shop, also can't get coverage through work.
a fourth, newly announced speaker on health care is activist ady barkan. barkan, who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ― commonly known as lou gehrig's disease ― endorsed sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts in this year's democratic presidential race and is perhaps best known as an advocate of medicare for all. biden has pointedly declined to support that idea, which envisions a single government plan providing insurance for all americans. instead, the soon-to-be official nominee has called for creating a public program that would be open to all but purely voluntary.

viewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. but he brought people and their different interests together. his moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust. criticism on the right ― from insiders and outsiders ― was swift.
even though the barr letter left trump critics deflated this week, the justice department's new stance on wiping out the entirety of obamacare had democrats licking their chops about an issue that had helped them win control of the house of representatives last november.
but five years later, trump and his gop allies reduced the mandate penalty to zero, effectively eliminating it, as part of their 2017 tax cut legislation. that action has thrown the affordable care act back into constitutional jeopardy ― or so the plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit suggest.
eligibility for subsidies is based on projected annual income, not current monthly income like medicaid and chip. unemployed workers must account for their earnings prior to their job losses, along with their unemployment insurance payments. the $600 weekly unemployment boost also counts toward this total, but the $1,200 tax rebate doesn't.
associated press the last time national regulation of hospital prices got serious consideration was during the late 1970s, when president jimmy carter proposed it. that effort died in the face of industry opposition.
under the affordable care act, all private plans must cover a variety of benefits, including hospitalizations, prescription drugs, contraception, mental health and maternity. under the house gop bill, states would be permitted to establish whatever essential benefits they wanted, and leave out the rest.
when president obama nominated merrick garland to the supreme court, mitch mcconnell didn't even let him have a hearing, reads one of the dozens of mcconnell-centric facebook ads the dscc is running. now that donald trump is in power, mitch mcconnell is going nuclear by changing the rules to pack our courts with extreme right-wing judges like neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh on the bench instead.
tweaking graham for essentially campaigning on fox news has also become a regular feature in his stump speech.
the affordable care act's guarantee that people with preexisting conditions can get coverage would go away. rules requiring insurance companies to cover the essential health benefits defined by the law, including prescription drugs, hospital care and preventive medicine, would disappear. without the affordable care act, insurers also could resume setting dollar limits on annual and lifetime medical care for each policyholder. medicare beneficiaries would pay more for prescriptions because they would lose additional assistance provided by obamacare.
in theory, the existence of a new, more attractive insurance option might persuade some employers to stop offering coverage altogether. but few experts think employers will be rushing to drop coverage, no matter how generous biden and his allies manage to make assistance inside the exchanges.
question #4: if hillary fans are so willing to support bernie if he's the democratic nominee, how come so many bernie fans (like susan sarandon) dare to say that they won't do the same for hillary?

unless a court challenge gets in the way, nothing will stop the farm bureau and wellmark from jacking up premiums on people with conditions such as cancer and diabetes ― or denying those people coverage altogether. nor will anything keep the plan sponsors from limiting or excluding benefits the affordable care act considers essential, a list that includes treatment for mental illness, maternity care and prescription drugs.
even republican senators are dismissing the lawsuit as without basis, although one of them, ted cruz from texas, recently told vox's dylan scott he thought that declining to defend the affordable care act in court was reasonable.
indeed, tipirneni has focused on the kitchen-table issues of health care, education and retirement security.
the lawsuit, brought by 20 states led by republicans, argues that the law's protections were supposed to work in tandem with the mandate that individuals have health insurance. because congress is no longer enforcing the mandate, they say, insurers no longer have to sell policies to everyone regardless of medical status.
biden's plan: making the affordable care act more affordable

this could potentially leave millions of americans without coverage that could help them get the care they need, like therapy, for mental health issues.
federal courts have thwarted the work requirements, saying the administration has clearly strayed from the purpose of the medicaid program, which is to give poor people health care, not make them get jobs.
tension boiled over in a meeting between top administration officials ― including top strategist steve bannon and chief of staff reince priebus ― and republican lawmakers hours after house leadership delayed a scheduled vote on their health care legislation thursday. president donald trump, according to office of management and budget director mick mulvaney, is done negotiating, and house republicans are scheduled to vote friday. if the vote fails, mulvaney said, the president was prepared to leave obamacare in place.
i still like joe, he said.
in the last 2 years, our brave ice officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.
republicans have at various times promised that their proposal would provide better, cheaper insurance than the affordable care act ― and that people who now depend on the law for coverage won't be left in the lurch. but they have also promised to reduce spending and regulations ― and to get rid of the law's highly unpopular individual mandate, which is a financial penalty for people who decline to get coverage even when it wouldn't cause hardship.
people who already have serious medical problems would face a more straightforward challenge. chances are they couldn't even buy a farm bureau policy. at best, they would have to pay a great deal more or accept a rider that excluded treatments for whatever conditions they already had.
rebecca lambe, the senior democratic strategist widely credited with engineering electoral success in nevada under former sen. harry reid, said the problem for heller is that while voters still see trump as someone they sent to washington to shake up the system, heller is part of that system.
correction: an earlier version of this story misstated that trump had not previously blamed members of the house freedom caucus in public for the gop health care bill's demise.
the entire basis for this lawsuit would vanish if congress simply repealed the language in the aca about the mandate. that's it. no one will miss the mandate, which is toothless without the fines anyway. plus, people hated it and, despite a broad consensus in 2010, it turned out not to be very effective anyway.
this is, perhaps, the biggest disconnect between trump's voters and the people in whom they've placed their trust. republican legislators are hoping to get a quick repeal and to buy some time to come up with a palatable plan ― but there's never been any indication that they can stomach actually creating a plan that's truly in line with what their constituents want. trump sees a looming political trap and wants there to be a period of inertia so that democrats end up taking the blame for entropy in the affordable care act's marketplace ― which is probably what a republican-controlled congress would have done if hillary clinton had won the election.

we must defend the aca from trump's assault and protect people's existing coverage. however, protecting the aca will not fully solve the health care crisis. to finally guarantee health care as a right, we must take on the insurance industry and pass a medicare for all bill, sanders wrote on twitter tuesday.

but now that it's president donald trump's administration chaffetz is charged with monitoring, he's willing to sit back and wait.
and for good measure, trump questions the faith of ted cruz. it is hard to believe that a person who claims to be a christian could be so dishonest and lie so much, said trump, who said he would sue cruz about his canadian birth unless he takes down his false ads and retract his lies. trump sees cruz as his immediate threat, just as he did in iowa. that's why he let cruz and rubio fight it out in the debate, and why he goes after cruz so intently.

donnelly said braun is focused on his past stock ownership because he's afraid to fight over health care and other domestic policies. it's what a desperate candidate does when they have nothing else to talk about.
the affordable care act also called for adjustments in payments to hospitals and insurance companies that offer alternative coverage within medicare. experts who have looked at the lawsuit have said they are not even sure how the federal government would go about undoing those kinds of changes.
biden's political nature is more centrist and cautious than that of his most progressive presidential rivals like sanders and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.). and he's angling to win by appealing to democratic voters who are uneasy with the progressive turn the party has taken since losing the 2016 presidential election, which includes older voters.
but even worse than the spectacle of our head of state compulsively confessing to obstruction of justice is trump's refusal to take seriously or act on the continuing threat of russian interference in our democracy. likely because trump sees evidence of russian manipulation of the 2016 election as a threat to his presidential manhood, cnn reports that trump's own advisers are struggling to convince him that russia still poses a threat. trump has done nothing publicly to punish or deter russia regarding election interference, and, according to cnn, multiple senior administration officials said there are few signs the president is devoting his time or attention to the ongoing election-related cyber threat from russia.
the commission also identifies the white house office of national drug control policy as a key player in the battle against the opioid epidemic. but it's not clear the trump administration agrees. the president has yet to nominate a full-time drug czar to lead the ondcp, and a 24-year-old former campaign staffer had reportedly been running many of the agency's operations until earlier this month, when he announced plans to step aside amid scrutiny of his work history and résumé. trump has also reportedly floated the possibility of slashing ondcp's budget by 95 percent and shifting its key responsibilities to other departments.
overall, the number of people without any kind of health insurance will be 3 million higher as a result of the recent legal and regulatory changes to the health care law, the congressional budget office has predicted. but that number actually understates the decline in coverage, since some of the insured will be in plans without key benefits. in other words, they will be what many experts consider under-insured.
chris sloan of the consulting firm avalere health says it's likely that many who became unemployed in the pandemic had no job-based health insurance to begin with. that means they represent the demographic for which the health law was originally designed.

in colorado, lawmakers passed a framework for public health insurance for residents in rural counties and bills designed to address the opioid crisis.
many americans ― quite possibly most ― would have no problem linking medicaid and work. but nearly 80 percent of people on medicaid are already in families where somebody is employed, and nearly 60 percent work themselves, according to data from the henry j. kaiser family foundation. and of those who don't work, most are in school or caring for a family member, or have a medical condition that they say prevents them from working. other studies have yielded similar findings.
cornyn can't have it both ways, rahman said in a statement. the question now becomes, where does cornyn stand on the paxton lawsuit to repeal affordable care for texans who have recently lost their job?
meanwhile, the more reckless trump continues to roll back progress in numerous areas and take the country in directions internationally that will be hard for democrats with control of one congressional chamber to steer back from. and while he and his legal team have gone into overdrive trying to attack the credibility of the mueller investigation, trump is pardoning corrupt politicians and pundits, sending the message to witnesses in the russia probe ― and to his former lawyer michael cohen ― that he will pardon them in return for protecting him. he's also sending the message to the rest of us that he will crush any investigations and erase any convictions of his cronies.

mcgrath's victory is the latest in a string of wins for democratic establishment leaders, whose preferred candidates have repeatedly held off progressive insurgents like booker in the 2020 election cycle. but the results also demonstrate the first major challenge facing mcgrath in november: she lost kentucky's two largest counties and will need to reenergize voters who preferred booker in both locations to have any shot at ousting mcconnell this fall.
uncertainty over the future of the affordable care act ― and, in particular, the administration's willingness to manage the program ― has spooked insurers, causing them to seek higher premium increases next year and in some cases withdraw from markets altogether.
things would be a lot worse without the affordable care act, which republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal. whatever the law's shortcomings, obamacare has improved access to care, prevented financial hardship from medical bills and reduced mortality, according to the best available research.
washington -- the supreme court has taken four big whacks at the affordable care act in as many years. but the conservative justices still don't seem to understand how it works.
the rhetorical flourish was the culmination of a campaign in which trump took pleasure in shredding the tenets of the wealthy-first, trickle-down economics that have dominated the gop since ronald reagan's presidency.
lots of left-leaning berners don't think hillary is progressive enough, is essentially a lite republican, and is at least partially responsible (along with her husband) for selling out progressive ideals. right-leaning berners probably don't like or trust hillary at all. and nearly all berners see hillary clinton as yet another embodiment of the rigged-for-the-rich economic/political system bernie sanders has raged against as his #1 campaign issue. conversely, hillary fans aren't angry at bernie because he's a true progressive and is their second choice for achieving most hillary supporters' #1 priority -- defeating trump and the republicans.
sometimes it helps to remember what health care looked like before the affordable care act, and how much people with serious medical problems struggled if they had to buy coverage on their own rather than through employers.
why are you so obsessed with me, mr. president? biden's campaign tweeted alongside the video, which garnered more than half a million views in its first 12 hours online.
washington ― you would think that obamacare had enough real problems that republican presidential nominee donald trump would be able to stick to discussing them when taking a swing at the health care law. but you'd be wrong.
those who do find an appropriate space often don't receive the time they need to fully empty their breasts. a mcdonald's worker was yelled at and ordered to return to work before she was done pumping. a family dollar worker asked for more time to pump and got demoted to part-time. a spa employee was required to sign a piece of paper agreeing that she wouldn't take any more breaks. her inability to pump caused her to leak milk from her breasts while she worked.

studies from places that have banned or limited abortion show that women who want medication abortions will find ways to have them. in texas, for instance, where the number of clinics went from 41 in 2013 to 18 in 2016, grossman and his colleagues at the texas policy evaluation project at the university of texas at austin studied 18 women who self-induced abortion. because they could not afford the cost of or travel time to a clinic, they purchased pills either over the internet or over the counter in mexico.
biden wants to build upon the affordable care act by making its financial assistance more generous, creating a public plan that would be available to anybody, and by getting government more involved in the pricing of prescription drugs. millions would get relief, and they probably could get it quickly, since a democratic congress could swiftly pass at least part of the proposal.
but a medicare for all system, like any complex policy enterprise, would entail difficult trade-offs. at some point advocates need to figure out how they want to handle those, how they'll overcome the inevitable political resistance to what they decide and which parts of their vision matter to them most.
carilion clinic, by contrast, provides aid to families with income up to 400% of poverty guidelines and assets of less than $100,000, other than a house. if bills at riverside health exceed household income over 12 months, the hospital forgives the whole amount.
in key respects, this shouldn't be surprising, and reflects the dire need for health care access that persisted in the pre-obamacare health care system.
but some iowans have pre-existing conditions, which means they won't be able to buy the new plans. others will sign up for a farm bureau-wellmark policy, get sick and then require care that's beyond what the plans cover. they will be in trouble.

fox business praised the new company as nothing short of revolutionary, while bloomberg enthused it had the potential for disrupting the broader industry. cnbc predicted the group could succeed where insurers and government have failed. others pointedly interpreted the joint venture as a free market counterpunch to the government's overreach in the sector, symbolized most recently by obamacare, a target for hatred by conservatives. it shows how health care reform should work in this country, investor's business daily editorialized. you don't need government calling the shots to bring meaningful reforms.
obama has also required federal contractors to provide paid sick days to their employees, which parents can use to care for children or other loved ones in need. he's also emphasized these policies at the state and municipal level: currently, five states and 26 cities have paid sick time policies in place.
cms is clearly at pains to provide assurances of its benign intent in this maintenance schedule, eliot fishman, senior director of health policy at the health advocacy group families usa, told the hill. but with the president continuing to regularly brag about gutting the aca and with the administration refusing to defend the law in court, there is reason to be concerned about a schedule that takes the federal marketplace down for long stretches over weekends during holiday season. we'll be watching this closely.
monday is the affordable care act's 10th anniversary and two of its architects, former president barack obama and house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), had originally planned to mark the occasion by attending a special event at american university in washington, d.c.

i used to talk to her a lot before she got dementia, and she used to tell me all the time, that was the one thing she always wanted me to do, was to vote, said jones, who works as a prevention specialist at can community health. no matter what's going on in life, you make time to vote. so if you got to leave your job to vote, you do it. if you get fired, you just get fired. those were her exact words.
republicans are having a hard time defending the way their health care plan would weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. they got no help on sunday from one of their own, ohio gov. john kasich.
the legal arguments are also taking place in a political environment. democrats are eager to remind voters that trump has repeatedly tried to repeal or undermine the affordable care act, including its expansion of health insurance coverage and new protections for people with pre-existing conditions. on friday, becerra made that link explicit.
unfortunately, right now, the government, our health care system and our society in general are not focusing enough on putting resources into increasing prep uptake among black folks—it's clear, says ashwini hardikar, mph, director of prevention and outreach at the lgbt-focused callen-lorde community health center in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan.
i think all i can say, senator, is that was my view in 1998, the nominee said.
it's difficult to exaggerate what a final ruling against the affordable care act would mean, and not just for politics. nearly 10 years after enactment and more than four years into full implementation, the affordable care act has touched nearly the entire health care system.
i shared many progressives' suspicions about the strategy and motivation undergirding a group whose three principles included a rule that affordable health care policies must be fiscally responsible and win the political support needed to ensure long-term stability.
mcsweeny, who worked for biden from 2005 through 2012, said that was typical of his approach to governing, which she summed up using one of biden's favorite phrases: never die on a small cross.
protections for pre-existing conditions are the law.
president donald trump announced barrett's nomination on saturday. with a quick senate confirmation, she could be on the bench nov. 10, when the court plans to hear california v. texas, a lawsuit calling on the justices to wipe the affordable care act off the books.
but trump's vow makes a ton of sense as politics.
biden managed to fend off more moderate and center-left candidates on wednesday, escaping mostly unscathed. the big question, however, is how he stands up to progressive sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.), whom he will face at the next debate, in september.
now it's biden with a new health plan that, by design, leaves most existing insurance arrangements in place. his proposal would reinforce and expand existing programs, in part by making the assistance available through healthcare.gov and similar state-run exchanges more generous and available to people of all incomes, though still on a sliding scale.
mccaskill happens to be right. ripping the guts out of the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, and putting a new coverage system in place would be every bit as consequential as she described. health care really does account for one-sixth of the u.s. economy.
pence, who has no previous political experience, beat out four other republican candidates in the primary race. he raised nearly $1.2 million in campaign funds, according to federal election commission records, dwarfing his competitors.
allowing new parents time off to bond with their child also benefits the companies they work for. research shows that individuals given paid maternity leave are more likely to return to work at the same company, reducing costs associated with employee turnover. women who take paid leave are also more likely to work more hours and remain in the workforce longer.
icer's process first assesses how well a drug works, the side effects it produces, and how it compares to similar drugs and treatments. only after this analysis does icer look at cost. will a medication reduce future costs by keeping you healthier? does it offer benefits that no other medication on the market can? or will it lead to escalating and unsustainable costs for you and for the entire health care system to the point where no one will be available to afford the innovative treatment? for example, icer recently issued a report that concluded that entresto™ does offer excellent long term value to treat patients with congestive heart failure. some payers were concerned that the drug was too expensive and so were hesitant to approve it. the icer report found that its price, when normal discounts were factored in, represented a good value. this report increased the likelihood that patients who might benefit from the drug will have it covered by their insurance.
at a second town hall meeting later in the day, reed said americans would get tax credits to pay for health insurance, according to the buffalo news. when the audience asked how those credits would be used, reed replied, that is something we're still working on.
sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.), another vulnerable member, also said congress needed to come up with a replacement to obamacare and its protections for pre-existing conditions. but the north carolina republican brushed off political ramifications about the trump administration's new position regarding the lawsuit, telling reporters on tuesday he was not concerned about coming democratic attacks.
and even though the sponsor of the medicare for all bill, rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), said she was not happy, obviously, she praised pelosi's support for hearings on the legislation.
kendall, a self-described moderate republican, has been unimpressed with gross' ads highlighting his marksmanship.
and on monday night, republicans flew in trump himself to make the case for bevin. (if you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. and if you lose, they are going to say trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. you can't let that happen to me! trump declared.)
democrats say judge brett kavanaugh, president donald trump's nominee to the supreme court, should answer questions about his views on decisions like roe v. wade because he has questioned whether several high court rulings were properly decided.
the proposed plan by the senate republicans threatens the coverage that now exists for those with mental illness, including children and veterans.
that estimate, from standard & poors, is crude and tentative. but future evaluations of the gop proposal's likely effects, including the official projection from the congressional budget office, are likely to reach a similar conclusion.
republicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace obamacare, a top campaign promise of president donald trump. instead, the trump administration has sought to weaken the program through executive orders and administrative rules.
republic report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of president donald j. trump. trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.
texas and four other states sued the obama administration on tuesday over extending its healthcare nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals, saying the move represents a radical invasion of the federal bureaucracy into a doctor's medical judgment.
kasich said that as governor he would not opt for the waiver from obamacare's pre-existing conditions provisions.
democrats have a pretty clear idea of how they want to improve the health care system, and the split within that party is between those who want to government to cover everybody and those who want the government to just cover more people than it does now.
considering his experience as obama's vice president, biden should be aware of these changes. while he did managed to broker a deal with mcconnell to avoid the fiscal cliff, the deal was blasted by progressives and despised by then-senate minority leader harry reid. the rest of his time as vice president was largely defined by uniform gop opposition.
these fresh-faced, slightly nervous, over-caffeinated young talents endured the usual trials of any laboring individual - foul-mouthed clients, dirty patrons, snarky coworkers, absentee bosses - but their temporary status and their lack of experience made them vulnerable to particular kinds of abuse: namely, the exploitation of their labor. few industries make this reality so apparent as do the worlds of finance and of creativity. for those who interned at media groups, galleries, and start-ups (or any other place where the suit is obsolete), exploitation generally manifested itself in the bank account death-sentence that is for college credit only. optimists over-exerted themselves for companies whose futures are as rickety as the makeshift desks that they perched at. to even the staunchest republicans, obamacare began to seem like the greatest idea ever. however, the anxieties and frustrations that erupted from trying to be okay with working from nine to five for free under the guise of the starving artist were generally trumped by the woes of the other group: the bulls and the bears.
the convention proceeded in biden's fashion, rarely going deep into what exactly biden would do to help solve the myriad problems the convention outlined, from gun violence to climate change to income inequality. even warren's speech, in which she endorsed biden's plan to expand child care, did not delve into wonky details.
a true tale from the bad old days illustrates the danger that lies ahead. some time ago, a new bookkeeper for a physical therapy outfit discovered an unpaid bill that was several years old. she sent the patient a letter with a $2,000 bill. the patient, having long believed that his insurance company had paid the bill, was shocked. in the interim, he had moved to europe, where he had excellent state-provided insurance, and thus, no longer had a relationship with his former insurance company.
during the gophuck yourself debates carly fiorina inflamed her base by citing a fake film on planned parenthood that purportedly showed executives selling baby parts.
mark meadows' old seat isn't as conservative anymore.
sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.) threw another wrench in the push to lift the minimum wage to $15 on wednesday, telling reporters he supported a level that was responsible and reasonable. he said in his state that might be an $11 minimum wage when adjusted for inflation.
it's a big reason why the mainstream republican plans would likely result in more uninsured, weaker coverage, or some combination of the two.

when the law was finally enacted, she and her allies understood that it was not everything it could be or everything they wanted it to be. the mantra, from obama on down, was that the new law was a starter home for health care reform ― with a strong foundation, solid roof and sturdy walls.
the only thing that keeps me from utter despair is the realization that social movements swing back and forth, joffe says. they exist in relation to one another. if roe is indeed overturned there will be a massive uprising by women.
but, bagley warned, guessing how judges will vote in future cases is always risky. it's not at all difficult to imagine kavanaugh and the other conservatives voting to strike down the health care law.
all the major democratic white house hopefuls have pledged to return the u.s. to the international climate pact, which trump withdrew from in 2017. the obama health law, known as the affordable care act, also has increased in popularity since obama and biden left the white house, with many republican lawmakers now opposed to pushing for a full repeal.
it was a company that i had not worked at in 20 years, he said. i had a little bit of stock as a family member and when the subject came up i said look the clearest thing to do is to just sell the stock.
to protect himself from political defeat and legal accountability, trump invites his loyalists to revel in lies, cruelty and bigotry ― weaponizing mass inhumanity. millions of americans accept ― or welcome ― the separation, perhaps permanent, of children from their parents. they believe democrats are facilitating a blitzkrieg across our borders by members of ms-13. they imagine that refugees from war and misery in syria are terrorists bent on killing americans. they accept trump's blatant falsifications of the crime rate among undocumented immigrants. if democrats win, he told an audience in ohio, you're going to have crime all over the place. you're going to have people pouring across the border.
death panels, which former alaska gov. sarah palin made popular in 2009, earned the honor of being politifact's lie of the year. there are no such panels in the law.
republican plans to repeal the affordable care act have been met with a largely frosty reception by the public, according to the latest polling released this week.
peterson-kaiser health system tracker spending on hospitals accounts for one-third of all health care spending in the u.s. no other sector comes close.
sometimes black voters often have to say, who else is everyone else going to vote for? todd shaw, professor of political science and african american studies at university of south carolina, said of harris' and booker's campaigns. and i think each of those persons, though strong candidates in their own right, weren't able to get past that bar.
the private sector is much less efficient than public programs. compared to traditional medicare, privatized medicare is more expensive, less efficient, less reliable, more restrictive in choice of physician and hospital, and has much higher administrative costs (e.g. 15 percent overhead compared to about 2 percent for medicare). (5)
the consensus among the five scholars appears to be emblematic of how the legal establishment feels more generally. right before the justice department filed its brief, three career attorneys removed their names from the filing ― a highly unusual move that, many legal observers speculated, signaled extreme discomfort with the government's argument.
indeed, sullivan's support among some labor unions and alaska native communities that a democrat would normally need to win does not bode well for gross. (sullivan's wife, julie fate sullivan, is koyukon athabascan.)
meadows, as the chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus at the time, ultimately convinced trump and republican leadership to pursue a bill that would have undermined protections for people with preexisting conditions. with those changes, meadows was instrumental in getting the bill to pass the house in 2017.
what i am a fan of is trying to figure out how we move the country past where we've lived [during] the past year, which is having constant needs of the american public that are ignored while, at the same time, no ability to have any way to break past the politics of the issue. and so we've never been further apart as a country from what the people of the country demand and what the politics are delivering.
basically, you're asking them to pay twice, he said.
but expect this dark money to stay on the air until the end too. in 2016, when much of the gop establishment stopped investing in the race, because it figured sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) would lose, conservative super pacs stayed on the air. ultimately, all that money helped him pull off a surprise upset of his democratic opponent, russ feingold.
you can't just sit there and take incoming, incoming, incoming, she said. you know you're over the target if you're getting flak.
the price of past democratic compromises is more apparent
those short-term plans will be popular because they are dirt cheap, relative to the usual price of health insurance. but that's only because they aren't available to people with pre-existing conditions and leave out key benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescriptions ― which at least some of those beneficiaries will need when they get sick.
it helped me at a time that i truly needed it, simply because otherwise, i would not have been able to maintain my basic needs, said tyson, now 64. five years ago, tyson spoke to huffpost about her fears that the supreme court would take away her health insurance subsidies, leaving her destitute and possibly homeless.
joe dinkin, national campaigns director for the working families party, a major progressive group that endorsed warren in september, called for her to use the debate to return to her campaign's core themes of fixing a political system riven with greed and corruption.
when the house passed its bill, rushing so quickly that it couldn't even wait for the cbo to issue its final analysis, republican senators swore that they would do things differently. but the process in the senate looks more and more familiar. neither of the two committees with jurisdiction over the bill, the finance committee and the health, education, labor and pensions (help) committee, have held hearings on the legislation's details ― and, as of now, neither committee is planning to do so.
unseating sullivan in a conservative-leaning state famous for sending politicians to washington for decades at a time would be an uphill fight under any circumstances.
and when we pushed further ― mentioning that access to care was a favorite talking point of former house speaker paul ryan's ― underwood said she would really like to not be included in this piece, because there's some kind of framing agenda.
warren's speech laid out a three-part plan to rein in insurance companies: crack down on the practice of shifting costs onto consumers; force private insurers to provide coverage as affordable as medicare and medicaid; and call their bluff if they resist complying with the first two planks.
we will have a wall on the united states-mexico border. the couple of thousand mile stretch will cost $10's of billions to construct. don't count on any gas tax increases to fund our failing bridges, roads, and tunnels for quite a long time. instead, just stay and work at home.
all economic indicators, including evidence from the nonpartisan congressional budget office and the brookings institution, point to the aca exchanges as not in a death spiral. there is no clear or immediate need for congress to repeal and replace the law. premiums have risen, but enrollment has remained steady and more people continue to gain coverage each year.
the recent news from amazon, jpmorgan chase and berkshire hathaway that the three companies plan to team up to create a new company to manage the health care needs of their employees has prompted a flurry of excited pronouncements about what this new venture means for the future of health care delivery in the united states.
a federal appeals court is about to take up a republican lawsuit that could wipe out the affordable care act and, with it, health insurance for something like 20 million people.
the two republican judges peppered the defense with tough questions. and while they also asked some tough questions of the plaintiffs, especially the one representing the trump administration, several observers in the courtroom ― as well as some who listened to court audio afterward ― came away thinking that the two judges were figuring out how, not whether, to write a decision against the affordable care act.
if you have kids, medicaid is definitely worth looking at in every state, pollitz said. this is free, comprehensive coverage. parents can check their children's eligibility and apply for coverage by visiting insurekidsnow.gov. adults can check their own eligibility via benefits.gov.
overall, the middle class could be a winner
for those who have never had to make the painful decision between paying your bills or rent and paying for your health care, it's hard to describe the incredible sense of relief those words gave me. i had gotten my life back! i could focus on being a student and on applying for residency programs without worrying about how i would pay for the medical services i needed to stay alive. i didn't have to ration my health care or make a call to ask a family member for money. what was responsible for this miracle? massachusetts had implemented a version of the aca before the aca .
that was enough to earn him a warm endorsement from sanders on monday night. and on tuesday, it drew a vote of confidence from barkan, although the activist's focus was mostly on the stark choice that voters would face in november.
when we challenged that assertion ― house republicans passed a bill that would have allowed insurers to charge sick people more and would have tried to bring down costs for those people through so-called high-risk pools ― davidson insisted that the gop bill would have protected people with pre-existing conditions in the same way as obamacare.
insurance giant aetna's decision last summer to shut down its affordable care act plans in 11 states created a ton of bad publicity for the law.
with only three states (connecticut, maryland, new hampshire) in the nation living at poverty rates of below 10% of their populations, this isn't a housing crisis any more. this is a housing catastrophe.
mitch mcconnell increased everybody's health care [costs] in that tax cut bill, he said to applause from the crowd of about 40 democratic activists. and mitch mcconnell's tax bill made it so everything you did get would be given back in health care payments.
over in charleston, the local party had 130 people show up at its january meeting, a big jump from the 20 or so they usually see. chair brady quirk-garvan said they've also tripled the number of monthly donors to the party.
but even if sanders could win over the rest of the senate democratic caucus (no easy task given that it includes relative conservatives like west virginia's joe manchin) and even if democrats managed to win enough seats to reclaim the majority (also no easy task given the limited opportunities for democratic pickups in 2020) chances are they'd be well short of 60, with little chance of winning over republicans. that means it'd be impossible to pass medicare for all, or really any other of his ambitious proposals, without changing senate rules so that routine legislation could pass with a simple majority.
we must never, ever, ever, go back to a time when any woman feels she has to make this kind of a choice, she said, raising the hanger high. and this is why we must fight.
i probably see at least a couple a month, said marshall slayton, a charlottesville bankruptcy lawyer, holding up a new file. this is the third case this week.
rep. keith ellison (d-minn.) warned that republicans will try again.
any chance to get past that debate ended when trump decided to back a far-fetched lawsuit against the health care law, which is now headed for the supreme court. it put trump squarely on the side of taking health insurance away from millions, and preexisting condition protections away from many more, right in the middle of a pandemic.
a president can't wave a magic wand and pass any legislation they want, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told huffpost this week.
there were many points during this process when senator collins could have demanded witnesses and evidence, but instead, she voted twelve times to block them, maine house speaker sara gideon, one of the democrats running to challenge collins, said in a statement last week. it was only when senate republicans knew they had the votes to block witnesses that mitch mcconnell gave senator collins a hall pass to break with her party for political cover.
speaking of medicare, buttigieg would also bolster traditional medicare by limiting out-of-pocket expenses for people now on the program. the lack of such a limit, which private policies now have, causes hardship for some seniors on the program.
trump keeps saying nobody could have foreseen the crisis that has hobbled his presidency, but the warning signs were there and they largely went ignored. perhaps the most devastating aspects of trump's response were his repeated dismissals of the severity of coronavirus, his early praise of china, where the disease originated, and his refusal to embrace science, including basic steps such as mask-wearing, until months into the pandemic.
he's got a voting record that matches up pretty well with [house minority leader nancy] pelosi and [senate minority leader chuck] schumer, he said. i don't think we send the cream of the crop to d.c.
pre-existing conditions and the individual mandate
hcsc — the parent company of the bcbs plans in illinois, montana, new mexico, oklahoma and texas — lobbied hard for the changes.
one reason is a provision that has gotten very little attention because it's somewhat technical: a set of policy changes designed to improve the affordability of insurance available through healthcare.gov and state-run exchanges like the maryland health connection and your health idaho.
rep. joseph kennedy iii (d-mass.) has been picked to respond to president donald trump's state of the union address next week.
if it were lisa murkowski, alaska's other ― more moderate ― gop senator, up for reelection, gross wouldn't even be running.
(ap photo/bob daugherty) lawmakers watch closely as pres. ronald reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul on the white house south lawn, oct. 22, 1986, washington, d.c. from left, are: senate majority leader robert dole of kansas, rep. raymond mcgrath, r-n.y.; rep. dan rostenkowski, d-ill., rep. frank guerini, d-n.j.; sen. russell long, d-la.; rep. william coyne, d-pa., and rep. john duncan, r-tenn.
gop lawmakers could do that in minutes if they wanted to.
because they do not envision the kinds of sweeping changes that medicare for all would bring, they leave in place a patchwork system of private and public insurance programs that beneficiaries find confusing and that end up increasing costs systemwide because they make billing and management of benefits so much more complicated.
because of her current role as an executive committee member with the south carolina democratic party, harrington declined to indicate who she'll support in the primary, but she did offer a piece of advice for the democrats running.
democrats oppose the idea of price assuming leadership of health and human services and have raised ethics questions about the physician and six-term lawmaker's investments in health care companies, but he will likely enjoy enough support from senate republicans to be confirmed.
on june 24, 1986 — 189 days after the house passed its bill — the senate approved its version. it took three more months of work in conference to create a bill the two houses could agree on. reagan signed the bill on october 22, 1986 – 11 months after the bill was first introduced.
republicans are stuck. for years, they've promised every conservative group in america that they'll repeal the aca 'root and branch.' until today, they could make those extreme promises without suffering any consequences because they knew democrats or president obama would ultimately block any rollbacks in aca, schumer said.
david anderson, who until recently was an analyst at the upmc health plan in pennsylvania and is now an analyst at duke university's margolis center for health policy, thinks the end result in unregulated states could be deeply bifurcated markets ― with comprehensive, traditional coverage available only at extremely high prices that few could afford, and cheap policies with bare-bones benefits that barely qualify as insurance.
to most democratic voters, however, this public-private hybrid enjoys strong support, the poll shows: 85% of respondents support a public option.
in addition, people in states that didn't expand medicaid who have incomes below the poverty level don't qualify for financial help paying for private health insurance.
democrats believe barrett would side with her mentor and boss, the late conservative justice antonin scalia, who ruled twice to strike down the law. it's an issue they're tying to the coming elections, seeking to make republicans pay a political price for advancing a supreme court nominee so close to election day.
mueller's testimony on wednesday could be the beginning of another tide. but if mueller sticks to his script and democrats fail to capitalize on him finally laying out the findings of his report, it could also be another week that washes away.
asked on thursday afternoon whether trump appreciated the significance of starting a fight with one of congress's most cohesive voting blocs, white house press secretary sean spicer suggested trump was seeking ways to circumvent the freedom caucus or dilute its power. some individual freedom caucus members might be willing to break with their leaders to work with the president on legislative priorities, he implied.
it's not entirely clear what spicer means by a family plan. a plan for the whole family, rather than an individual? one that includes maternity coverage as a special addition?
pressed on the fact that it could mean older workers will have to postpone their retirement if the republican bill passes, toomey said, i will leave it at that.
senator kevin cramer, a republican and trump ally, said he was not overly concerned about attending the white house event.
romney proved most willing to shapeshift in order to secure his political fortune when he turned on the most significant achievement of his political career: romneycare. during the 2012 race, romney called for the repeal of obamacare, the federal health care program that had largely replicated what romney had put into place as massachusetts governor. that flip-flop also disavowed his support for a national health care plan during his first presidential run only four years before. what you have to do is what we did in massachusetts, romney had said then.
the 51-year-old retired veteran, who served in the army from 1984 to 2004, stood outside the zion baptist church at the mlk day march to the statehouse holding a sign for sanders and wearing a t-shirt that read: if you support these programs, the military, the police, firemen, national parks and social security, then you already support democratic socialism.
our best estimate right now is that for every case that's reported, there actually are 10 other infections, redfield told reporters, according to the washington post.
justice elena kagan, one of the three more liberal members of the high court, said it was hard to see how removing a penalty could make the mandate more onerous than it was in 2012 when the court last upheld it.
but maxson, for whom affordable insurance coverage on the obamacare exchange has been a godsend, ultimately concluded it was best to back parnell given the realities of the two-party system.
1. why are bernie fans attacking hillary when berners' (and all democrats') #1 priority should be defeating trump or whoever is the republican nominee?
trump promised to nominate justices who will overturn the ruling and ban abortion rights, however, and supreme court justices often overturn precedents.
hence, trump team disgracefulness power rankings, counting down the week's ten most disgraceful figures in the trump administration. grab a 48-pack of zima and join us.
he denounced biden for voting for the iraq war. biden did indeed vote for the iraq war, but what trump doesn't mention is that he also supported that invasion.
newsom is calling for legislation that would make many more people eligible for assistance ― increasing the thresholds all the way up to $72,840 for individuals and $150,600 for a family of four. the legislation would also provide more assistance for people who already qualify.
in the massachussetts 7th district, ayanna pressley is running against rep. mike capuano in the democratic primary. pressley is the first woman of color to be elected to boston city council. though pressley says she would bring a fresh perspective to congress, capuano has a solid legislative record and seniority in the house. capuano is well liked among constituents and is a member of the congressional progressive caucus.
yet all these responses ― from touting the new venture as an innovative disruption to hailing it as a needed private sector response to the government's failure ― demonstrate a lack of historical perspective on how health care has operated in the united states and how our strange system of tying health insurance to employment has created our present circumstances. in this light, the new venture from amazon et al. isn't a radical intervention in the system but merely a natural evolution of what is already in place. more importantly, it's a response to the failure of free market capitalism, not the government.
but peters has been attempting to raise his profile. he recently gained national attention for talking to elle magazine about how he and his first wife decided to have an abortion in the 1980s. he became the first sitting senator to share his abortion story.
but this is where those caveats come in.
here in the real world, where senate action on any bill generally takes a week and an obamacare replacement could take months or even years, gop leaders are trying to convince members to trust that republicans will be able to come up with something that won't come back to haunt them. some members, however, are reluctant to take that leap of faith.
he is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted, bob haueter, farenthold's chief of staff, told huffpost at the time. once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.
chaffetz got thrashed thursday night during a town hall meeting in his district. voters quickly filled up a 1,000-person school auditorium, and police had to turn away more. the crowd went after him for traditional republican positions like repealing obamacare, but they also attacked him for not looking into trump's more questionable conflicts of interest. they chanted do your job! and ended the night by screaming your last term!
but trump and his allies are also in the middle of a campaign to undermine the medicaid expansion, as part of their war on president barack obama's signature policy achievement ― an effort that's been one of the party's defining crusades since the aca became law.
this is especially worrisome for the millions of people who have already lost jobs because a public health crisis has paralyzed the u.s. economy. according to one estimate, the economic downturn that the novel coronavirus outbreak triggered could leave more than 25 million people uninsured.
the gop effort has two main parts, the first of which focuses on the affordable care act's reforms of the private insurance market.
there's a lesson here for would-be obamacare repealers.
prater declined a request for an interview. dozens of lawmakers and party leaders, both republicans and democrats, as well as lobbyists, declined requests for interviews or didn't respond to requests to comment.
it would need expansion and improvement, but they figured those upgrades would come with time.
anyone who thinks electing sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) president means that medicare for all would become law has an unrealistic view of lawmaking. and it's not just health care. every component of his agenda that requires congress would be a tough slog. but what even more sophisticated voters might not understand is how resigned some of the most liberal voices in congress are to their inability to get items like medicare for all.
i don't represent that woman, he told me and then hung up the phone.
to defend the dignity of every person, i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
now gross, who claims to have been an independent since he was old enough to vote, is following the same path. his father's partnership with then-republican gov. jay hammond, who oversaw the creation of the state fund that sends all alaskans oil revenue checks, inspired his decision not to register with a party, according to gross.
and some republicans are providing an additional fake context, noting that in 2011 pelosi said people would benefit greatly from an extra $40 per paycheck because of a payroll tax cut that passed congress on a bipartisan basis. the payroll tax cut was not part of a trillion dollar corporate tax cut.
don berwick, a physician and former director of medicare and medicaid during the obama administration, was among the experts with whom the campaign shared the plan beforehand. he praised its strong commitment to covering everyone, and noted the private insurance option meant that many people can likely keep commercial insurance if they want it, as in medicare advantage today.
democrats are in the majority now, which means they can convene committee hearings, craft legislation and even put it to a vote ― all with an eye to 2020, when democrats hope to recapture the senate and the white house.
not all of them are going to work. but my interest is only in the ones that i believe are going to move the needle in that direction.
if someone is told that the second amendment gives them a right to shoot hillary if they don't like her picks for the supreme court, hey that's cool.
about a third of americans expect the bill, if passed, would be worse than the current health care law, according to a huffpost/yougov survey released sunday, with 27 percent expecting it to be better and 13 percent saying it wouldn't make much of a change. the poll also found many americans aware of the gop's intraparty fractures on the proposal, with just 11 percent believing republicans in congress were united in support of it.
how aggressively should government control prices?
it's quite a change of tune for cornyn, who voted to repeal or defund the aca (or to move forward with bills to do so) here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here.
stockholm is right in donald trump country. pepin county went for trump by a solid 25 points in the last election, the first time it backed a republican presidential candidate since 1972.
or republicans might turn to the courts. early this year, 20 state republican officials filed a lawsuit calling on the federal courts to throw out the affordable care act, and all of its provisions, because they say it is unconstitutional. in june, the trump administration took the unusual step of siding with the state officials rather than defending the law in court, although it sought to throw out only the protections for pre-existing conditions and not the entire statute.
that's not the end of the story, though. less than three weeks later, chaffetz had a change of heart.
tonight, i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
it's still unclear how far veterans choice will ultimately go, but a healthy debate will help leaders make the best decisions for the future of veterans health care.
cigna is entitled to receive from anthem a $1.85 billion break-up fee if the deal fails to win regulatory approval, according to the merger agreement. the agreement also requires cigna to have put forth its best effort on that front.
biden's plan consists of several interlocking provisions designed to fortify and expand the affordable care act, mainly by spending more government money to help people get insurance and creating a new, government-run insurance plan open to anybody. biden would also let the federal government negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical industry over the price of drugs, and he'd lower the medicare eligibility age to 60.
i will tell you that what oregon did with their medicaid program was highly innovative. i thought personally what [assemblyman] mike sprinkle did in nevada had shown a lot of promise.
i have no patience for dithering or drastic cuts. republicans are welcome in the room ― there's no price of admission ― even as we go forward with reconciliation, sen. richard blumenthal (d-conn.) told huffpost.
the assumption about barrett, based on her legal writings and the impressions of colleagues, is that she would push the court in a strongly conservative direction on issues such as abortion rights. that's a pretty safe assumption, given her past writings and speeches.
people that are currently receiving care in kansas are at risk of being priced out of the care. you're pitting kansans against each other. kari rinker, senior advocacy manager at the national multiple sclerosis society
conservatives are preparing for a showdown on abortion rights following president donald trump's nomination last week of 48-year-old amy coney barrett to fill the position made vacant by justice ruth bader ginsburg's death on sept. 18. barrett is an appellate court judge who once clerked for the late justice antonin scalia.
at a constituent town hall on friday, manchin said he planned to ask kavanaugh, now that the individual mandate has been repealed by the tax law ... what's your opinion on the constitutionality of the aca?
one of his most popular pledges ― that he would drain the swamp of corruption and influence peddlers in washington ― may be his biggest failed promise. trump's administration is teeming with former lobbyists and corporate executives, he and his family are personally profiting from the presidency and frequent golf trips, and the scandals and ethics violations mount by the day. his decision to hold parts of the gop convention on federal property is only the latest.
the government, insurers and medical providers need to work faster at remaking the health care delivery system itself to reduce waste, promote efficiency and better coordinate care, especially people with chronic conditions, berwick said. the obama administration has made some strides in these areas using authorities provided by the affordable care act, but whether its initiatives will succeed on a large scale remains an unknown.
short-term plans are a vestige of the old health care system, the one that existed before the aca took effect and made comprehensive coverage more widely available. at least in theory, these plans are primarily for people with temporary gaps in coverage ― because they are in between jobs, or perhaps about to have a change in their life circumstance like getting married.
he wrote a book and the book bombed, the president said of mccain, whose vote against an obamacare repeal appears to remain a sore spot for trump even six months after the arizona republican's death, the new york times reported.
in private, the president's ridicule would reportedly get physical, mocking mccain (and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell) with gestures and posturing. once, during a meeting, white house aide kelly sadler reportedly dismissed mccain's views with a cruel remark: he's dying anyway.
[a] prosecutor's judgement that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator, mueller's team wrote.
what we all want is to get something done, mcgovern told huffpost on thursday. and i think we want to move the ball forward. we don't just want to do press conferences. i mean, we want to achieve things.
after trump signed a tax bill passed by a republican-led congress that reduced the tax penalty to zero dollars, a coalition of republican-led states headed by texas sued, alleging the tax penalty's elimination rendered obamacare unconstitutional.
he steered away from questions about whether a president can be shielded from being investigated or questioned while in office, and whether the president has the absolute power to pardon himself. moreover, he wouldn't commit to recusing himself if there's an issue involving trump's criminal or civil liability before the court.
• voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.
overall, premiums for people buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers, are rising by 17 percent in michigan ― a double-digit increase, just as trump said. although the majority of consumers are eligible for tax credits that would offset the higher prices, others make too much money to qualify for financial assistance. if they can't switch plans, they'll pay more for their insurance next year.
although the supreme court typically waits until lower courts are through with a lawsuit before hearing an appeal, the court can grab cases under special circumstances, and friday's brief argues that such circumstances exist now.
the saturday confrontation was the latest of several heated moments at republican town halls across the country as the gop looks to repeal the affordable care act.
the first are called premium tax credits, which reduce monthly premiums and are available on a sliding scale to people with incomes between the poverty level and 400% of that amount (about $51,000 a year for a single person). in addition, those who earn between poverty and 250% of poverty ― about $32,000 for an individual ― can receive cost-sharing reductions″ that shrink their deductibles, copayments and the like.
i have five grandchildren and the conservatives have touted a fiscal restraint, and yet we have the largest deficits in the history of the country that my grandkids are going to have to pay, he told huffpost. someone's going to have to pay it; it's going to be my grandkids. trillions of dollars of deficits that have been exacerbated by the tax reform that trump has pushed for the upper class, for those that are the most wealthy in the country.
a second wave of research has risen up to answer such questions, just as workers in clinics, nonprofits and the more progressive public health departments around the country have undertaken an extensive process of trial and error to see just what might be the magic formula needed to help prep succeed among black msm.
the political benefit of this simplicity is that it's easy to explain. the main policy benefit is that it would simplify billing, which means that hospitals, clinics and other providers wouldn't have to hire so many administrative staff. that would make health care less expensive.
not all consumers would like this, but price has some leeway to allow health insurance companies to offer policies with fewer benefits, which would lower premiums in exchange for less coverage.
just how bad? that's difficult to say.
in the tongue-in-cheek ad that runs for just over a minute, a man chopping wood alongside a squirrel named charlie expresses his anger at the age tax.
murray said she thinks republicans have already tried to hamstring obamacare to such an extent that the law might already be more properly labeled trumpcare, since it is no longer the bill passed in 2010, and health and human services secretary tom price is contemplating more ways to hobble the original legislation.
there were other notable adjustments: the convention team clearly planned on creating viral content. billie eilish's performance and call to vote on wednesday night was designed to spread on youth-friendly instagram and tiktok, while a speech from brayden harrington ― a 13-year-old boy who bonded with biden over their shared struggles with stuttering ― will likely get shared on facebook among what the biden campaign called empathy moms.
whether underwood likes our framing agenda or not, she's in a tough district to support medicare for all. she represents the western suburbs of chicago, which has a partisan voting index score of r+5. and the realities of holding seats in districts like that may preclude supporting medicare for all.
that's not only a bad deal for the poor; it has a disproportionate impact on blacks and hispanics. nearly 40 percent of black households earn less than $30,000, followed by 30 percent of hispanic households, according to the center's analysis. only 22 percent of white households earn less than $30,000.
you can put a band-aid on, but you still have 99 other wounds, willmann said.
while some are framing proposals like delauro-schakowsky as moderate alternatives to the sort of plan being promoted by senator sanders or congresswoman jayapal, ultimately this approach would drastically change health care in our country and be a stepping stone to a government-run health care system, partnership for america's health care future, an industry group, said in a statement to huffpost.
cms is evaluating offering a special enrollment period specifically designated for covid-19, she told the journal. we will continue to work with states and health plans around the country to assess what additional actions are necessary to ensure the american people have coverage for and access to the services they need during this time.
but if any congressional republicans want to turn their lies into the truth, they are free to make this ridiculous lawsuit go away.

the washington post via getty images seema verma, who oversees medicaid for the trump administration, has urged states to impose work requirements on medicaid — and approved several applications to do so.
some things i dislike include twizzlers, the smell of wet dogs (though i love dogs!), raw tomatoes, parallel parking, obamacare (most doctors don't), and ear wax.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) has been campaigning for president on a pledge of support for medicare for all. now she is telling voters exactly what she means by that.
mcsally, like most republicans defending their records these days, points out that the house bill called for retaining a few of the affordable care act's regulations and some of the law's tax credits. but the bill would have stripped away funding for expanded medicaid, restructured the tax credits for private insurance, and allowed states to eliminate other regulations ― including the all-important rule prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions.
and the current disagreements among republicans could only become worse once the congressional budget office releases its projection on the effects of the house bill.
the overall tax revenue needed [to implement medicare for all] would depend critically on how much providers are paid. jodi liu, rand corporation

jesse lee is vice president of communications for the center for american progress action fund. he previously served as special assistant to president barack obama and white house director of rapid response.
this emphasis appears to have had some trickle-down effects. cities like new york, san francisco and austin have moved forward on their own to grant workers paid family leave. the issue also became an important one on the campaign trail throughout the primary season. and while just 12 percent of americans currently have access to paid parental leave, there seems to be a shift in some sectors: tech companies in particular have started offering generous paid leave programs, in part to retain talented workers.
and in may, amy mcgrath, a former marine fighter pilot endorsed by the pac, defeated a candidate recruited by the democratic congressional campaign committee in a primary for the democratic nomination in a gop-held kentucky seat that democrats hope to flip.
the affordable care act requires health plans to cover 10 essential health benefits, like hospitalizations and prescription drugs, but gives the department of health and human services the authority to specify how that works.
here's a sampling of the best posts so far:
still, the fact that payment was even an issue says a lot about the coverage that sharing ministries provide their members. pre-existing conditions aren't supposed to matter anymore, under the affordable care act. but they matter for people who enroll in ministries and other alternatives to traditional insurance. more and more americans are doing just that.
what they could get behind was constantly lying about what their plans would do, a tradition trump continued this week. in his tweets, he bemoaned obamacare's high premiums and big deductibles. and a lot of people who have affordable care act policies (plus many more who have job-based health benefits) do pay a ton for health insurance with deductibles in the thousands of dollars.
#yomemo so shady, grass won't grow underneath it. — bryan ⚽️🇺🇸🐍 (@beteunitedfc) february 3, 2018
aarp, which has nearly 38 million members ages 50 and older, is also firmly opposed to a pair of major changes to medicaid that the house bill includes. one is a rollback of obamacare's medicaid expansion, which made the program available to millions of low-income adults, many of them seniors, who had no insurance before. the other is a new medicaid funding formula that could leave states on the hook for more and more money, a report from the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities concluded tuesday. that might force states to make cuts that hurt seniors, many of whom rely on medicaid for nursing home care and other health services.
farenthold's resignation took effect friday at 5 p.m. eastern time. he promptly deleted his twitter and facebook profiles.

kennedy, of brookline, will appear as a blast from the democratic party past, but also as a fresh face on a national platform that could have the power to galvanize voters. he's the great-nephew of jfk and the late sen. ted kennedy, grandson of the late u.s. attorney general bobby kennedy, and son of former congressman joseph kennedy.
if i ran a crooked system and rigged election, i'd blackmail insurers into hiding their aca price hikes until november 9. but that's me. — dave weigel (@daveweigel) october 25, 2016
democrats want to keep pushing in the direction of universal coverage ― whether by making the affordable care act more generous, using government to force down prices, or creating public insurance programs that could supplement or even displace private insurance altogether. these steps inevitably entail some combination of new taxes, government spending and regulation ― and they just as inevitably call for redistribution, from healthy to sick and from rich to poor.
gianforte told republican-leaning lobbyists in a private call on may 5 that he was thankful that the house had passed the ahca, according to the new york times. he has since walked back the comment, telling montana public radio that he would not have voted for the law, because we don't have enough data yet to determine if it would bring down premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and maintain access to coverage in rural communities.
obama has pushed to make it possible for parents to be both engaged with their children and financially secure, signing an executive action granting federal workers six weeks of paid leave after a child is born. he's also urged congress and state legislatures to expand paid leave, and emphasized the issue in his 2015 state of the union address. the labor department, meanwhile, has given grants to states exploring the benefits of granting more workers paid leave.
mr. president, i was born with a disease called sarcoidosis, and from the day i was born, i was considered uninsurable, blaque said. that disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when i went to graduate school, into my brain. … with copays, i'm still paying almost $7,000 a year in addition to the copay.
in a joint statement, house ways and means committee chair richard neal (d-mass.) and committee member rep. danny davis (d-ill.) said congress did not intend to encourage states to withhold food benefits from people who aren't cooperating with child support.
the policy, which the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services calls healthy adult opportunity, is the trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held republican goal: to shrink medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state medicaid programs.
this new bill would cover everyone, offering two weeks of paid time off for workers battling coronavirus and 12 weeks time off — capped at two-thirds of pay — for a variety of reasons. and these provisions would be extended through the end of 2021, a year past the expiration date set in the previous bill.
but if recent history has proved anything, it's that trump is unpredictable and often uninterested in, or at least ignorant of, his own political self-interest. it's just one more reason the people following this case closely are more confident about the merits of their argument than whether that argument will carry the day.
typical was the establishment's darling, marco rubio, who claimed that obama was not simply wrong, but trying to destroy america as we know it. republican politics became not faith-based, but hate-based.
it's fitting for this presidency that most of trump's actions on the issue over that short period took place on twitter, where he made washington's hair stand on end by declaring that obamacare repeal was back and where he eventually retreated after the pretty much the entire republican party begged him to leave this mess alone. meanwhile, democrats can't believe their luck.
adler was actually an architect of the lawsuit in king v. burwell, which could have crippled the affordable care act's newly created private insurance markets in a majority of states. he filed a brief in the case and, in a series of articles and public appearances, frequently squared off with bagley and gluck, who collaborated on their own brief in defense of the law.
in the second part, warren would subject private insurers to stricter cost and quality guidelines in order to achieve parity with medicare and medicaid. the senator noted that medicare and medicaid provide better value to consumers, covering 84 cents for every dollar of health costs, compared to private exchange plans, which tend to cover 60 to 70 cents for every dollar of costs.
we are all supposed to be engaged patients. we are supposed to research our symptoms and diagnoses. but patient engagement is one of the most overused and least understood terms in health care discussions today. everyone talks about the need for it, but few know how to really use patient input. some doctors welcome an informed patient; others not so much. some organizations will put one patient on their board or advisory committee and consider patient engagement done.
we have yet to find any area in which women are better off for carrying the pregnancy to term compared to having the abortion, she says. in a post-roe world, she predicts, the impact of the negative effects will be magnified.

georgia's runoff law, versions of which exist across southern states, was designed to decrease the political power of black voters. its author was a staunch segregationist who blamed bloc voting by african americans for costing him an election.
the four of us do not agree on much, particularly where the affordable care act is concerned, adler, who was an architect of the last lawsuit against the health care law, wrote. but we all agree that the decision ... is unmoored from law or contemporary doctrine.
fighting to keep senate seats in texas and tennessee was never in the gop's game plan (nor in anyone else's wildest imagination).
q: at least the public option wouldn't force people to change coverage. isn't that a big deal?
the largest insurers, which have large capital reserves, probably have the resources to deal with the disruption, david anderson, an analyst at duke university's margolis center for health policy, told huffpost. but some of the smaller insurers that expected to receive risk adjustments payments may see their balance sheet worsen, he said. there is a chance that state regulators may increase their oversight of these insurers, which could lead to liquidation.
also in 2016, in an interview with cnsnews.com, moore called the push to combat climate change one of the greatest propaganda campaigns in world history and blasted the political left for adopting the religion of global warming.
the briefs come less than a week after the u.s. department of justice, in an unexpected legal maneuver, said the entire healthcare law should be invalidated. previously, president donald trump's administration had said portions of obamacare should be struck down and others should survive, including a state-led expansion of the medicaid health insurance program for the poor.
sen. mike lee (r-utah) objected to sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) questioning kavanaugh on an email the judge cannot see.
biden and the democratic party raised a combined $80.8 million in may, a significant jump from their $60.5 million haul in april. that fundraising increase came in tandem with a rise in the polls for biden, who now sits with an advantage of eight percentage points over trump in the aggregate of polls listed by the realclearpolitics site.
perhaps the most striking element of ryan's proposal was its call to reinvent medicare, the wildly popular program for the elderly that politicians attack at their own peril.
the affordable care act sought to reduce the uninsured rate, to implement stronger consumer protections, including guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and to provide financial assistance to low- and middle-income people who couldn't afford health coverage in the past.
we don't have this great flexibility to drive down operating costs ― we have shortages of talent, we don't set the price of drugs, says larry tisdale, vice president for finance at the idaho hospital association. half of idaho hospitals today, over half actually, don't have a positive operating margin.
we've viewed mueller with hopeful eyes, but we are now seeing a vigorous effort to destroy the probe, and none of us can be sure this effort won't be successful.
how government could make a difference
so, a staffer at jimmy kimmel live! hit the streets to see whether pedestrians preferred the affordable care act, harkening back to a 2013 episode that pulled the exact same prank.
for now, the trump administration has continued making those payments. some house republicans have expressed support for keeping the money flowing or even authorizing the spending, which would resolve the legal dispute.
that is really, really critical, because, like i said, people have been lied to and misled, jayapal told huffpost.
republicans have also accused tipirneni of financially benefiting from the aca. her firm, csra, received a contract to assist with obamacare enrollment. but tipirneni said her research work is completely separate and that she has not profited from the landmark health care law in any way.
there's no mystery about this because it was less than two years ago, and the effects of no mandate on health insurance coverage came up in the debate ― not as a peripheral issue, but a central point of contention.
here are some things worth paying attention to:
the house bill also proposed to let states waive rules on how insurers sell and price their policies. with state approval, insurers could have gone back to charging higher premiums to people with serious medical conditions ― to the point of making coverage unavailable.
for almost 8 years the gophuck yourself congress has deliberately and systematically fought to prevent any major social changes and yet obamacare and same sex marriage is one outstanding legacy wouldn't you say?
to be clear, the science is all but irrefutable. climate scientists the world over agree that climate change is real, that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause, and that humans are running out of time to prevent potentially catastrophic impacts.
five years later, with trump in charge, congress passed legislation that reduced the penalty to zero. but the legislation allowed the statutory language of the mandate to remain. according to the gop lawsuit, that transformed the mandate into a command to buy insurance that law-abiding people will feel compelled to obey. two individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit say that's exactly what they are doing.
as part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam.
this includes price's plan, which would claw back regulations on the insurance industry, effectively allowing companies to cover fewer services and impose higher co-pays and deductibles ― and making it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get decent coverage in the first place.
i didn't think most of us realize how many out there feel the same way, and i found that knocking on doors, pratt said. i hope this spurs more throughout the state, i hope this spurs more throughout the country.
canova's opponent in his state's aug. 30 primary, wasserman schultz, has received just 29 percent of her campaign's funds from small donors. larger donors -- giving more than $200 -- account for 36 percent. but last cycle, schulz had the second highest percentage of campaign funds from small donors: 47 percent.
national democrats, for their part, have talked about more wholesale improvements to the system that the affordable care act created ― by making subsidies more generous, for example, or having the government directly regulate the prices of prescription drugs. the most sweeping proposals call for creating a large public program, which proponents call medicare for all, that would cover all americans or at least be available to all of them.
one of their most successful efforts occurred in late 2014, when, led by sen. marco rubio (r-fla.), they prevailed in demanding an end to funding for a different, though similar, program called risk corridors. this program aimed to insulate insurers from losses in the aca's first few years, as carriers were still learning how to craft and sell plans that would work in newly reformed insurance markets.
members with whom huffpost spoke on the record about the situation also expressed frustration, but they tried to direct their anger toward the coronavirus itself and the challenges it's presented to congress.
washington ― after the gop's stunning defeat on health care, and the turmoil it unleashed among lawmakers this week, democrats find themselves with more leverage than ever over an unpopular president in dire need of a legislative victory.
to return to the larger narrative of progress, let's start with the obvious: anyone who wants to go back to the 1950s either likes the idea of a society dominated by straight, white, protestant men, or is forgetting about that reality.
democrats have a big debate ahead of them
mccain then tried once again claimed that the green new deal would force homeowners to spend $600,000 each.
in between those two endorsements, romney blasted trump as a phony, a fraud just months before the 2016 election. yet just as soon as trump won the presidency, romney opportunistically changed his tune, prostrating himself before the president-elect in a desperate attempt to be named his new secretary of state and then publicly thanking trump for backing his senate ambitions.
brady, who by then chaired ways and means, told cnbc in april 2016 that camp made tax reform inevitable, in the sense that he showed you could broaden the base and lower the rates and simplify the code and be competitive around the world. when an interviewer pointed out that camp's own party killed his legislation, brady replied, i don't think it got the oxygen it deserved at the time.
that's the highest level of support since the law was enacted in 2010, according to the hill.
obamacare certainly hasn't worked perfectly. many americans still can't afford coverage, and that includes some people who have pre-existing conditions, especially in arizona, where the market has been notoriously troubled.
similarly, 66% said they would back trump over their own representative; just 10% would support the representative.
sen. rob portman (r-ohio) backed up capito's complaints and added that the house bill goes too far in not protecting communities reeling from the opioid epidemic. still, portman wouldn't offer details on where talks are headed.
the massive spending gap has left both opposing campaigns hoping against hope for a trump intervention. but republicans following the race don't expect him to wade in with an endorsement in the race ― he's praised all three contenders in the past ― in part because any direct intervention will alienate at least some of his allies. (the ward campaign initially agreed to an interview, then stopped responding to requests for comment. the arpaio campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)
still, there's some reason to be skeptical that the events in recent weeks will create a lasting impression on the public, especially with nine months until the election and likely dozens of turbulent trump-fueled news cycles until then. one sign is the lackluster attention the impeachment trial drew on capitol hill. compared to the huge protests over kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, trump's impeachment trial barely drew a handful of sign-toting protesters outside the capitol every day.
q: ok, but at least special interests wouldn't fight so hard. or would they?
until now, the administration's legal position was to let the rest of the affordable care act stand.
all that rhetoric, however, is backed by a standard conservative agenda, which republicans in washington have pushed forward in large part by standing with trump. james wants to repeal and replace obamacare, defund so-called sanctuary cities and cut environmental regulations. democrats have done their best to remind voters that just two years ago, james said he supported trump's agenda 2,000%.
just even if he reads the report, it is going to be new information — and devastating information — about this president. rep. gerry connolly (d-va.)
this could make the long-term care crisis even worse, kahn told the huffington post.
but it's not just industry pressure that advocates must overcome. it's also public anxiety. most working-age people have private insurance and, though they may not love it, polls suggest they're wary of giving it up. this is especially true at a time when faith in government is at historic lows.
just a quick review of romney's relationship with trump makes that all too obvious.
on march 9, house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) clipped a microphone to his tie, rolled up his sleeves and busted out a powerpoint presentation at his weekly news conference in washington, d.c. the subject of his ted talk-style presser was gop leadership's plan to repeal and replace obamacare.
that doesn't sit well with voters, according to polls ― and so, when the subject came up monday during a televised debate between the two, mcsally did what so many other republicans facing similar charges have done.
but it's an open question just how strong or solid that support is.
i asked whether he could be trusted not to rule out certain policy options, given the blessing that health care industry players and republicans have bestowed on his group.
it was trump who began allowing some insurers to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. it's trump backing a supreme court case that would invalidate the entire aca. it's trump who still hollers about obamacare repeal and has no plan whatsoever about what he'd do if he gets it.
how does that pan out in terms of his record in the congress (2000-2012) and as governor (2013-2016)? well, if you are not within his particular spectrum of religious beliefs, it's not good news.
freeman has been active in progressive politics before, but his anger at trump ― especially over net neutrality ― drove him to do more. trump made a leftist out of me, he said.
obamacare extended health insurance to 20 million people who didn't previously have it.
in a subsequent kaiser foundation forum, biden laid out the strategy he intended to pursue as president ― securing quick passage of a measure for children and maybe one or two other elements of his plan, then bringing together stakeholders and republicans to forge consensus on a plan to insure everybody else. he'd said something similar during an iowa debate a few weeks earlier. previously, in new hampshire, he had suggested allowing states to take the lead until a national consensus on universal coverage had come together.
farenthold said after the reports broke that he would repay the $84,000 to the treasury department, but has not made good on that promise. a representative for his office told huffpost in february that the congressman was waiting to see what changes lawmakers will add to the congressional accountability act.
trump denounced so-called cancel culture as like an insidious left-wing thing. he, donald j. trump, has tried to get dozens of people and entities canceled, fired, boycotted, including literally last week: goodyear.
an underfunded, tattered safety net. political decisions in 20 states rationed care by not expanding medicaid under the aca, leading to a projection that more than 7,000 people will die without access to necessary care in those states. (6) moreover, the aca resulted in a medicaid coverage gap affecting almost 5 million americans who fell in between eligibility requirements of the aca and the states, and consequently had no insurance. (7).
and many of them are sanders fans. wasserman schultz resigned from the helm of the dnc just before the party's convention when leaked emails revealed both personal and organization-wide bias against sanders. now, canova supporters hope voters swing toward him as another way to punish wasserman schultz for putting her thumb on the scales during the presidential primary process.
and in the end, the teachers allowed beshear to aggressively expand the political map. one of the most impressive feats of beshear's campaign is that he managed to appeal to both progressive-minded base voters in the big blue cities and more rural areas of the state that typically favor republicans, seemingly without compromising on issues that normally terrify kentucky democrats. (beshear supports abortion rights and some limited gun control measures.) beshear ran up a 100,000-vote margin over bevin in louisville, won numerous counties in the appalachian coalfields, and flipped suburban counties in northern and western kentucky where democrats had struggled to make inroads before.
under the biden plan, monthly premiums for that same gold plan would be just $354. that's 66% lower ― or, to put in more concrete terms, the difference between paying more than $12,000 a year for insurance and just a little more than $4,000.
the resources need to be there to fully implement the good ideas — particularly the ones that focus on expanding access to evidence-based treatment and increasing support for people and families struggling with addiction, olsen said. for this we need more than just the outrage the president expressed in his state of the union address tonight.
this moment is so very high-stakes, said emily martin, a vice president at the national women's law center and former deputy director at the american civil liberties union's women's rights project, where ginsburg was a founding director.
today, the ministries operate in all 50 states and market aggressively on television, radio, and the internet.
trump pressed the senate to confirm barrett before the nov. 3 election, which would create a 6-3 conservative majority on the top u.s. judicial body.
mulvaney, who is also stepping down from his job as head of the office of management and budget, has been a staunch trump loyalist. the president named the former republican congressman acting white house chief of staff in december 2018 to replace john kelly, hailing mulvaney as a great patriot.
overall, they went on to say, repealing the affordable care act would take away $5.5 billion a year from treatment of people with mental health and substance abuse disorders.
the major political, strategic difference i have with obama is it's too late to do anything inside the beltway, sanders, putting a finer point on his differences with most democrats, told vox in 2014. you gotta take your case to the american people, mobilize them, and organize them at the grassroots level in a way that we have never done before.
as we enter the age of artificial intelligence, the rich are going to get richer. we moralize this to our peril. when we begin with the assumption that rich people have no desire to be just or fair, we lessen their interest in working with us (and we increase their likelihood of writing large checks to opponents and partisan media outlets).
occasionally the political will to impose cuts exists, and that's arguably what happened when the architects of the affordable care act created the ipab. but the board's enemies didn't give up, and it looks like they have finally won.
president donald trump's son likened his father's declaration of a national emergency to pay for a wall on the u.s.-mexico border to former president barack obama's 2010 enaction of the affordable care act with this image of kermit the frog sipping tea:

here are some of those questions mulvaney got right, along with their corresponding answers in bold:
in the insurance business, it's referred to as adverse selection when a disproportionate share of expensive customers sign up. given that the purpose of the affordable care act was to enable more americans to get health care, berwick suggested another way of looking at it.
most of trump's supporters see little distance between him and other officials in the party, the poll found.

speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) is so fond of saying show me your budget, show me your values that other democrats have picked up on the adage. and even if lawmakers know this budget is going nowhere and won't be enacted into law, the subtleties of the budget process seem to be lost on many voters.
i told him my dad wasn't a monster, but that he'd voted for trump. that's when he let me know that he, too, had read my profile differently than i'd intended. i actually did vote for him.
one democratic senator who supported the 2017 bill, jeanne shaheen of new hampshire, has pointedly declined to endorse the new version. in the near term, there are faster ways to reach universal coverage by building on the progress we've made through the affordable care act, while addressing the high cost of care and medications, shaheen told huffpost.
asked if she still had concerns about the health care talks, sen. shelley moore capito (r-w.va.) said her problems haven't changed from weeks ago when the house passed its bill.
for starters, there are still 20 states that refuse to expand medicaid using federal money provided by the law, and two-thirds of states declined to establish health insurance exchanges, leaving the work to federal authorities.
the affordable care act mandates maternity coverage because, in the old days, insurance frequently didn't offer it ― or did so only if beneficiaries were willing to pay a hefty surcharge. today, all policies include maternity, along with coverage of mental health care, habilitative care, and prescriptions ― three benefits that, previously, insurers frequently did not.
so how do democrats defeat death itself? there are essentially three camps.
more important, though, giving government the power to set prices would mean giving government the power to set those prices a lot lower than they are today.
and the farm bureau would be under no legal obligation to keep the promises its officials are making today. at any time, it could impose limits, like $7,500 caps on prescription drugs, that exist in other non-compliant plans around the country. if you get an ms diagnosis, you will blow through that $7,500 in your first month, kari rinker, an advocacy manager at the national multiple sclerosis society, said
josh edelson via getty images gov. gavin newsom has said he wants california to pass progressive legislation that the rest of the nation can copy.
but warren (and sanders) got some backup from a somewhat unlikely source: guy cecil, the head of the democratic super pac priorities usa, which is neutral in the primary, said it had tested attacks on medicare for all and other democratic health care plans. in all scenarios, the democrats' approach to health care remains more popular than the gop's support of a total repeal of obamacare, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
promoters of these new policies rarely acknowledge these trade-offs. it's an open question whether most have thought through the consequences of what they propose, or formulated arguments to rebut serious criticism. that's why the conversation now underway is so important. if democrats want to legislate someday, they need to be ready.
ji sub jeong/huffpost blowing up obamacare is a top priority for trump. coming up with a better idea isn't.
and house natural resources committee chairman raul grijalva (d-ariz.) said the doj's decision to go after the aca had changed the political and practical calculus for democrats. the catch-22 both politically and in terms of the health care delivery ― medicare for all, whatever you want to call it ― is that now you have to defend an aca, the things that are in there, and protect it, grijalva said.
(some pregnant women will likely unable to obtain adequate prenatal care under the proposed gop legislation.) 14 million is twice the population of massachusetts (where a policy with similarities to the later obamacare was initiated in 2006 by then-governor republican mitt romney).
blue cross blue shield association the costs of caring for consumers who purchase health coverage on the affordable care act's exchange marketplaces or directly from an insurer rose from 2014 to 2015, the blue cross blue shield association reports.
it doesn't matter that trump and his folks are breaking laws, trying to kill obamacare, pre-existing conditions or that his handling of the pandemic was disastrous, he wrote. to trump voters he is their guy. more importantly he's 'their president' and disagreeing with them is a personal insult. gaffigan called the notion not only weird but kind of scary.
the law would create tax breaks that could be used to purchase insurance and that would increase with age. but they only increase by a factor of two, which is not enough to cover the full cost of the increase. the provision, which aarp has dubbed an age tax, would be a significant increase from the current 3-to-1 ratio permitted by obamacare. due in part to this increase, the replacement law would lead to a 20 percent to 25 percent rise in premiums for 64-year-olds by 2026, according to cbo.
the special sign-up opportunity is only a down payment on health insurance for biden, who has promised to build on former president barack obama's health law to push the u.s. toward coverage for all. for that he'd need congressional approval, and opposition to the health law still runs deep among republicans.
the current market for health care just doesn't deliver. it is deeply, perhaps fatally, flawed, rosenthal writes. even market economists themselves don't believe in it anymore.
there are no limits, and you just have to pay the co-pay, the doctor told me.
racism. given that all of you deplore it, i can feel you bridling. but the troubling signs proliferate. voter suppression laws aimed at minorities in states where no evidence of fraud exists. scapegoating american muslims -- many of whom have more experience defending our country than any of us -- as potential terrorists. targeting illegal immigrants whose presence owes as much to american business interests as to their own desperation.
i look at what's going to benefit myself, as well as my brothers and sisters around me, she told huffpost. for her that includes black maternal mortality rates, prison reform and voter suppression.

the u.s. government said in september it would broaden its nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals and require health insurers and medical providers to treat all patients equally, regardless of sex.
a ruling against the affordable care act would also end extra federal funding that underwrites the expansion of medicaid, which nearly three-fourths of the states have now undertaken, so that it is available to all people below or just above the poverty line.
currently these groups do not ship pills to the united states, because their mission statements limit them to countries where abortion is illegal, and the u.s. does not qualify. but women with american addresses are sent a list of other websites that do ship domestically.
@daveweigel: if trump doesn't watch out, key republicans may pronounce his comments disappointing before donating to his re-elect and voting for him.

bloomberg via getty images republican governors like florida's rick scott did everything they could to undermine the affordable care act. if democrats take their positions in november, it could make a big difference in how the law's reforms play out.
in that light, maybe it's refreshing that trump told the truth about one thing this week: there is no republican health care plan. let's check back after the 2020 elections to see if that ever changes. don't bet on it.
two things back up hanauer's opinion. one is polling.
though i'm going to use the term we, i'm not actually a democrat. but i have close friends in each camp, and i see more common ground between them than many would suppose. people are dimensional. for all the hard words thrown and hard lines drawn of late, many are still open to their better angels calling them to higher perspective.
education: there is no issue of greater importance to latinos than education and our community of voters understands that, by and large, our public schools are failing to prepare their children for academic and career success. sure, educational attainment rates are improving but too many of our kids are falling through the cracks, dropping out, and are on the margins of the national economy. latinos are looking for a president who will commit to large-scale interventions to improve their children's education, including the implementation of universal pre-kindergarten in cities across america and a plan to invest much greater resources to improve teacher education, access and quality of english language learner (ell) programs, enhance after-school programming and advance community school models. they are also looking for a candidate that will address the college affordability crisis by significantly lowering college tuition rates and partnering with universities and community-based organizations to invest in college retention programs for at-risk students.

the group's moves were designed to look like a play to boost blankenship. but it quickly became clear its actual goal was to bury jenkins, a democrat-turned-republican who had unseated a long-time incumbent to win his house seat four years prior. duty and country spent $1.8 million attacking him, and only $47,000 attacking morrisey, whose past work lobbying for pharmaceutical companies democrats saw as a major vulnerability in the general election.
there are many demographics of black voters, he said. there are multiple black needs and if you're going to develop a strategy to appeal to people of color you have to recognize there are multiple boxes to check.
if the case does ultimately reach the supreme court, and five justices agree to strike down the affordable care act, experts say it would upend the u.s. health care system and strip health insurance from an estimated 20 million people. many millions more would lose crucial protections they might need in case of catastrophic medical issues ― including coverage for those with preexisting conditions.
at a preview lunch with broadcast news anchors ahead of tuesday night's state of the union address, president donald trump trashed his political rivals, including the late sen. john mccain, several outlets reported.
it's a highly unusual move because the justice department usually defends federal laws in court, and even conservative legal experts find the case baffling. and yet trump is backing it, which means his administration is literally calling for a judge to throw out the provisions of the law trump insists he wants to keep.
jayapal added she wasn't concerned there'd only be one bite at the apple for health care because she didn't think pelosi's fixes would adequately address the tens of millions who are still uninsured or the majority of americans who are still facing exorbitant health care costs compared to other countries.
as for ocasio-cortez's win, moulton cautioned against making too much of it.
republican madison cawthorn wasn't the gop's pick to replace white house chief of staff mark meadows in congress. the 24-year-old beat out the republican party's — and trump's — pick for the seat in a surprising upset and has since he's been named a rising star in the party. he is facing democrat moe davis, a former military prosecutor, who is running on a public option and expanding broadband internet — dire issues in western north carolina.
the trump administration's outrageous decision tonight to sabotage open enrollment will mean coverage could cost more next year and insurers could drop out of the marketplace, counihan said.
trump claimed he could have raised more. he said he could call the heads of wall street firms and ask for millions, but added: i can't do that though, because you know what, if i do that, i got to do things for them. i could be the world's greatest fundraiser, but i just don't want to do it.
yet another idea kaiser tested is a more ambitious initiative that would create a new government-run insurance plan open to anybody, on a voluntary basis. in this scheme, employers would have the option to keep offering their own plans, thereby giving their employees a choice.
the democratic legislation would restore funding for health insurance enrollment outreach and assistance, which trump deeply cut, and would provide new funding for states that establish their own insurance exchanges rather than use the federal healthcare.gov system for enrollment.
we all agree that the decision ... is unmoored from law or contemporary doctrine. jonathan adler, case western law professor, on his joint brief critical of the district court ruling against the affordable care act
on feb. 29, south carolina voters head to the polls to vote in the state's primary election. in presidential races, candidates often look to the palmetto state as an indicator of how strong their support among black voters ranks nationally. it's an important demographic in a key state. but often, black voters are clumped into one monolithic group by candidates and the media without an accurate representation of the many perspectives within the community.
but others claim the republicans just cherry-picked a few gop-backed ideas from the baucus-camp work. baucus said in an interview with the center that the 2017 tax law has some elements of the legislation he and camp proposed, such as cutting the corporate tax rate, only taxing domestic corporate profits, and reworking taxes on the profits of multinationals to get them to return their money to the united states.
and yet, 25 women have accused trump of sexual misconduct, and his administration is bent on rolling back women's rights and gender equality in a number of ways, from abortion rights to health care to equal pay to lgbtq rights.
employers could have a role, too. they contract with insurers to offer insurance directly to employees, as long as it met the same high standards for benefits and the employees still had the option of enrolling in the government-run plan instead.
with all that in mind, it's hard to see where trump and gop lawmakers go together, because it's not clear they ultimately want the same thing.
health policy is all about tradeoffs, and the biden plan has its share. with the biden plan in place, it's likely that the number of people with employer-based insurance would fall and the number of people with subsidized coverage (including the public option) would rise.

back from the break. sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) again brought up the records issue with grassley.
the problem with this argument, the five scholars argue, is that the courts don't need to hypothesize about what congress would or wouldn't want without the penalty. congress made its intentions quite plain, just a few months ago, when it zeroed out the affordable care act mandate without touching anything else in the statute.
whenever there have been victories of any kind for black people, for other people of color, in our america, there is almost an insanely immediate reaction of great discomfort and great backlash. it happened with the civil rights movement, it happened with obama. it is a sick need to prove superiority, to restore the so-called natural way of things in america, which means white people at the top and the rest of us scrambling at the bottom, evermore.
the reason medicare for all can provide coverage to everybody, while spending less money, is that the government would regulate prices throughout the health care sector ― not just on prescription drugs, but for doctors and hospitals and everything else.

never mind that the details for the new company are few. other than the announcement of the joint venture, leaders from the three companies have been unable to say what their new organization will do exactly. but that hasn't stopped the sort of irrational exuberance that often greets the slightest hints of innovation from the private sector, especially in the realm of health care.

the decision to jump into this health care case, on the side of the plaintiffs out to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, could put the issue back in the public eye. that could work well for democrats, who have made clear they believe health care is a winning political issue for them again.
just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the united states became unmistakable, president donald trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.
q: what's the best argument for medicare for all?
republicans have sought for years to dismantle obamacare, including a popular measure that stops insurers from charging more to people with pre-existing conditions or rejecting them for coverage outright. but after the gop's failed attempts last year to repeal and replace the affordable care act, republicans now are seeking new headlines.
it's just who i am, evers said of his low-key, low-drama, low-excitement style in a phone interview a few hours after his rally with sanders. i think people are sick of polarization, and sick of not getting things done.

kantar/cmag data for huffpost the number of ads that republicans are running against obamacare is also down this cycle.
the reality is that insurance arrangements in the u.s. are not static. employers frequently alter benefits from year to year, while individuals often must switch plans when job status or income changes. in the process, many end up with inadequate coverage or no coverage at all.
it was the greatest political crime in the history of our country. ... people should be going to jail for this stuff, trump told fox business this week. he went on to accuse both obama and his vice president, joe biden, who is now the presumed 2020 democratic presidential nominee. this was all obama. this was all biden.

now, with democrats in charge of the house, it will be even harder for republicans to make needed fixes in their bill. and because republicans control the senate, democrats will find their way blocked to changing or repealing parts of the law. instead, they promise to hold hearings on the parts of the tax bill they say are confusing – or they just don't like.
people would start using more health care services, for instance, because they had coverage for the first time or because the nyha plan, like medicare for all, would be more generous than existing coverage. that would tend to drive up the program's costs.
a record number of kentucky educators launched bids for public office during the 2018 campaign cycle, many with eyes set on state legislative seats. the teachers scored some early wins, but overall, 2018 was a bit of a disappointment. republicans retained supermajority control of the state legislature, despite the best efforts of democrats. the teachers tried not to get discouraged.

the argument has many weak links, scholars have argued, but probably the weakest is the claim that possible congressional intent from 2010 matters more than what congress did less than two years ago. congress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions, a group of experts wrote in a brief they filed with the court earlier this year. it repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place.
the crowd also pushed reed to pressure president donald trump to release his tax returns. reed was one of 23 republicans who voted against legislation to request trump's tax returns from the treasury department.

frelinghuysen's decision is yet another bad electoral sign for republicans, as there are now twice as many open seats currently held by republicans as there are by democrats. the announcement already prompted the cook political report to change its rating of the district on monday from lean republican to toss up.
to recap: zero people have actually enrolled in this insurance because it is literally impossible to do so until sept. 1 at the earliest. and as for obamacare being a disaster, its current problems have a lot to do with trump himself.
the 2017 medicare for all bill had 16 democratic senators as co-sponsors, far more than sanders had recruited previously, and the 2019 version has nearly as many. among the democratic senators on both the old and new bills are cory booker of new jersey, kirsten gillibrand of new york, kamala harris of california, and elizabeth warren of massachusetts ― all of whom, like sanders, are seeking the 2020 democratic presidential nomination.
over the years, amid the successes of his trump tower building in new york and various golf courses around the world, trump's business career has been littered with failures. there were branding flops like trump steaks and trump vodka. outright fraud in the case of trump university. but most consequential was the spectacular cratering of his new jersey casinos, which brought him to the brink of personal bankruptcy.
but what he didn't know then was that more than a decade later, he'd be finessing his way into an exclusive event to hear president donald trump speak about criminal justice reform at benedict college, the historically black college he attends. king, a mass communications major, wasn't one of the seven benedict students permitted to attend the event on oct. 25, but that didn't stop him from trying. equipped with his camera, he showed a ticket that event coordinators previously said they wouldn't honor and walked right in.

under the affordable care act, 36 states expanded their medicaid programs to allow any adults who earn up to 133% of poverty, or about $17,000 a year for a single person, to get benefits. nebraska will be the 37th state to expand medicaid when its broadened eligibility rules take effect in october. wisconsin didn't fully expand medicaid but offers coverage to people earning up to the poverty limit, which is about $12,800 a year for a single person.
democratic officials from 20 states plus the district of columbia, along with the u.s. house of representatives, have stepped in to defend the affordable care act because the justice department, heeding trump's order, will not.
the bill is largely similar to the one passed by house republicans in may. nearly 23 million americans were estimated to lose health coverage under the house bill, known as the american health care act, according to the congressional budget office. lawmakers hope to have the cbo's analysis for the senate's version by early next week.

admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs, exacerbates the problem, the proclamation says. data, according to the statement, show that lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than united states citizens to lack health insurance.
that is why i won't listen as the pundits and politicians decree from on high. i refuse to play by washington's political rule book, or subjugate myself to the whims of the political class, carson wrote.
the affordable care act is failing. some insurance companies are bailing out as they are experiencing financial losses. some larger companies are trying to merge but are being blocked by the government who are afraid of monopolistic practices. healthy people are not participating in the numbers expected since the tax penalties of abiding by the individual mandate are less than the insurance premiums and copays and there is no penalty for waiting until the need for insurance arises (community rating). two thirds of the obamacare co-ops have withdrawn and two more are threatening to leave. they could not continue to sustain financial losses while still meeting their obligations to their policy holders.
she is certainly conservative in her views, in her rulings, and we'll have to see how that all works out, but i think it will work out, trump said monday during an interview with fox news, adding that it is certainly possible that roe will be overturned with barrett on the court.
the party that decries judicial activism appoints conservative ideologues committed to enacting the retrograde social agenda of white evangelicals. the party of middle-class america sabotages obamacare by driving up premiums and gutting protections for those with pre-existing conditions. the party of working-class whites savages unions and attacks regulations protecting workers from injury or exploitation. the party of phony populism promotes plutocracy.
president barack obama's administration made them comply with the affordable care act's rules requiring health plans to provide a minimum, basic set of benefits (things like prescription drugs and maternity care) and limited how insurers could set prices based on the health status of the workers.
the tax bill, if enacted, would be among the least popular pieces of major legislation signed into law since the 1990s. support for the bill stands at an average of about 32 percent, according to current polls, with nearly half of the public opposed.

other cuts, outlined in an annual major savings and reforms volume that's ignored every year, include eliminating heating subsidies for the poor and $405 million worth of grants to boost community service work by senior citizens, along with plans to dramatically slash legal aid to the poor, the national endowment for the arts, and subsidies to states such as california saddled with high costs for jailing criminal migrants who enter the country illegally.
in the months leading up to passage of the 2017 tax act, trump administration officials and republican leaders in congress giddily compared the scope of their bill to reagan-era law. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady (r-texas) called their new bill, the first action in 31 years since president reagan's reforms in 1986. then-national economic director gary cohn said the legislation represented the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986.

when sen. pat roberts announced his retirement, republicans weren't concerned about holding his seat. democrats, who haven't won a kansas senate seat since the 1930s, figured they might have a shot if kris kobach ― known for his hardline anti-immigration views ― ran again, since the party managed to defeat him for the governor's seat in 2018. kobach did end up running for the senate seat, but he lost the primary to rep. roger marshall, a party-line republican with a relatively low profile.
instead, mccain died of brain cancer in 2018, and isakson resigned at the end of 2019 following a diagnosis of parkinson's disease. both vacancies triggered special senate elections in 2020, which democrats mark kelly and raphael warnock won.
when asked if he's heard anything objectionable in kavanaugh's testimony so far, manchin told cnn on wednesday, i haven't seen anything from that standpoint. he's handled himself very professionally.
it was supposed to be a reunion of the officials who led the effort to pass obamacare and had been present at the white house signing ceremony on march 23, 2010.
he also joined republicans in signing a legal briefing urging the supreme court to revisit the landmark roe v. wade abortion rights case. he did close ranks with other democrats to support the 2019 equality act that the house passed and which would protect lgbtq people from discrimination in housing, the workplace, public accommodations and other settings.
stevenson has voted since he was 18 years old. his goal this go-round is to defeat the current individual in the white house.
take south dakota. it is one of the seven states in the country that are down to a single clinic, and there is no full-time doctor onsite, so abortions are performed by a rotating team of physicians who fly in from other states, says carole joffe, a sociologist at the university of california at san francisco who studies abortion history and access. the single clinic means a drive of hundreds of miles for many women, who potentially miss work and pay for child care while they make that journey.
all of this is taking place against the backdrop of the presidential election, which could mean a new president, a new senate majority or both starting january ― with the power to pass a one-sentence law that would effectively render the whole case moot.
myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes weakened, fatigued muscles. julie buckholt, 58, and her two adult daughters have this condition, which has no cure, and all require regular injections of intravenous immunoglobulin.
three health care experts broke down the original price bill, to see how it would affect total costs for enrollees ― in other words, not just premiums, but also out-of-pocket costs. they published their results in vox last week: although premiums would be lower under the republican plan, this decrease would be offset by an increase in cost sharing. once the differences in tax credits are accounted for, the republican plan would increase total costs for every age group except for those under 25.
less than a week after he stood in the house chamber and said in his state of the union address that he wouldn't cut medicare or social security, the president offered a budget blueprint monday that would do both.
former press secretary sean spicer, after first ridiculing reporters who asked about the value of presidential tweets, soon was forced to concede that trump's tweets were, by definition, official statements of the president. since then, press staff and others have frequently responded to particularly absurd missives with the all-purpose: the tweet speaks for itself.
stiglitz, je. evaluating economic change. daedalus 133/3, summer, 2004.
but ministries frequently acknowledge, as gardner put it, that health care sharing isn't for everyone. although they don't generally specify exactly who that might be, it's easy enough to figure out.
after being vastly outraised and outspent by his challenger in the past month, the cavalry arrived for graham this week as republican groups allied with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) dumped tens of millions of dollars into ads tying harrison to liberal democrats like senate minority leader chuck schumer and house speaker nancy pelosi. in one ad run by graham's campaign, harrison is shown repeatedly in a conversation with socialist sen. bernie sanders, calling the independent senator from vermont a champion.
when great britain surprisingly voted to leave the european union, the eyes of the nation quickly turned to texas. with its unique history as an independent republic, texas seems like an american quebec, the most likely state to want to strike out on its own. liberal americans might be glad to see it go, though texans themselves believe they have a right to secede but express little desire to do so.
sad stein: a sad day for all of us at huffpost. our dean, sam stein, who has been at the organization for a decade, is marking his last day. sam has been an incredible colleague and friend: building up and cultivating the huffpost politics team into one of washington's best. he's that rarest of newsroom creatures: an incredibly talented reporter and editor who is also a genuinely good person. we'll miss him dearly and wish him all the best at the daily beast, where he'll be helping to direct its politics coverage.
the loss of rural hospitals not only means patients having to travel longer distances to the next medical providers, but the closures also can often have a crippling effect on the local economy.
our new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement ― or usmca ― will replace nafta and deliver for american workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding american agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the usa.
the democratic senators who voted against the measure were: richard blumenthal (conn.), cory booker (n.j.), catherine cortez masto (nev.), dianne feinstein (calif.), kirsten gillibrand (n.y.), kamala harris (calif.), mazie hirono (hawaii), patrick leahy (vt.), ed markey (mass.), robert menendez (n.j.), jeff merkley (ore.), chris murphy (conn.), bernie sanders (vt.), jon tester (mont.), elizabeth warren (mass.) and ron wyden (ore.).
trump administration officials, like their kentucky counterparts, know this. in their letter approving the proposal, they previewed their defense by making the same argument they did on thursday ― that requiring able-bodied medicaid recipients to work would improve their health outcomes and help them become familiar with the way private health insurance works. that is why, the administration said, it was within its rights to approve kentucky's request as a demonstration project.
perhaps the most intriguing finding of the aarp poll is that older americans of all political stripes support taking a harder line with pharmaceutical companies to control medicare's costs. given a choice between turning medicare into a voucher and empowering the program to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies, 78 percent of voters surveyed, including 67 percent of trump voters, backed drug price negotiation. a similarly high percentage of respondents believe that drug prices are the result of big drug company monopolies and the deals their lobbyists make.
i think a lot of people bring a lot of passion to health care. it is the most personal of all issues. and i think people are reading into the formation of our group some things that they're reading into because they were unclear [about the group's goals], which is understandable. and some are things that they're reading in because they have passion for the issue and think that it's set up to do things that it's not intended to do.

i think it's been a wake-up call for pro-life voters around the country who understand, in a very real sense, the destiny of the supreme court is on the ballot in 2020, the vice president said.
with donald trump out of the white house — not a joke — you will see an epiphany occur among many of my republican friends, biden said at a may 14 campaign stop in new hampshire.
crumb (n) -- a very small amount of something. google dictionary
the white house, meanwhile, proposes using its own in-house numbers-crunchers. spicer suggested that the office of management and budget – run by trump appointee mick mulvaney – would be a better source for an accurate assessment. unlike the congressional budget office, the omb isn't independent, and answers to the president.
but in addition to running for re-election in a state that has been trending republican, baldwin is up against an enormous amount of conservative spending and the political machine of the state's republican governor, who is also on the ballot this year.
sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) voiced her concern over kavanaugh's stance on gun rights, citing a dissent in which he argued that a ban on semi-automatic rifles violated the second amendment, according to the argument laid out in a 2008 supreme court decision, because those weapons are not so different from semi-automatic handguns, which the opinion said were generally protected. at the hearing, kavanaugh defended his opinion and disagreed with feinstein's assessment that the weapons are not in common use.
risk adjustment doesn't always work that well in practice. a 2015 new england journal of medicine study found evidence that insurers were using benefit design to dissuade sicker people from choosing their plans, even with the aca's risk adjustment program in place.

stepping in for the federal government in this affordable care act are democratic state leaders, led by california attorney general xavier becerra, who are defending the law instead. officials from connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, kentucky, massachusetts, minnesota, new jersey, new york, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, vermont, virginia, washington state and the district of columbia also are participating.
that agenda includes issues such as securing our borders, repealing and replacing obamacare and restoring the american economy.
as the campaign continues and, he hopes, gains more traction, mayville expects reclaim idaho will get more help. more and more people around the state, organizations around the state, are seeing the momentum we have and they really believe in this cause, he told huffpost.
the ads will run on most digital platforms, including facebook, snapchat, hulu and spotify. but this buy will also include the first-ever political ads on twitch, a video game streaming platform.
medicare and medicaid, signed into law by president lyndon b. johnson in 1965, would fill in those gaps. like all efforts to provide any sort of government-based health care, the programs faced stiff opposition from business leaders at the time. but they were also the logical consequence for a nation that had opted for an employment-based system rather than a comprehensive federal program. in such a scenario, the government had to pick up the slack for the people the private sector was not serving.
that's one of the arguments behind so-called health cost savings programs.
if the challengers were also to prevail at the highest court in the land, the effects of a ruling to invalidate the entire affordable care act would touch virtually all aspects of the american health care system, which remade itself in significant ways to comply with the affordable care act.
obamacare forbids insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher rates for people because of their medical histories. the republican plan that passed the house last week would allow states to waive those protections, paving the way for insurers to charge sick people higher rates.
the debate over approving funds to tackle zika has raged in the senate for months. democrats tried multiple times to push through the president's full $1.9 billion emergency request to battle the virus, which has now infected roughly 2,700 people in the united states and its territories, including nearly 500 pregnant women.
the next day he told me i'd earned his colleague's seal of approval for that comment. not only was he talking about me to his peers, he wasn't afraid to show himself in a submissive stance. i swooned.
the obstacles to success are real, and not just because of idaho's conservative political base.
the messages flew. this was over thanksgiving, so we had more time than usual to flirt via text. he was funny without being overly familiar, interesting and interested, so he didn't seem full of himself, and we discussed how both of us had made our way in life without much parental support.
as the narrator mentioned impeachment, images of massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, vermont sen. bernie sanders and new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez appeared onscreen.
as they see it, a penalty of zero cannot be a tax; that makes the mandate, whose language remains part of the affordable care act statute even though it has no force, unconstitutional. and if the mandate is unconstitutional, the plaintiffs say, then the rest of the law is unconstitutional. too, because congress in 2010 had intended for the affordable care act's interlocking pieces to work together.
there is a big difference between a court choosing to sever a part of a law, and congress doing so itself, solmin wrote at the volokh conspiracy blog. and in this case, congress has already effectively neutered the individual mandate, while leaving the rest of the aca in place.
the other day in a yoga class the teacher said, through the practice, we learn to see what binds all beings, rather than what separates us. this feels more important now than ever before.
as hillary clinton tweeted just a few days ago, a quarter of renters in the u.s. spend more than half their income on rent. we need to make housing more affordable.
gergen added: i thought it was a deeply disturbing speech.
we had so many people we had to leave the conference room that we were supposed to be in and move out to the lobby of the building because there was no room to fit everybody, said whitney pastorek, a member of the executive committee.
senate republicans are still debating what to do with the better care reconciliation act, their proposal to unwind reforms of the private insurance market and make deep cuts to medicaid. gop leaders, unable to rally 50 votes for the plan this week as they had originally hoped, are now modifying the proposal and have said they aim to take it up again ― and pass it ― once the senate returns from its july 4 recess.
jay hancock/khn carolyn davis got injections at uva health system to treat back pain that her insurer did not cover. uva rejected her application for financial assistance because her husband, a hardee's cook, had $6,000 in a hardee's retirement account.
if mitch mcconnell, paul ryan, and donald trump had two years like they just had without me in the senate and other noble progressives who fought them with you to prevent the taking away of health care, we would have lost that battle — obamacare would have been gone, he told the crowd of activists.
an existing plan from unitedhealth will help pay for prescriptions, but only up to $3,000. and it won't cover mental health care at all, except in states that require it.
none of this means women are no longer harming themselves while trying to end their pregnancies, however. it's still happening, despite roe remaining in effect, particularly in places where abortion access is difficult.

economic opportunity: the great recession decimated latino families' wealth. in virtually every latino community in the united states, the contraction of the economy meant lay-offs, increased indebtedness and diminished home values. as the economy has slowly begun to recover, so too have some latino families. but the impact of the financial crisis has had powerful consequences on latino households and all too many families find themselves barely getting by. homeownership rates among latino families are still well below where they were in the pre-recession years. the next president has the power to make an immediate difference in the lives of these struggling families. an important first step would be a commitment to making major federal investments in creating new, good-paying jobs in the energy sector, manufacturing and construction industries, and workforce training programs that will allow latinos and other marginalized workers the opportunity to fairly compete for these jobs. additionally, the next president must push for legislation that guarantees pay equality for america's women. latinas are paid just 54 cents on the dollar compared to non-hispanic white workers. latinos want a candidate to provide clear policy proposals that promote greater economic security and mobility, including opportunities to grow small businesses, increase homeownership, participate in job training initiatives and strengthen income support programs.
as scandal after scandal piled up for the trump administration last week, republicans were given some cover. rather than being flooded with questions as they exited multiple meetings about their own disagreements on how to repeal and replace obamacare, they were asked about the firing of fbi director james comey and the investigation into russia's meddling in the presidential campaign.
one judge has already ruled in favor of this lawsuit ― a lawsuit that, to be generous, is stupid ― and if that decision stands through appeals, it would devastate the health care system.
people seeking to replace job-based health insurance from an exchange must first apply for the right to shop for coverage. this requires documentation from a former employer or former insurer verifying that the previous coverage has ended or is ending soon. people trying to enroll in an exchange policy or an affordable care act-compliant plan directly from an insurer have 60 days from the date they lose coverage to complete a new enrollment under these rules.

continuing the theme of his opening statement tuesday, sen. sheldon whitehouse (d-r.i.) pressed kavanaugh on the network of conservative special interests and its heavy influence on the supreme court in recent years.
democrats have launched a serious bid to win an april 24 special election for arizona's 8th congressional district, scaring national gop groups into spending major money on a seat that was once considered safely republican.
a challenge to the affordable care act got a relatively hostile reaction at a virtual supreme court hearing on tuesday, offering hope for the millions of people who depend upon the law for their health care.
macarthur repeatedly insisted that no one with pre-existing conditions will be declined coverage or priced out of being able to buy coverage under the gop health care bill. he argued that moving people with pre-existing conditions out of the private insurance system and into high-risk pools would preserve the status quo.
in 2014, as scotland debated independence from great britain, reuters asked respondents do you support or oppose the idea of your state peacefully withdrawing from the united states of america and the federal government? narrowed down to your state only 24 percent supported withdrawing from the united states. as you might expect, there were differences across regions: 19 percent of northeastern residents supported peacefully withdrawing from the united compared to 34 percent in the southwest (including texas) and 25 percent in the southeast.
perhaps worse still was biden's suggestion that sick people could be hurt during the four-year transition from the current health coverage system to a new, medicare for all program.
and just last year, during a public discussion of medicaid with national review editor rich lowry, he remarked that we've been dreaming about cuts to such social programs since you and i were drinking out of a keg.
mitch mcconnell is a transcendent figure in american politics; he is a unifier. he unites everyone in hatred and animosity toward him, including republicans, said matt canter, a democratic pollster at global strategy group who recently conducted a survey that could guide democrats' anti-mcconnell efforts. he's a walking, talking definition of what people hate about washington and the corrupt political system today.
biden would also open subsidized plans to all americans. that'd be a big change from the affordable care act, which opens subsidized plans only to people who can't get an affordable employer plan.
she's our secret weapon, trump said.
medicaid: the released bill grows per capita medicaid at cpi medical, as opposed to cpi medical plus one percent in the 2/10 draft. the released bill also adds language allowing states to disenroll high-dollar lottery winners.
president donald trump and his administration have a message for uninsured americans who fear the cost of treatment for covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus: we don't care.
here's a video of the interview. his aca comments are around the 6-minute mark.
immediately after trump's election, ryan joined with his senate counterpart, majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), to vow immediate action on repealing the affordable care act. but although wiping out obamacare had become the gop's defining cause, and one trump had identified as his top priority, multiple efforts to pass sweeping repeal bills failed.
for the first time in an election cycle since obamacare's passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. democrats now have a sizable advantage over the gop on the issue, too. and in a recent huffpost/yougov poll, voters chose health care as one of their top issues.
in an op-ed earlier this month, hawley wrote about discovering that one of his two young sons suffers from a rare condition that can lead to degeneration of his joints, and declared, insurers should also be required to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions and young people on their parents' insurance. in the same op-ed, he wrote that obamacare was a big government-big insurance collusion scheme that needed to go.
neither the sanders nor jayapal legislation specifies exactly how much the new public plans would end up paying hospitals. without those and other details, it's difficult to say confidently what impact the regulations would have, given all the moving policy pieces each of these plans entails.
under the stafford act, the president can mobilize federal resources by declaring an emergency or a disaster. and if president trump decided it was in the public's interest to offer free testing and treatment, in part to curb the spread of the disease, he could do so without congress.
jim watson via getty images senator martha mcsally (r-ariz.) is still trying to make voters forget she supported affordable care act repeal and rallied her colleagues to get the fucking thing done.
local democratic parties are confronting a problem in the trump era that is as confounding as it is unexpected: space.
shirley perry was a registered nurse at the medical center who was so proud of working at uva, said her mother, vera perry. she became chronically ill, lost her job and insurance, and then needed treatment from her former employer. uva sued her for $218,730 plus $32,809 in legal fees. she died last year at age 51, with a uva lien on her townhouse. it was auctioned off on aug. 7 at the albemarle county courthouse.
whether trump will back off the mccain jabs now that the senator has died remains to be seen.
even though outright repeal appears to be off the table, there are still efforts to undermine the law. the big gop tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don't get insurance. without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise.
state officials have implemented the affordable care act enthusiastically, using the program's funds to expand medicaid. they have also set up a dedicated state marketplace, where people buying coverage on their own can shop for policies and get federal financial assistance. the managers of the marketplace, known as covered california, have special regulatory authority to negotiate aggressively with insurers over prices and benefit structure.
when trump won, i already knew that he would, in spite of his ugly, sexist comments about grabbing women by their _______, and in spite of his crude and vicious attacks on mexicans, blacks, hillary clinton and so many others. he comes from the same racism that makes me paranoid, every single day of my life, whenever i leave my home, so paranoid that i may never come back alive, that i retreat to grab my wallet, or at least my driver's license, so that i can be properly identified if something should happen to me at the hands of the police or some white racist, specifically, simply for being a black male in america. trump's bravado and racism and sexism may have shaken the very foundation of legions of white liberals, but it was not a surprise to any of us, me, my mother, people like us, who have had to survive this sort of political and emotional and spiritual molestation our entire lives.
however, cassidy has also come under fire for his far more conservative views on women's health, including his votes to defund planned parenthood and his support for restrictions on abortion rights.
several analysts told huffpost that the proposed regulation might allow ahps to adjust premiums based on gender, charging women more than men. but the analysts cautioned that they couldn't be sure of this, because other federal laws might still prohibit that practice.
the chief enforcers of washington decorum ― they usually call themselves centrists ― do not like bipartisanship as such, but only a particular version of bipartisan cooperation. in this milieu, republicans and corporate elites actually get to exercise power, while democrats and liberals must ask very nicely to be allowed to participate in the legislative largesse of their betters. democrats are applauded for playing their allotted role as essentially powerless functionaries with grace and dignity, while republicans get to do almost anything they want.
currently, states receive as much federal medicaid money as it takes to provide benefits for everyone who is eligible. the gop proposal would instead give states a block grant ― a lump sum per person ― and allow each state to decide how to spend it.
kahn said he fears that cuts in reimbursements to nursing homes could lead to more nursing homes just flat-out refusing to take medicaid patients, which some already do.
meanwhile, mcsally and national republicans portrayed kelly as a radical leftist with ties to china, questioning his business dealings and investments in the country. the attack never really stuck, with kelly leading comfortably in polls throughout the campaign.
white house press secretary stephanie grisham did not respond to a huffpost request for comment.
research shows medical care, through therapy, medication or both, is effective in helping to curb mental health issues, but that access to such care is slowly dwindling. that's thanks in part to issues with insurance. a study published in april by nyu's langone medical center found that 10.5 percent of people in 2014 experienced delays in getting treatment due to insufficient mental health coverage, a small rise from the last time data was gathered in 2006.
with 50 seats in the senate and vice president kamala harris as the tie-breaking vote, democrats won't need republican support if they choose to push their covid-19 proposal through reconciliation.
the focus on painting mcconnell as corrupt and obstructionist, on display in early democratic messaging, coincides with efforts by mcconnell's own advisers to portray him as a grim reaper slashing down progressive dreams as he runs for reelection in kentucky. the dual pushes seem likely to ensure that mcconnell's record as the leader of the senate is at the center of the 2020 elections, especially in the states that will ultimately determine who wins a majority of seats in the upper chamber. republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the senate, meaning democrats need to win a net of at least three seats in 2020.
if local reporting and available data are indicative, people aren't generally losing coverage because these people actually failed to meet the work requirement or lack qualifying hardships. instead, they are losing coverage because they had difficulty navigating the complex reporting requirements.
most require members to go agree to a code of conduct before they enroll. this pact requires members to follow christian-supported behavior. they can mean no smoking, limited drinking, and no premarital sex.
as with most medical journals, the authors and contributors have to disclose any conflicts of interest so the readers will have this information as they read the article. for this article, the conflict of interest disclosure sends the reader to a website:
the administration would do so at its own political peril, though, especially with the midterm elections just two months away. as it is, most republicans running for congress are trying desperately to distance themselves from the lawsuit or at least to profess their commitment to protecting people with pre-existing conditions.
a lot of republicans who represent expansion states are going to handle this medicaid issue very delicately, and they're not going to be taking an ideological doctrinaire position, dent said.
the house majority did not wait for a jct staff macroeconomic analysis and instead relied on any private estimate that suited its fancy, wrote the former jct chief kleinbard. the senate essentially did the same.
joe raedle via getty images sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) takes a selfie with (from right) sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.), the late john mccain (r-ariz.) and chris van hollen (d-md.) during president donald trump's inauguration in 2017.
for democrats, the question is what to do next.
so if you start demanding transparency, there will be pressure on hospitals to provide it.
alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing ― and the need to remedy this injustice. she served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.
the house freedom caucus is not the only faction of the republican party responsible for sinking the gop health care proposal. the last-minute exodus of moderate republicans sealed its fate.
on january 22nd, 1973, the supreme court ruled in a 7-2 majority recognizing the right to an abortion as a fundamental human right.
moulton denied that serve america did not endorse james thompson, an army veteran turned civil rights lawyer running in kansas' 4th congressional district, because he is too progressive. in an april 2017 special election for a district that donald trump won by 27 percentage points, thompson held his republican opponent to a 7-point win.
but even clinton's proposal had a wistful feel to it, given that republicans were all but certain to hold one house of congress, blocking anything that smacked of helping obamacare. when clinton lost to trump, it looked like the law's days were numbered, rendering discussion of improvements moot.
and it's not as if those 12.6 million would have coverage equivalent to what's available on healthcare.gov today. the plans would be cheaper, but only because they had big benefit gaps and weren't even available to people with pre-existing conditions. some people would save money, sure — mostly those who are healthy and able to stay that way.
we inherited a broken, obsolete system, trump said sunday, the third straight white house briefing in which he has blamed his administration's slow response to the coronavirus pandemic on obama, even though trump has been in office now a full three years and two months.
the lammers say they attend church, but less often than they would prefer. work and the kids make it shard to find the time. our family has christ in our hearts and in our home, danielle said. unfortunately, making it to a weekly service just doesn't work for us right now, but that doesn't mean we don't believe and have god in our lives.
among their chief complaints were rising premiums, deductibles, copays and drug costs, as well as surprise bills for services they believed were covered and hopelessly complex plans. those with affordable care act plans saw medicaid as a much better deal ... and were resentful that people with incomes lower than theirs could get it. ideally, these focus groups said, their health care plan would focus on keeping their out-of-pocket costs low, control drug prices and improve access to cheaper drugs.
the late senator's daughter, meghan mccain, responded quickly after the quote surfaced and called trump's behavior pathetic and telling.
the never-before-heard recording didn't come to light through a liberal or mainstream news site. rather, the right-wing, nationalist breitbart news published it monday night.
without a formal analysis from the congressional budget office ― and without careful study by outside experts, most of whom hadn't seen the legislation until friday ― it's difficult to say exactly how the law might affect premiums, generosity of coverage, the federal budget or the overall number of people with insurance.
but in a sign of how far the politics surrounding obamacare have shifted, mcconnell vowed this week to restore coverage for people with preexisting conditions should the supreme court uphold the challenge to the law.
washington ― since the affordable care act's passage in 2010, repealing obamacare has been the driving issue for the republican party.
harris would allow private carriers to continue offering medicare advantage plans, which is the private insurance alternative already available to senior citizens in medicare. but under harris' scheme, those medicare advantage plans would not simply be for seniors. anybody could choose to enroll in them.
it's arrogant, elitist, enablers like you that never hold r's accountable that created the opening for trump!! https://t.co/oah1b92pfs — sean hannity (@seanhannity) august 5, 2016
trump's budget follows a familiar formula that exempts seniors from politically toxic cuts to medicare and social security while targeting benefit safety net programs for the poor, domestic programs like clean energy and student loan subsidies. it again proposes to dramatically slash funding for overseas military operations to save $567 billion over 10 years but adds $1.5 trillion over the same time frame to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent law.
notably, the order exempts indoor religious services from the occupancy limit, even though churches are responsible for many of the superspreading events where large numbers of people fall ill. earlier this month, 236 members of a church congregation in eastern oregon became sick after attending services there.
so when democrats talk about the president's budget, they believe that the only thing really stopping him is a democratic majority in the house.
the fifth player, unitedhealth group inc. was not involved in the deals.
the kff poll also finds some misconceptions about how the plan would affect specific groups. compared with current law, lower-income individuals, older adults, and those living in rural areas would pay more for insurance on average under the replacement plan, while younger adults, those with higher incomes, and those living in urban areas would pay less, the authors write. however, the public does not see a distinction in how the replacement plan would impact costs for these different groups of individuals, except when it comes to income.
insurance numbers alone don't prove that the affordable care act has been beneficial. but there's now a large body of research that shows people have better access to care, are less likely to face financial distress from medical bills, and are probably healthier as a result.
advocates for the poor worry the same thing will soon happen in michigan, only on an even larger scale, and that it probably won't stop there.
prior to the trump presidency, moore's most prominent policymaking experience was a disastrous tax experiment in kansas. along with conservative economist art laffer, moore helped then-gov. sam brownback (r) design a program to slash income taxes on the richest families in the state and eliminate taxes altogether for partnerships, llcs, s-corporations and sole proprietorships ― essentially small businesses, but also hedge funds, law firms, doctors, people with book deals and other varieties of wealthy persons.
instructively, each encounter has highlighted a different feature of the past to which we can look forward if republicans steamroll a repeal of the obamacare regulations. first, the insurance company questioned whether the patient's treatment was for a pre-existing condition excluded from coverage. as an athlete, the patient had indeed suffered many injuries. the patient's orthopedist wrote a letter explaining this was a new condition. next, on several occasions, the insurance company claimed it had not received the appropriate documentation of the treatment from the therapists. in trying to address the discrepancies, the patient was often unable to clarify whether the therapists had neglected the paperwork or the insurance company had mislaid the submission. what each made clear, however, was that they would not deal directly with one another: the physical therapist's staff apparently preferred to harass the patient for payment, while the insurance company neither followed up with the provider nor notified the patient of a problem in processing the claim.
when thom tillis had the chance to expand medicaid to get more people health care coverage, a narrator says in an ad from majority forward, a democratic nonprofit group, attacking tillis, he voted no, leaving half a million north carolinians without care.
disappointment, with a side of optimism
as for the leadership of these three pivotal studies, out of the more than 50 authors of the associated published papers, none were african-american men. neither of the iprex studies had a single black author, while just two black women are listed among the prep demo project paper's authors.
the effects would be difficult for courts to sort out
democrats are 46 percentage points likelier than republicans to believe the new plan would decrease the number of people with health insurance, according to the kff poll, 52 points likelier to think the plan would increase costs for people who buy their own insurance, and 44 points likelier to expect higher deductibles.
as the heated debate over obamacare rages on in washington and across the country, we can all seem to agree on at least one thing: health care is complicated.
detroit ― health care dominated the first part of wednesday's democratic presidential debate, just like on tuesday, only this time, the conversation was more cacophonous, disjointed and hostile.
as the evening wound down, the crowd heard from mayville, who traveled back to idaho with his wife, elena mayville, from their home in new york city. (the couple is planning to relocate to idaho eventually.)
per google trends, top questions on joe biden, during the dnc:
that arrangement has mostly worked for people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line, which works out to $62,750 a year for a family of four. for them, the tax credits are so generous that insurance is well within reach ― and sometimes even free! (the ones who have incomes above or just below the poverty line can simply enroll in medicaid, as long as their state has expanded eligibility.)
i think they found three instances from 37 years, he said. if we had those kinds of problems, we wouldn't have high retention rates. and we did.
on that july day [in 1776], our founders declared their independence. but they only declared it; it would take another seven years to win the war. fifteen years to forge a constitution and a bill of rights. nearly 90 years, and a great civil war, to abolish slavery. nearly 150 years for women to win the right to vote. nearly 190 years to enshrine voting rights. and even now, we're still perfecting our union, still extending the promise of america.
the democratic primary is wide open, with former rep. gwen graham, businessman chris king, tallahassee mayor andrew gillum and former miami beach mayor philip levine running.
but the biggest impact on low-wage earners, barthold said, comes from the repeal of the affordable care act's individual mandate, which required americans without health insurance to purchase it or pay a penalty to the internal revenue service. without the mandate, which expires at the end of this year, some taxpayers will choose not to buy health insurance. low-income workers who opt out will lose the tax-credit subsidy the government provided them to help pay for insurance, barthold said. jct tallies the loss of the credit as an increase in net taxes.
two weeks have passed since president donald trump proclaimed he would be signing a big health care reform plan in two weeks. don't hold your breath for a rose garden ceremony.
it's an area of haves and have-nots. we feel like a lot of the have-nots have just been passed by and overlooked, maxson added. building hope for the future is letting them know it is worth it coming out to the polls and that if we don't get them this time, we're getting them next time.
icer calculates a fair benchmark price to the manufacturer, the payer, the patient and the overall health system, so that these decisions can be made collaboratively in full view of you, the patient. these decisions have always been made behind closed doors, so the fact that cost is being addressed and discussed openly provides patients with a significant advantage.
the affordable care act has transformed the u.s. health care system by opening up state medicaid programs to more than 12 million low-income people and offering subsidies to more than 9 million low- and middle-income insurance buyers. the law also imposed new rules protecting people with preexisting conditions, guaranteed a basic minimum set of benefits under private insurance policies and eliminated yearly or lifetime caps on how much medical care insurance will cover. the urban institute projects that throwing out the law would leave 20 million more americans uninsured, a 65% increase.
the republican party is apparently also taking quist seriously. president donald trump's eldest child, donald trump jr., returned to montana last week to campaign for gianforte a second time, and vice president mike pence stumped for him last friday.
we didn't even discuss votes, said rep. chris collins (r-n.y.), one of the biggest boosters for the repeal. this was a plea one-on-one-on-one for the entire conference to come together as a team, to look in the mirror, understand we are the governing body.
house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) released a framework for gop health care legislation last year, but he has never put it into legislative form. the house freedom caucus and the republican study committee, another group of conservative representatives, have competing plans.
but democrats know the clock is ticking and that trying to get gop support could take up too much time. more than 18.2 million americans were claiming jobless benefits as of last week, and federal unemployment insurance programs are set to expire in early march. states and localities are also staring down major budget holes as they attempt to implement mass vaccination programs.
the lawsuit against the aca originally came from 20 republican state officials, but it has trump's support. he instructed the justice department to file briefs supporting it, even though sitting administrations typically defend all federal statutes in court.
it would also end various programs from the law designed to improve patient safety in hospitals, reduce wasteful medicare spending and improve health care quality. calorie counts on chain restaurant menus also would no longer be required.
luke mayville and garrett strizich, both 32, natives of sandpoint in the far north of idaho, founded reclaim idaho last year because they believe state legislators are out of touch with what their constituents actually want.
pressed by blumenthal, kavanaugh once again said he followed supreme court precedent on parental consent provisions in the texas case involving an undocumented teenager who sought an abortion last fall. the teen followed state law in the case, obtaining permission from a judge in lieu of parental consent. kavanaugh's opponents say his suggestion that the teen first consult an immigration sponsor before deciding on the abortion was unfair and harmful.
i still had another year of medical school and i received a scholarship to go to the harvard t.h. chan school of public health. i left pennsylvania and headed to massachusetts. the experience was eye opening in many ways, including the discovery that i love epidemiology and public health.
insurance commissioners aren't just worried about surprise bills for people who get short-term plans. they also worry about insurance markets becoming less stable. one possibility is that insurers will develop new policies that look more like affordable care act ― just enough to attract people who want comprehensive coverage ― while still leaving out key benefits and selling only to people in good health.
he has shifted the democratic party against doing more trade and investment deals, scott said.
the big dynamic of tonight's debate on health: the candidates obviously felt it was in their interest to take the bait from moderators to attack each other on health not trump. the likely result: most voters were probably confused by all the details. — drew altman (@drewaltman) august 1, 2019
win mcnamee/reuters president bill clinton escorts his newly named supreme court nominee, judge ruth bader ginsburg, from the podium following the rose garden announcement on june 14, 1993.
trump failed to note, however, that his administration has spent years seeking to repeal obamacare even after congress, then controlled by republicans in both chambers, failed to do so in 2017.
and yet ― these efforts might not have such a big effect if the coverage available under the affordable care act were more affordable in the first place. for many americans, it hasn't been. one reason is the decisions democrats made when they wrote the law.
republicans can only blame themselves for this state of affairs. after first occasionally standing up to trump post-election, they've completely thrown their lot in with him, fearful of their shrinking party's trump-loving base. (the gop now represents only about one-fourth of voters, according to recent surveys, declining since the 2016 election.)
during the campaign, his willingness to criticize a lot of neoliberal approaches was something i found very refreshing, said julius krein, founder of the conservative magazine american affairs and an early intellectual cheerleader for trump who became an outspoken critic during the first year of his presidency. as president, there has been a lot more conventional republican, market fundamentalist policy.
as in other states, democrats saw dramatic shifts in suburban support as a key to victory, especially in johnson county, which sits just across the border from kansas city, missouri. but it wasn't enough to end a kansas cold streak that is now nearly a century long, leaving the party's hopes of a senate majority hanging on races in much friendlier territory.
barkley's court often handles 300 uva suits in a week, data shows.
the real, unfunded cost of uva indigent care: $4.3 million, or 1.3% of what it claims, according to the document.
we did it! resistance works, derailing the destruction of the aca, at least for now. keep it up! — earl blumenauer (@repblumenauer) march 24, 2017
unable to pay this balance, but believing that the therapist had been entitled to his insurance payment, the former patient undertook to determine why the insurance company did not pay the claim. fast forward to the end of this tale: the claim remains unpaid, the provider continues to harass the former patient, and the former patient's effort to address the matter has consumed countless hours of his time over more than a year.
that sleight of hand enables trump to promise to whittle down a $1.08 trillion budget deficit for the ongoing budget year and a $966 billion deficit gap in the 2021 fiscal year starting oct. 1 to $261 billion in 2030. balance would come in 15 years.
newly jobless people also may be eligible for medicaid coverage, which is cost-free in most cases.
as a result, the outcome of the lawsuit is likely to remain unknown when americans go to the polls, even though the case is part of a decadelong battle between the nation's two political parties ― and even though a ruling in favor of the lawsuit would unleash chaos while directly affecting literally tens of millions of americans.
meehan admitted writing the staffer a letter professing himself her soul mate after he learned she was in a serious relationship. he turned hostile when she didn't reciprocate, the woman said in a complaint last year.
jayapal is a leader of a medicare for all house caucus that had 78 members as of late november and, with an infusion of newly elected democrats, should soon have more. the new bill will be similar to one she co-sponsored in the last congress, which in turn was similar to a bill sanders introduced in the senate.

one year later, the vote and the quote have become political liabilities. mcsally's opponent, house democrat krysten sinema, cites them constantly as proof that mcsally would leave some people with cancer, diabetes and other conditions unable to get coverage.
the last time there was a competitive race to be the democratic presidential nominee, in 2008, just one candidate called for the creation of a national, single-payer health care program that would replace the private health insurance system: then-rep. dennis kucinich (d-ohio).
republican front-runner donald trump is going to work something out on health care after he dismantles obamacare, he said sunday. he didn't say what exactly that something will be -- but the real estate mogul said he's going to have it under control.
trump again touted a, quote, record 9 million job gain over the past three months. he didn't mention, as usual, that that gain follows a record 22 million job loss over the previous two months.
ernst's comments were followed an hour later by montana gop sen. steve daines arguing it was unlikely the court would strike down the affordable care act because of a lawsuit he has long supported.
but the two circuit judges said they weren't so sure the rest of the law had to go. they sent the case back to o'connor with instructions to go back through the affordable care act to see if maybe some parts can remain.
her confirmation, which looks all but certain in the gop-controlled senate, would solidify a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court for the foreseeable future.
but the correlation makes perfect sense given that places where covid-19 is now hitting hardest are predominantly rural counties in the dakotas, montana, iowa and wisconsin ― in other words, some of the most politically conservative pockets of the u.s. where trump has always been most popular.
trump's record : repeal and don't replace
congress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions. ... it repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place. five legal scholars, in a new brief urging courts to reject the latest aca lawsuit
they'll give you a pass on this one, biden told obama, according to jonathan alter's book the promise. another account of the administration's first year, noam scheiber's the escape artists, confirmed the story, noting that at a january 2009 meeting, the vice president begged obama to make his early presidency about jobs.
with readler's confirmation, trump has now gotten 33 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two supreme court justices confirmed. the number of confirmed circuit judges is more than any other president has achieved by this point in his first term, and represents one out of every six seats on those courts.
schachtner said she knew of plenty of folks who voted for trump; but they told her they backed her because they knew and trusted her. she didn't talk about walker or trump in her race.

republican policies don't back up republican promises
it would then be up to democrats whether they would give in to trump's demands or gamble that voters will just blame republicans for the collapse of the insurance market and, perhaps, a government shutdown.
bloomberg / getty images amy mcgrath, a former marine, won the democratic nomination for kentucky's 6th congressional district with moulton's support.
no matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
frequently, that means buying short-duration health insurance plans, which several major carriers sell and which typically last just three months (although some insurers package them in bundles so they last for a year). designed as stopgaps for brief but predictable lapses in coverage, they've become increasingly popular among people seeking a less expensive alternative to obamacare ― although, like the ministries, short-duration plans are cheaper because they offer less coverage and include a variety of pre-existing restrictions.
carolyn kaster/associated press sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.), chairman of the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, with jurisdiction over the affordable care act, said last year: i am not aware of a single senator who said they were voting to repeal obamacare when they voted to eliminate the individual mandate penalty.
the trump administration has taken a different attitude, approving seven such applications, including michigan's, with another eight now pending.
as we age, we have more health issues. this often results in two forces pulling you in conflicting directions. on the one hand, you are reluctant to leave your job because of the health coverage it provides and your increasing need for it. but on the other hand, having health issues reminds you that you really want to have some healthy good years to enjoy yourself once you stop work.
by that time, the law itself could look different, depending on who runs the white house and congress and what action, if any, they've taken to modify the statute or further reform health care.
if the judges decide those democrats don't have the authority to defend the affordable care act in court, it's not clear who would be able to fight the lawsuit or what that would mean for the case.
that means harris, like all the democrats running for president, is pushing in a very different direction than president donald trump and his republican allies, whose ongoing efforts to repeal obamacare would take away coverage from millions and probably tens of millions of americans.
the american health care act, as republicans are calling it, would allow insurers to make premiums for older americans five times what they charge younger workers ― provided that a state's regulations allow for it. obamacare had capped this ratio, known as an age rating, at 3 to 1.
and then there's what heretofore had been the only tangible element to trump's health care agenda: allowing health insurance companies to sell policies across state lines. this, too, is a very old conservative reform idea.
let's start with what's not in trumpcare, apart from estimates of how much it would cost and how it would affect the health care system. he seems to have no notion about covering the uninsured -- there are no tax credits or new government programs to help the millions who, without the substantial financial assistance that obamacare offers, could never afford decent coverage on their own.
voters may understand that part. president donald trump had to reckon with the realities of governing when, after passing an obamacare repeal dozens of times when there was a democratic president in control of the white house, republicans couldn't repeal the law when it came time to do it for real.
and when huffpost raised the point that some members just may not feel like they're being heard right now, khanna had simple advice.
we're going on the road to hold members accountable for their votes, said sister simone campbell, the executive director of the network lobby for catholic social justice and a member of the sisters of social service. when republicans in congress passed their tax plan into law last fall, we knew it was rooted in the fallacy of trickle-down economics. now, we've seen the results of structuring tax policy to favor the biggest corporations and the wealthiest individuals in our nation.
correction: an earlier version of this story did not specify that women on web and plan c do not ship abortion medications within the united states, only to countries where abortion is illegal. the story has been corrected.
friend and supporter ruddy thinks trump, for whatever reason, believes he must hold onto the 30 percent or so of americans who fervently support him, no matter the cost.
so what would republicans do instead? at the moment, nobody can say for sure, because they are still arguing among themselves over some pretty basic design questions. moderates talk of repair as much as replace, while conservatives are determined to tear the law down entirely ― and then put little or nothing in its stead.
the congressional budget office works independently of leadership in congress to analyze the costs and effects of legislation. congress for decades has relied on its scores when drafting and debating bills.
jonathan cohn/huffpost rep. rosa delauro is especially proud of how her proposal would enhance medicare benefits for seniors.
coffman decided to let only four people into the room at a time, yielding images on social media that looked like this:
but kavanaugh told senators during his confirmation hearing on wednesday that he could not comment on that case because it is still pending.
and we see loads of opportunities and, quite frankly, loads of threats. if i look at what sprinkle care [a medicaid buy-in proposal] was in nevada last year, if i look at what's potentially going to be on the ballot in washington state, if i look at what potentially virginia's going to be considering, if i look at what new mexico is trying to do ― if we can get some of those things done in the short term, then they can be helpful to the longer term.
for a radical overhaul, for a true disruption, there's really only one possible actor: the federal government. that's something warren buffett, the chairman of berkshire hathaway, understands. just last year, he argued that government-run health insurance probably is the best system. but conservatives in congress often backed by influential business leaders have not allowed the federal government to bring about that result.
when i started researching the book, i knew the outcome ― prices are really high compared to the rest of the world, and our outcomes are worse ― and i wanted to know how we got to this crazy place that the patients hate and the doctors hate. i found that there was a long chain of events over decades ― decisions that looked smart when they were made, and good ideas that got perverted when the profit motive came into play.
joe kernen: ―to do some of the things that you said you wouldn't do in the past, though, in terms of medicare―
after calamitous death panel claims, he takes on the crowd.
basically, democrats believe there should be a right to decent, affordable insurance. they wrote the affordable care act with that principle in mind. democrats didn't achieve their goal ― millions of americans remain uninsured, while millions more with coverage still face high costs. but something like 20 million people now have comprehensive policies they didn't have before. overall, financial security and access to health care have improved.
for all of the affordable care act's shortcomings and despite the public's decidedly mixed feelings about it, people overwhelmingly supported the new protections for pre-existing conditions and the expansion of insurance ― through both medicaid and subsidized private coverage ― that had put medical care within reach for millions.
so far, mueller has been very careful to deprive them of that talking point. under his interpretation of legal opinions by the justice department's office of legal counsel and doj guidelines, it would be fundamentally unfair to say trump would be charged with a crime if he wasn't president, because without a court proceeding trump would have no formal venue to defend himself.
president donald trump instructed house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) on friday to postpone a planned vote on the american health care act after it became clear republicans did not have the votes to pass the bill.
ventures that try to get beyond partisanship are almost a kind of cottage industry in d.c. no labels is probably the best example. many people would argue that those ventures either die a natural death or they stick around but don't have a major effect on the policy conversation. why is your venture different?
but in making this case, biden drew that toxic and misleading analogy to republicans. i knew the republicans would do everything in their power to try and repeal obamacare, biden said in an email to supporters. but i'm surprised that so many democrats are running on getting rid of it. biden also made a point of addressing seniors specifically, warning darkly that the transition from existing medicare to medicare for all might leave them unable to get critical, life-saving treatments.
we're not starting from a very good place, says eli rosenberg, phd, an assistant professor of public health at emory university in atlanta, reflecting on the initial demographic patterns of prep use.

correction: a previous version of this article said cornyn tried to secure votes to repeal the aca in 2007. he did so in 2017.
the only reason it failed is because a number of republicans felt that it did not do enough damage, ellison said in a statement friday. however, they will try again. democrats, grassroots activists, and millions of americans who don't want to lose their coverage must be ready to mobilize like never before.
note to our readers: donald trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the u.s.
almost by definition, the people likely to lose coverage already have some combination of financial and medical problems, and without coverage, both are likely to get worse. it's not clear how much this worries bevin and his allies in washington ― or whether it worries them at all.
warren doesn't dismiss the importance of building a grassroots movement, and she paid homage to the civil rights and suffrage movements during her own speech at the we the people summit. but her focus, shown by her eagerness to discard the filibuster and her focus on limiting the influence of lobbyists and money in politics, is on altering washington's playing field.
jorjani was also asked why he'd overturned multiple legal opinions by previous solicitors, actions that suggested his political ideology overtook basically the rule of law, according to sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), the committee's ranking democrat.
anthem is the largest member of the blue cross blue shield association and operates bcbs plans in 14 states. it and said it could apply its discounts to cigna members while cigna said its collaborations with doctors would save money.
trump hasn't changed his tune much since then. republicans will be providing far better healthcare than the democrats, at a far lower cost...and will always protect people with pre-existing conditions!!!! he posted on twitter oct. 13.
oh, and he's a climate denier!
democrats officially nominated joe biden to be their party's presidential nominee on tuesday and made the case that he can unify the country because he appeals to virtually every type of voter: progressives, moderates and disaffected republicans.
in arizona, gop sen. martha mcsally has made multiple statements along the same lines, including a boast in a campaign ad that, i will always protect those with preexisting conditions ― always. this is the same mcsally who, as a house member in 2017, famously rallied her colleagues to vote yes on repeal by telling the caucus it was time to get this fucking thing done.
the affordable care act was passed 10 years ago.
but the reason the ministries are so much cheaper is they aren't subject to many of the aca's requirements, even though having a membership in one provides an exemption from paying the individual mandate penalty, which remains in force until 2019.
since the affordable care act subsidies became available in 2014, they've allowed lucas to not only get coverage he could afford, but also cut back on how many jobs he takes so he can give his body a rest after decades of working a tough job. this year, he's paying $94 a month for his insurance after the subsidies, and he's happy with the coverage.
the state gop officials brought the lawsuit shortly after congress in 2017 eliminated the fines associated with the affordable care act's individual mandate that most u.s. residents have health coverage or pay tax penalties. citing a 2012 supreme court ruling that the mandate was a constitutional exercise in congress' right to levy taxes, the plaintiffs contend that the lack of fines ― that is, taxes ― renders the mandate itself unconstitutional. furthermore, the republicans cite the justice department's claims under then-president barack obama that the mandate is so essential to the law's functioning that the entire statute must be struck down if the mandate were.
uva sues so many patients that district court judge william barkley doesn't announce the cases as he takes the bench each thursday in the historic brick courthouse in charlottesville. on this day, he waves a thick stack of litigation at defendants, asking, is anybody here for a hospital case? nobody needs to ask which hospital.
when khan stood up at the dnc, did he fully realize the impact that his speech would have? khan, a trained attorney, was likely no stranger to public speaking. but that small and heated gesture of waiving the pocket constitution at the crowds (and metaphorically at trump) had impact. it's become a sort-of campaign symbol or slogan for hillary's campaign.
usually it's brokers, not state regulators, that people consult when considering whether to join a ministry. many brokers sell them happily ― sometimes taking large commissions, though it depends on the ministry.
he wants to blame everybody but himself, said norman ornstein, a scholar with the conservative-leaning american enterprise institute. but we know that every action he took, including disbanding the pandemic unit, was to do the opposite of what obama did.
the topic is likely to come up again and, when it does, republicans are sure to cite california's decision as indicative of what democrats want to do in the rest of the country.
the roe decision led new york's numbers to plummet, as abortion was universally available almost overnight. but in the years since, state legislatures have put various limits on access. in new york there have been no new restrictions since 1973; in many other states there are now barriers such as waiting periods, two-trip requirements, parental permission and legal requirements that have forced many clinics to close.
but what democrats are defining as unity — their theme for the democratic national convention this week — is also reflective of the fragile coalition biden is hoping to pull together against president donald trump.
at the last meeting of the women's caucus of the monroe county democratic party ― normally a sparsely attended affair ― people spilled out the door onto the street. for the party's upcoming reorganization meeting, county chairman mark fraley said they're looking for a new venue, because the courthouse room that had always been more than sufficient is now too small. if they can't find a new room, he said, they'll put speakers outside the door so the spillover crowd can still hear. democrats here have seen such an outpouring of new members, they're on track to raise enough money to hire an executive director for the first time.
i think this administration's actions on poverty and on birth control are beyond anything i have seen in the past, said haskins, who previously crafted welfare policy for republicans as a staffer on capitol hill and in the white house.
the poll, paid for by the democratic campaign finance reform group end citizens united, surveyed 1,200 voters across twelve presidential battleground states. the initial result found democrats with a 3 percentage point advantage on a generic ballot for congress. after being exposed to messaging about mcconnell, the democratic advantage grew to 12 percentage points. that was more effective than messages about president donald trump (6 percentage points) or congressional republicans overall (9 percentage points).

the big democratic names are still coming — former president barack obama visited later in the week, and former vice president joe biden was in the state on tuesday. but evers and wisconsin democrats don't mind that their candidate, wisconsin's 66-year-old superintendent of public instruction, isn't the center of attention.

barnes finally got clean, after a few months. she also started getting treatment for her chronic conditions that had been making it difficult for her to work. i wasn't even dealing with my diabetes because i didn't have insurance to pay for it, she said.
nebraska is not the only place where this is happening. iowa and tennessee are among the states where the insurance markets are evolving in a similar manner. thanks to a combination of factors, some related to the design of the affordable care act and some related to the way hostile republican officials have implemented it, the underlying cost of comprehensive coverage has risen dramatically in these places.
health policy experts have found that the net effect of the republican repeal bill would be to raise costs for the average insurance enrollee by $1,542 per year in 2017, and by $2,409 in 2020.
your point is an excellent one, which is not one the united states of care is in any way in opposition to, which is to say: what are the best ideas? what are the simplest ideas? what are the ones that make the most sense? i think it would be completely wrong to characterize the united states of care to be against something that has those kinds of features.
trump's u.s.-mexico border wall would receive a $2 billion appropriation, more than provided by congress but less than the $8 billion requested last year. trump has enough wall money on hand to build 1000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of wall, a senior administration official said, most of it obtained by exploiting his budget transfer powers. the official requested anonymity to discuss the budget before it is made public.
her vote to call witnesses could save face back home in maine where 71% of voters said senators should insist on introducing new documents and witnesses during the trial, according to a poll conducted by the garin hart yang research group and released last month. a recent cnn poll found maine voters were split on whether trump should be removed from office, however.
it is unclear what system trump was referring to. his administration's failure to aggressively ramp up coronavirus testing in early february and prepare hospitals for a surge of critical respiratory cases, experts said, was largely due to his own attempts to downplay the virus to avoid hurting the stock market and, in turn, his own reelection.
q: so what's not to like?
and under the harris plan, the government would regulate the medicare advantage plans more tightly than it does today and reimburse them at rates closer to independent estimates of their actual costs. if they want to play by our rules, they can be in the system, harris said of the private insurers. if not, they have to get out.
tonight, i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
but congress reduced the financial penalty to zero when it wrote the 2017 tax cut bill that trump signed in december. the plaintiffs say that decision renders the mandate unconstitutional, since the supreme court had upheld it only as a tax. and with no mandate in place, the plaintiffs say, the court must strike down the elements of the affordable care act that depend on it.
yuri gripas/reuters sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) continues to promote his single-payer plan. but this week he endorsed more incremental reforms, as well.
the trump administration's contempt for obamacare is no secret. and although the president and his supporters have sometimes said they believe in protections for people with pre-existing conditions, they have repeatedly taken action ― like trying to pass repeal legislation or rolling back the affordable care act's regulations on what plans must cover ― that seek to undermine or obliterate those protections entirely.
trump, in fact, claimed all the people who work for him are having these tremendous problems, per reid j. epstein of the wall street journal.
for now, the law relies on women who know their rights and are willing to come forward. after a complaint was filed against the diner paula's pancake house, in solvang, california, an investigator found that five nursing mothers employed there had not been accommodated under the law, as well as another worker at a sister property. one worker said managers described pumping breaks as a burden to the restaurant, and said workers should not bother coming back to work unless they are not breastfeeding anymore. another said managers rolled their eyes to show their irritation at requests for breaks.
the big unanswered question is who and how to decide on the cost effectiveness of health care services-- market interests and politics driven by money vs. science and evidence. we have seen how poorly the first approach works. we can look to science-based models around the world for better examples, such as the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) in the united kingdom. in this country, sooner than later, we need an independent, non-partisan, science-based national commission, free from political influence, funded on a long-term basis, and with authority to recommend coverage and reimbursement policies in the public interest. it would logically be part of single-payer financing reform with national health insurance coupled with a private delivery system. as we finally deal with this important issue, we should heed this advice by sir michael rawlins, chairman of nice:
wesley josephson, 14, was born with strabismus, a condition that limits muscle control over one of his eyes. before the affordable care act, no health insurance company would offer his family a policy that covered treatment for his eyes. that changed in 2010, when the law's provision forbidding insurers from rejecting or limiting coverage for children with preexisting conditions took effect.
every republican agrees we're going to protect preexisting conditions, sen. ted cruz (r-texas) said on cnbc last month. one hundred out of 100 senators agree we're going to protect preexisting conditions regardless of what happens with obamacare.
he's been saying this for four years, biden responded. show us. just show us. stop playing around.
i was recently reading a july issue of the journal of the american medical association (jama) when a special communication written by barack obama, j.d., caught my eye (jama; published online july 11, 2016). it was the first article i had ever read in a medical journal that was written by a president of the united states. jama is a much respected medical journal which usually presents peer-reviewed articles relating to medical research. however, the journal will publish special commentaries written by experts relating to timely medical issues.
sen. josh hawley (r-mo.), an outspoken conservative who vowed to support only supreme court nominees who think roe was wrongly decided, said last week that barrett would meet his standard on abortion.
some will call this plan a single-payer proposal, because it's easy to imagine, someday, everybody being part of this new version of medicare. some will say it's not a single-payer proposal, because it envisions a permanent, potentially large role for private insurance ― as a provider of highly regulated plans that would function more or less the way private plans for seniors on medicare operate today.
chelsea clinton also hammered the candidate on tuesday over health care, saying he would dismantle obamacare, dismantle the [children's health insurance program], dismantle medicare and dismantle private insurance.
booker needed to have a good night. he had a great night. the senator from new jersey hit all his marks, walloped biden over his record on racial issues and deportations, and did it all disarmingly with his trademark sunny disposition. the big question for booker, however, is whether his strong performance wednesday will be enough to launch him into the top tier of candidates after struggling for months to gain traction in the polls.
where the democrats differ is over how far to go in these directions ― and how quickly.
blitz, now 37, was born with aortic valve stenosis, meaning one of his heart valves is too narrow. he had a replacement valve implanted in 1999 that was supposed to last 15 years, and time was running out to replace it.
i ran on repealing obamacare. it doesn't repeal obamacare. it creates a giant obamacare superfund. i can't be for that. sen. rand paul (r-ky.)
the questioning grew tense after trump interrupted to dispute claims that the aca, also known as obamacare, had already protected those with preexisting conditions.
and if a repeal vote looks dead in the senate, it would certainly scare republicans in the house.
siino showed up at the fishkill apartment complex over memorial day weekend, dry-cleaned shirts hanging in the back of his audi a5. on tuesday, he was still there. and mekelburg was still tweeting. she raved about jihadi rape gangs and threw her support behind tommy robinson, a far-right, anti-muslim, violent british criminal who was arrested last week for contempt of court after livestreaming about muslim paedophiles outside a gang rape trial in leeds, england. she defended roseanne barr after barr tweeted racist and islamophobic comments and anti-semitic lies.
and even as the trump administration continues to support its healthy adult opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the medicaid program amid the outbreak. the centers for medicare and medicaid services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.
of course, oral arguments can be deceiving, as bagley pointed out. in march 2012, observers of the first big legal challenge to obamacare walked out of the supreme court convinced it was doomed. three months later, the law mostly survived on a carefully worded, 5-4 vote in which chief justice john roberts joined the four democratic appointees.
it is a hugely important signaling move, said katherine hempstead of the nonpartisan robert wood johnson foundation. the administration is doing more than having open enrollment here, they're saying they want to make this coverage more affordable.
ultimate effects of a ruling could be devastating
as thune put it, at some point we need to vote, and so that day of reckoning will come.
joni ernst walks in to deafening chant of your last term! that overpowers the applause pic.twitter.com/wc9tkh31cz — iowa starting line (@iastartingline) february 21, 2017
newsom, inslee and de blasio all support the implementation of a national, government-run single-payer health care system, but that's not the focus of this round of policy proposals.
correction: a previous version of this story indicated jayapal's medicare for all bill had not yet been released.
the fact that his new bill has attracted support from many other senators, including presidential front-runners, is a sign that politicians are really starting to listen to the people, adam gaffney, president of physicians for a national health plan, said. it's an encouraging development, though obviously large obstacles lie ahead.
the final rule is clearly an end-run around the aca, bates wrote.
but that's also not to say he shouldn't do it. romney may only be driven by self-interest. but if he does primary donald trump, all americans will have a self-interest in that too.
i can't imagine you will ever make such a choice. that this is the only choice you have makes it imperative to leave the gop.
the budget newsom unveiled thursday offered up a bunch of goodies for young children and their parents, including a plan for statewide universal pre-k and all-day kindergarten, as well as more money for subsidized child care. he also announced an increase in benefits to undocumented immigrants. it was an astonishing contrast to the policy priorities of the trump administration.
predicting the effects of large policy changes is always difficult, but cbo's predictions for the aca in 2010 were much more accurate than the predictions of many republican opponents of the law. for example, cbo correctly predicted that employer-sponsored insurance would not drop sharply, correctly predicted roughly the current level of exchange premiums, over (not under!) estimated the cost of the subsidies to the federal government, and correctly predicted that insurance coverage would jump upward.
the supreme court will hear the latest challenge to the affordable care act but almost certainly not until its next term, which begins in october.
back in 2017, kenny told huffpost that he was pleasantly surprised by the policies available on healthcare.gov. kenny had lost his previous insurance policy because the insurer discontinued it, but he found a plan that had better coverage than his old plan at just $50 more a month.
can you imagine the lack of compassion it takes to argue that 130 million americans, with cancers, respiratory ailments, all the way down to asthma, don't deserve the guarantee of affordable health care? asked senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.). it's going to be remembered, this vote, for a long time. a long, long time.
republicans came close to sending a bill to trump's desk repealing obamacare in 2017 but came up a few votes short in the senate. the alternative most gop senators rallied around at the time, known as graham-cassidy, would have effectively ended obamacare's insurance protections, according to health policy experts, leading people with pre-existing conditions to face higher premiums. it also would have left tens of millions more americans without health insurance.
texas attorney general ken paxton and a group of other state republican officials filed their lawsuit in february 2018, and u.s. district judge reed o'connor in fort worth, texas, ruled in their favor in december 2018.
the most ambitious reform plans that democrats and their allies have floated, including medicare for all, would not only give everybody coverage. they would reduce or effectively eliminate copays and deductibles.
o'connor agreed, and found that the rest of the law could not be separated from the mandate, meaning it must be struck down entirely.
here's a quick rundown of the research:
rand corporation a breakdown of how the new york health act, a state-level version of medicare for all, would affect people within different income groups, based on a rand corporation analysis.
this year, he sided with the four liberal justices in extending workplace protections to lgbtq employees. he also wrote the 5-4 decision that blocked the trump administration from rescinding the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, keeping nearly 650,000 undocumented young people safe from deportation for at least a while longer.
there is a real person, however, behind the bio. the headshot is real, if dated. and the twitter handle, surprisingly, differs little from her actual name: amy jane mekelburg.
democrat brynne kennedy, who launched a software business and has become an author, is running on the national debt, health care and the climate crisis. the district has long been a conservative stronghold; republicans still have a voter registration advantage over democrats. but in some counties, that's shifting, and there are a fair number of independent voters as well. it's a race democrats see as a possibility — especially in a big election year.
and although sanders on wednesday will cite independent studies showing that a medicare for all system could actually result in the u.s. spending less money on health care, those studies assume savings from simplified billing and lower payments to health care providers that, some experts worry, might not materialize as planned.
this is a private site that also allows you to shop for obamacare plans at no additional cost. you can speak to an expert who can help advise you on the appropriate plan. you can also search for other types of health insurance.
the goal of the new york city plan is to promise access to health coverage and health care services to all of the city's 8.6 million residents, de blasio said.
that objection would apply just as forcefully today and it's unclear why republican senators who felt that way in january would be more inclined to support it now, particularly since polls show the public is becoming more and more opposed to repeal and less and less interested in getting rid of obamacare.
and in massachusetts, democrats have had hegemonic control for years. the few republicans in the state government are largely moderates in the mold of gov. charlie baker.
the supreme court plans to hear the case on nov. 10.
warren's speech on ending the filibuster, delivered to the national action network, focused on how conservatives have used it to block progressive goals for decades, going back to how segregationists used it to block a bill to make lynching a federal crime in 1922.
as the white house asserts a legal argument that treats the president as a monarch, do we really have faith that this supreme court will push back if and when this argument reaches them? i sure don't. and if justice anthony kennedy steps down ― rumors are escalating ― and trump appoints a new justice, all bets are off.
by the time of the 2008 presidential campaign, universal coverage was back in the party lexicon, and the most ambitious idea getting serious attention was a proposed scheme of expanded medicaid, tax credits and new insurance rules that advocates hoped would reach most of the uninsured. the three democratic front-runners, obama and then-sens. hillary clinton and john edwards, had called for versions of that approach. biden had not.
in reality, hawley and other republicans have no concrete or well-developed plan for replacing the law with something that would provide the same kind of access. if either the lawsuit he supports or repeal legislation were successful, people with cancer, diabetes and a variety of other chronic conditions would have a much tougher time getting comprehensive coverage. the gop, including hawley, is now talking up a senate bill experts have said wouldn't solve the problem.
in idaho and the healthcare.gov states, people seeking to replace job-based health insurance must first apply for the right to shop for coverage. this requires documentation from a former employer or former insurer verifying that the previous coverage has ended or is ending soon. people trying to enroll in an exchange policy or an affordable care act-compliant plan directly from an insurer have 60 days from the date they lose coverage to complete a new enrollment under these rules.
the movement hails collins as a hero. planned parenthood gave her its barry goldwater award in 2017 for gop members of congress who champion reproductive health care issues and who fight to ensure the rights granted to women.
this is no time for indifference, the self-indulgence of third-party voting that only aids republicans, or reflexive loyalty to a principled republican party that no longer exists. the gop's toxic compound of ethno-nationalism and moral bankruptcy mandates that independents, democrats and responsible republicans of all backgrounds and generations unite by voting to deprive this aberrant party of its congressional majority ― and to check an american president transparently in vladimir putin's thrall.
neil j. young is a historian and the author of we gather together: the religious right and the problem of interfaith politics. he hosts the history podcast past present.
i've kind of given you my position on it. it's not something i'm pursuing, he said.
honestly, i feel i had no choice at this point, gaffigan wrote in a lengthy facebook post. i think trump is ruining and possibly has already ruined my country.
no, verrilli said flatly, because in that circumstance... the only option that that employee has is to buy an individual policy on the exchange. and that individual policy will contain the contraceptive coverage from your regular doctor as part of your regular health care.
republicans in the u.s. senate don't appear to be sweating the likelihood of such a scenario, however. some are pinning their hopes on the courts to reject the challenge, which is backed by the trump administration, on the grounds that it isn't serious and is legally moot.
trump's comments came at what was billed as the first cabinet meeting of 2019. instead, trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former defense secretary james mattis' performance and the late sen. john mccain's vote against trump's repeal of obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for russia to invade afghanistan again.
there has to be that radical revolution of values martin luther king jr. spoke of in this nation, where people come first, not power and privilege; where there is opportunity for all people, not career moves and relationships that only benefit a few; a revolution where people matter more than things, where people matter more than sporting events, where we do not continue to prop up symbols that do not translate into justice for all.
it's easy to lose coverage, said karen pollitz, a senior fellow at the henry j. kaiser family foundation. not so to put it back.
all of this has led grayson to be characterized as the left wing's trump in a piece in the atlantic. new york magazine called his senate bid the second-strangest campaign of the season.
associated press when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell won reelection in 2014, it was left to then-vice president joe biden to swear him in. if biden wins the presidency, mcconnell will be his biggest obstacle to policy victories.
sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) said democrats have only begun to grill kavanaugh about his views on health care and abortion.
barrett said a president's ability to pardon himself has never been tested in court and the question calls out for legal analysis. she said, it's not one that i can offer a view.
in 2012, facing a much different electorate, romney promptly abandoned that stance and called for defunding planned parenthood to win the evangelical-heavy republican presidential primaries. he can't be trusted, an ad supporting romney's rival newt gingrich argued that year.
the case was seen as a long shot at first, given how little even conservative scholars thought of its merits. but judge o'connor in texas sided with the gop officials and the trump administration when he decided last december that the entire law is unconstitutional, setting up the new appeals court ruling.
washington ― provisions in the house republicans' obamacare replacement bill that would raise insurance costs for older americans are drawing resistance from the influential seniors' lobby.
who knows what things? i wrote. you do need somewhat of a shared value structure, but there will be variances there. i don't need a replica of me, i'm already here.
as the primary process moves toward a welcome conclusion, the fault lines within the democratic party are now registering on the richter scale. the party leadership which has leaned decisively in the direction of the clinton campaign finds itself exacerbating the situation and sanders supporters are feeling increasingly disenfranchised by a process which is, depending on the rules for any given state, uneven and not sufficiently inclusive especially in terms of the large numbers of independent, young and first time voters energized by the sanders campaign. the critical challenge facing hillary clinton and the democratic party is how to best bring sanders political revolutionaries into the party going forward.
the biggest factor pointing toward an agreement to expedite the case, she said, is that there are four liberals on the court now. that could change in two or three years. plus, it's uncertain if the chief justice will remain as a swing vote.
polls have shown a surprisingly competitive race in recent weeks, with graham holding a single-digit lead or tied with harrison. even a narrow loss for harrison would be an impressive feat; graham won his last reelection contest by more than 15 points.
but would it? would a post-roe world look like a pre-roe world, or have changes in medicine, technology and culture since 1973 permanently changed the landscape? in the weeks since kavanaugh's nomination, abortion rights advocates have found themselves pondering those questions with new intensity. they agree that while the coat hanger is a powerful symbol it does not reflect the complexity of a possible next abortion chapter.
but the underlying arguments from the two are actually the same. whatever middle-class americans ended up paying into a new medicare for all system, sanders and warren say, it would be less than what they pay for the current system in the form of private health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs and lost wages.
i was at dinner with paula, one of my dearest friends from way back, i mean way back to shoulder pads and duster earrings. we'd sold pagers together (yes, remember those?). she is a heart friend -- the kind who flies across the country on two days' notice, because i was leaving a broken marriage from someone i had loved very much and she knew i did not need to be alone. and besides being a woman of deep heart, loyalty, authenticity and wisdom, paula is also an uber foodie, epicurean and wine connoisseur, my go-to when i need to pick out a bottle or a glass.
meadows has remained in frequent contact with trump ever since, and he was a major defender of the president during the impeachment trial.
president donald trump isn't waiting for congress to repeal the affordable care act.
it's president donald trump's health care system now. the question is: what's he going to do with it?
the fix is in, brad woodhouse, executive director of health care group protect our care, said in a statement. if anyone still thinks that trump's position in the texas case and the nomination of judge kavanaugh to the court is simply a coincidence - drop me a line - i have some ocean front property for you in kansas.
i mean, everyone wants to be at the table. but you can't make a table that has 435 chairs very easily, he said.
washington — after seven weeks of downplaying the threat of a looming pandemic, president donald trump has gone back to a favorite well: blaming his predecessor, barack obama.
kantar media/cmag data for huffpost american action network is the biggest anti-obamacare ad spender this cycle.
it also renews attacks trump began against obama soon after the u.s. intelligence community revealed in january 2017 that russian dictator vladimir putin had wanted trump to win the presidency and had ordered russian intelligence services to help him do so.
ocasio-cortez ― one of the most outspoken advocates for medicare for all ― said she thought voters understood there was an inherent check on the president's ability to actually change things like our health care system. and she argued that the realities of governing were actually an argument for someone like sanders, as he'd be able to push democrats and resulting changes further left.
opinions of the new regulation mostly break down along predictable philosophical and party lines: more liberal or democratic-affiliated commissioners tend to be critical of the new regulation, while more conservative and republican-affiliated ones tend to support it.
that's why mueller's testimony could be a do-over. it's an opportunity for fence-sitting democrats to acknowledge what trump has done, and it's an opportunity for democrats to finally correct the narrative that trump was somehow cleared of wrongdoing.
in an interview before his primary victory, he seemed confident his momentum would continue into november. he contrasted his success building up meyer distributing, his warehouse distribution business, with what he said was donnelly's failed legal career and ineffective time in politics.
this is why barack obama touched many in 2008. this is why both bernie sanders and trump touched many in 2016. yes, i am putting their three names together because whether we like it or not, what they have in common, is that they said what people felt, they said what people needed to hear. this is why, even with their many shortcomings, it suggests a different path for american leaders.
last spring, at the end of the 2018 kentucky general assembly session, gop lawmakers tried to force through a series of changes to the state's pension program by attaching them to a bill that otherwise dealt with sewage-related issues. that led to what was effectively a strike by public educators, who called in sick and shut down schools across the state before they flocked to frankfort, the state capital, for mass protests. pensions weren't the only issue: teachers at the protest saw bevin, who has also signed legislation legalizing charter schools and approved budgets that have cut funding for k-12 education, as an antagonist to the very idea of public schooling, and they were joined by organized state employees who saw it all as the next step in a concerted attack on working folks.
though all three top-tier candidates received plenty of attention from the moderators ― biden led in speaking time, with 17½ minutes, warren was second with 16½ minutes, and sanders was in fourth beyond booker with 14 minutes ― all also had stretches when they seemed to take a back seat. their campaigns are likely to be fine with that. at this point, the front-runners have much more ground to lose than they stand to gain.
trump has become so pro-guns that he has even blamed the paris terror attacks on too strict of gun control had there been some guys with a gun, there would have been a shootout and probably the primary people that would have got whacked would have been the killers, trump said on cnbc's squawk box.
in 2012, a divided u.s. supreme court upheld most of its provisions, including the individual mandate, which requires people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty.
still, biden had been wary of overreach on health care before he became vice president, just as he's declined to endorse the most ambitious health reforms some democrats are proposing today. taken together, this history and rhetoric could be clues to how biden would actually act as president, and not just on health care.
the case, texas v. u.s., comes from 20 republican state officials and has the support of president donald trump. it claims that a newly introduced, fatal constitutional flaw in the law known as obamacare requires that the federal courts end the entire program.
neither of my opponents has any resources, mcsally told her volunteers in a speech peppered with military metaphors. so we're taking the fight to the democrats.
america's unusual health care system that links coverage to jobs means that during bad economic times, people who find themselves jobless are also suddenly without protection from medical costs.
their money problems began when the university of virginia health system pursued the couple with a lawsuit and a lien on their home to recoup $164,000 in charges for waldron's emergency surgery in 2017.
fortunately, a few cooler heads offered tempered responses. writing in the new republic, matt ford provided the clearest articulation of what seemed to be the consensus critique of romney's essay: that romney's objection to trump's style rather than his substance represents nothing different from the feckless protestations once offered by former senators jeff flake (r-ariz.) and bob corker (r-tenn.).
drafting the tax reform bill was messy. bills were introduced and rejected, deals were cut, and leaders tried again and again to find something that would pass. finally, on dec. 3, 1985, 11 months into the 99th congress, h.r. 3838 was introduced in the house. after several setbacks, it passed the house on dec. 17 on a voice vote. off it went to the senate, which scheduled 12 more hearings to work up its own bill.
trump went far beyond anyone else, calling obama and his policies stupid and claiming that obama was incompetent.
in a question about medicaid's funding structure, aarp notes that the capped medicaid payments in the republican bill would rise with inflation but may not cover rising costs of health care needs. sixty-eight percent of the surveyed voters, including 59 percent of trump voters, support preserving medicaid in its current form.
democrats in florida and georgia are running on medicaid expansion, which will not be easy to pull off quickly if, as seems likely, republicans are still in charge of their state legislatures. but voter initiatives to expand medicaid are on the ballot in three other, deeply conservative states: idaho, nebraska and utah. put it all together and it's no exaggeration to say that november's elections could mean gaining or losing health care access for hundreds of thousands of americans ― and maybe even millions.
in the words of roe, however: we did cover pre-existing conditions, in a different way.
the filing is not a surprise. when the 5th circuit issued its ruling last month, california attorney general xavier becerra, who has led the democratic coalition fighting the lawsuit, said the states were likely to seek an immediate supreme court hearing. several experts that huffpost contacted friday agreed that the democratic coalition has a strong case on the merits.
but most states depend on the insurance marketplace run by the federal government. open enrollment for states that use the federal exchange ended on dec. 15. but a spokeswoman for the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms), which runs the trump administration insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, said officials are now considering a new enrollment period.
a former adviser to three republican presidents called the speech donald trump gave before a crowd of supporters saturday in pennsylvania the most divisive he has ever heard from a president.
trump can thank his inability or unwillingness to challenge traditional republican ideology for his consistent polling deficit against democratic nominee joe biden during this year's election cycle, according to saagar enjeti, co-author of the populist's guide to 2020: a new right and new left are rising.
california's policy would be a big step up from what the state currently offers: six weeks of caregiving leave, plus six to eight weeks for birth mothers through the state's disability fund. the policy covers new parents and those who need time off to care for a sick loved one, offering a percentage of pay up to $1,216 a week.
trump had tried the same strategy wednesday in iowa, bringing wrestling legend dan gable onstage.
(to be clear, i'm not suggesting we let corporations dictate which basic services get offered or how core taxes are spent — only that we could allow them to funnel marginal amounts into special investment buckets as one example of reframing the problem in non-divisive way.)
trump and republican leaders in congress faced headwinds even before the cbo analysis came out. conservative republicans in congress protest that the legislation provides too much federal assistance for low- and middle-income households. centrist republicans ― especially senators whose states adopted the law's medicaid expansion for poor adults ― have expressed concern about cutting off people from their coverage.
fox news did not respond to queries for this story. it has previously told huffpost that it does not suppress criticism of trump.
it's a huge step forward, smith told huffpost. even though rates are going up in 2017 i'm still paying far less than i was before for the same comprehensive coverage.
leahy surfaced emails involving kavanaugh and miranda, asking why kavanaugh did not question how miranda was able to send him very private emails from democrats. the senator suggested the emails may contradict a prior statement from kavanaugh in which he denied any prior knowledge of the hack, and argued that more documents from kavanaugh's time in the bush white house should be released to the committee.
as rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) put it, democrats are still years away from reaching a critical mass on medicare for all. and he noted that there would be tremendous resistance to enacting much of what sanders and other progressives in congress want.
house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) can't make much sense of it.
learn here how obamacare works and whether you are eligible for a subsidy to lower your costs. you to make choices not only on cost, but on physicians, hospitals and drug coverage included in each. (note: even though the open enrollment period is over, if you suddenly need coverage as the result of a qualifying event, you can sign up now.)
i think it's on the back burner, jarvis said. he added that residents in his district have all but given up hope of an adequate response from trump. i think the best word is despondent, he said. the idea of hope right now in our region of the state is not something that people talk about much. everybody knows somebody that has a substance abuse problem. you are past the point of anger. we feel broken. we feel abandoned.
@ira i had to join in.... obamacare vs. gop replacement pic.twitter.com/q3shu78d2c — lisa s. (@ala005) march 7, 2017
the supreme court's decision on these petitions may come down to strategy and guesswork on the part of those four democratic appointees. although they presumably find the argument in texas v. u.s. as absurd as the rest of the legal establishment does, they would have to weigh the potential upsides and downsides of taking the case now.
how experts and groups are reacting
there is not yet a path for everybody who was uninsured or becomes uninsured to get new coverage, she continued. and for some people, there's a path, but it's really windy and if you get lost on the way, you're going to wind up not getting coverage.
the politics here are pretty straightforward: democrats control the house and will definitely not help trump dismantle the affordable care act and replace it with something worse, and senate republicans have no interest in falling on their faces again for no reason.
giving capitol tours to important donors and constituents
that looked to be a clear signal of failure, but there are, at least, some indications that freedom caucus conservatives could be split.
but not all berners will, which enrages and confounds hillary supporters. however, i think this again stems from hillary fans not fully understanding who bernie fans are.
so the question becomes, will we continue down that path of getting more details quickly after a vote on friday? meadows said.
i think there's probably a bunch of republicans in a position where they're damned no matter what they do politically, sen. chris murphy (d-conn.) said this week. if you vote against the president, then his base is going to come calling. if you vote to defend what he did, then you don't look terribly independent-minded. i think that's a problem for a lot of republicans.
following a brief hold at the top of the republican pack, the soft-spoken detroit native saw his poll numbers drop following reports of factually inaccurate anecdotes he told on the campaign trail.
these are the kinds of faulty projections that could come out of any entity attempting to forecast the effects of a major law. because the congressional budget office doesn't serve a particular agenda ― as the office of management and budget and industry groups do ― it regularly revises scores to reflect new information.
in calling the bluff of on-the-fence lawmakers, trump runs a massive risk of violating a primary campaign pledge to repeal obamacare and suffering a major legislative defeat in his first effort to pass major legislation. while many republicans have been arguing that failure to repeal obamacare would sink the president's entire agenda ― and likely hand congress to the democrats in 2018 ― mulvaney signaled that the administration didn't intend to give up on other plans, and would move onto an ambitious tax reform effort if the repeal bid failed.
trump says cruz is unhinged...unstable... can't withstand the pressure and lies so much he is disgusting...i've never met a politician who lies more than ted cruz....he is the most dishonest politician i have ever met...a bad guy...a nasty guy. trump says cruz in iowa mailed a fraudulent document, then lied by spreading election day rumors about ben carson dropping out, possibly cheating carson out of second place, and thus depriving trump of first place, and that cruz then lied to ben carson. as i predicted in an analysis of evangelicals, trump would reprise these issues to try to impeach cruz.

and while the house has taken steps to move some official actions online ― members can now submit legislation, new cosponsors and remarks electronically ― committees have struggled to hold hearings, and there has been no replacement for the important role of kibitizing in congress.
that's how it should be. but if anybody needs another motivation, there is also plenty to fear — not just more of the same, but much more and much worse. now is the chance to take a stand.
carlos barria/reuters sen. sullivan, foreground, speaks at a ceremony celebrating donald trump's tax cuts. his fortunes could depend on whether alaskans distinguish him from the president.
whether those officials can continue to defend the law in court is the issue that prompted the late july request for more briefs, rattling defenders of the law who think the standing issue is as straightforward as the case itself. (to establish standing, a party has to show it would suffer harm from a ruling, and there's no question that all states would suffer harm, starting with the massive reduction in federal spending on health insurance for their residents.)
those are some of the key findings in a new poll from the nonpartisan henry j. kaiser family foundation. the results say a lot about why so many democrats are talking about ideas like medicare for all these days ― and why, to succeed, those democrats still have a lot of work to do.
there was also talk of how the savings realized from removing those 24 million people from the insurance rolls would accrue to the wealthy, in the form of tax cuts .
today's tax bill fares at least as badly when compared to the affordable care act on other measures. just 27 percent of americans in cnn's most recent survey think that president donald trump and congressional republicans made a good faith effort to cooperate with democrats on the tax bill. in 2010, 48 percent thought that president obama and the democrats had reached across the aisle on health care reform.

point number one: when you hear someone longing for the good old days, take it with a grain of salt. (laughter and applause.) take it with a grain of salt. we live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history. we are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before. but i guess it's part of human nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked, and the economy hummed, and all politicians were wise, and every kid was well-mannered, and america pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world. guess what. it ain't so. (laughter.) the good old days weren't that great.
the republican in the race, a retired cop, john marino, is running as a trump-esque candidate. we deserve to be 'first' again, he says.
whatever the precise details of the policy change, the timing is critical. the open enrollment period for 2017 ends next week, on jan. 31, and traditionally, signups have surged in the final days before the deadline.

the next sign-up period for the health insurance exchanges begins nov. 1. the administration could choose to pick up where obama's team left off and engage in a nationwide campaign to publicize health insurance enrollment and help people apply for coverage.
the other major component of the republican bill that older workers disliked is a feature that would allow insurance companies to charge older workers five times more than their younger peers.
if you are like me and experienced the 1986 act, you really realize nobody can get tax legislation close to right anyway, trier said. but this [2017 tax bill] is worse — there is no question about it in my view — than the 1986 act.
so when the speaker says give me a break ... no let's give the babies a break. let's pass this bill, pelosi said at an event with other democratic leaders, two doctors and a mother holding her baby.

editor's note: donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the u.s.
in june, trump pledged to issue a short list of prospective supreme court nominees ahead of the november election. it's a repeat of a 2016 campaign tactic that helped win over many republican voters, according to exit polls.
an analysis published tuesday, before the draft was released, by the center for american progress said prices could go up for mental health and substance use disorder treatment because of these waivers.
going into the debate, conservative news outlets reported on emails allegedly belonging to biden's son hunter that show the young man discussing business proposals for shady companies in ukraine and china. joe biden's critics have seized on some of the language in those communications to argue that hunter cut his father in on the money he was making from his work for companies that had a stake in obama administration policies while biden was serving as vice president.
the atlanta journal-constitution reported in april that perdue made at least 112 transactions in march, including purchases of stocks in a company that makes medical gear. he denied wrongdoing.
since then, trump has repeatedly promised he'd come up with an alternative like the one he described in his presidential campaign and again on thursday ― one that would provide better coverage than the affordable care act has made available, at a lower price. but he never has.
during dozens of interviews with stakeholders in the prep field, including clinicians, social service workers, nonprofit leaders and researchers, many expressed concern that an unexpected downside of prep's recent burst onto the scene is that the hiv prevention method is apparently on a path to widen already tragic racial disparities in infection rates among msm.
the question now is whether barrett brings similar feelings to the case ― and whether she's the kind of judge who thinks the quality of legal arguments matters.
sentiments like that could be a real problem for gross in alaska, where sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) won the 2016 democratic presidential caucus with nearly 82% of the vote. (biden bested sanders by 11 percentage points this year in an april primary held after sanders had formally withdrawn from the race.)
many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america's interests first.
a ruling against the aca would have far-reaching consequences, including an estimated 20 million people losing their health coverage, the elimination of medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies, and the abolishment of the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions.
even without a to-do list from local party leaders, trump is managing to be liberals' greatest organizer, with one extraordinary move after another drawing public outrage. with his muslim ban on hold, his popularity plummeting, national security adviser mike flynn fired, obamacare repeal looking less and less likely and labor department nominee andy puzder defeated, democrats can start to point to wins that keep newly engaged activists fighting.
while no one believes the republican authors of the tax bill intentionally planned to give smaller tax cuts to minorities, the law, nevertheless, does just that. in so doing, the law perpetuates a deep racial economic inequality in which whites' median household income is nearly two-thirds more than blacks'.
in the past month, k.c. handler has suffered a knee injury and two cracked teeth — but that's nothing compared to the hassle she's experienced with her insurance company and with obamacare, she said.
in 1999 donald trump renounces the republican party saying, i really believe that republicans are just too crazy right. he said when he declared he would register with the independence party, the new york version of the reform party, according to a new york times article written in 1999.
correction: an earlier version of this article said that texas v. u.s. prevailed in a u.s. district court in 2017. it was 2018.
a: their plan, insofar as they have one, remains to repeal obamacare. and though they don't have the votes to make that happen right now, the trump administration is supporting a lawsuit that would wipe away the affordable care act and leave 20 million more americans uninsured. the administration is also doing what it can to undermine the law via executive action.

one form that could take, levitt explained, is helping states set up reinsurance funds like the one in alaska. these compensate insurers that experience higher-than-expected costs, which allows them to charge lower premiums. and lower premiums mean less federal spending on tax credits, so these programs can actually save the federal government money, levitt said.

the number of people without insurance would have ultimately increased by 23 million, the congressional budget office predicted. (the number may have been too high, but there's no question the bill would have led to significant coverage losses.)
that's a massive ideological gap to close, dwarfing anything democrats had within their ranks in 2009 and 2010. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has indicated he wants to bring legislation from the house directly to the floor, and amend it there, next week. it looks an awful lot like an attempt to rush the process even more than the house did, perhaps in the hopes that mcconnell can force his caucus into voting yes before anybody quite grasps the full implications of the proposed law.
mekelburg named her organization resistance against islamic radicals (rair). she created a website, set up a facebook page and a twitter handle, and recruited cortez to design artwork from behind bars, according to galasso. rair's mission would be to stop the jihadi infiltration in our american communities. mekelburg didn't mention herself anywhere on the organization's website. under an accomplices section, however, she posted the names, photos and contact information for people and groups she believed were collaborating with jihadi terrorists. that could mean anyone with a connection to islam.
in 2016, they got their wish. but they still couldn't get the job done. the senate never passed the house repeal legislation. public opinion swung in favor of the law, and many of the house members who took the tough vote to advance repeal now find themselves on the defensive at home.
that decision hit some insurers hard, and in some cases was a key factor in their eventual decisions to shut down.
very smart tweet, thank you. — kevin m. kruse (@kevinmkruse) february 15, 2019
insurers will be allowed to include fewer essential community providers in their networks. narrow network plans are a key way for insurers to keep costs down by excluding the most expensive providers. obama required them to include at least 30 percent of area health providers that care for medically underserved and poor patients. trump will reduce that threshold to 20 percent and leave it to states or private accrediting entities to determine whether an insurance policy has enough providers in its network.
we already know the farm bureau plans won't be limited to people who work in agriculture or farming, and in iowa, the farm bureau recently expanded marketing of its unregulated plans to people who are offered employer coverage, lueck said.
quite possibly, republicans figure they have nothing to lose because their supporters get information from outlets like fox news, which rarely scrutinizes gop officials the way the rest of the mainstream media does. and they might be right.
she needs to be herself, dinkin said. that means she needs to explain to people in the way that only she can how our economy and our democracy have been twisted and distorted, who is responsible and how we're going to come together to fix it. that's the campaign that is inspiring people and expanding the progressive movement.
california's new budget agreement addresses this affordability problem primarily in two ways. first, it offers additional state assistance to some of the people who are already eligible for federal subsidies. second, the agreement pushes the income threshold for assistance all the way up to six times the poverty line. that works out to about $75,000 for an individual and $155,000 for a family of four.
lots of people remember how then-sen. joe lieberman, the independent from connecticut who caucused with democrats, killed the public option ― a hoped-for government-run insurance plan that was going to offer an alternative to private coverage and might have someday grown into a version of medicare for all in which the federal government insured everybody directly.
but overall, multiple studies have shown that the law has improved access to care. most likely, that is because obamacare comprises all of those disparate pieces: the multiple regulations on insurance, the generous subsidies and the medicaid expansion funding.
hearings play a vital role in the passage of laws, experts say. if done well, they elicit reactions to legislative proposals from the people who would be affected — but also from people who have no skin in the game. if you don't have hearings, if you don't bring the experts in, if you don't hear many sides to the issues, if you don't allow for that input, then you don't really have legislation, rep. bill pascrell (d-n.j.), a senior member of the house ways and means committee, told the hill last week.
that means older and lower-income individuals could pay more for their premiums and out-of-pocket costs. others may simply drop their insurance ― since there will be no mandate to have coverage under the republican legislation ― and would have no protection from sky-high medical bills at all.
in fact, congress has already recognized these realities. the first coronavirus emergency bill that trump signed includes additional medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. that law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. extra medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.

i don't think anybody changed anybody's mind on anything at this point, but at least he knows the door is open for discussion, sen. mike rounds (r-s.d.), another senator who spoke with biden, said wednesday.
this job is on a two-year contract basis.
trump's blame of obama comes even as trump ignored warnings from his own department of health and human services last october that a pandemic would overwhelm the country's ability to deal with it, as well as a similar briefing prepared by the outgoing obama administration in january 2017. more recently, trump ignored intelligence community reports this january and february that the virus was spreading far more rapidly in china than its government was letting on, the washington post reported.
house lawmakers are hoping to end debate and vote on the bill by wednesday so that their senate colleagues have sufficient time to do the same before the friday deadline.
we're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved ― almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter ― a plan, he said. it'll be repeal and replace. it will be essentially simultaneously. it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day ― could be the same hour.
maxson, another sanders supporter, momentarily considered supporting green party candidate david kulma, in light of kulma's support for single-payer health insurance and other positions that she said reminded her of what sanders stood for. (a fourth candidate, josh thornton of the american party, supports single-payer too.)
at one point in the kaiser forum, a panelist asked biden why he thought republicans would negotiate on any legislation, given their hostility to democrats and opposition to a children's health proposal then before congress. biden predicted that with george w. bush gone, he would be able to bring around some republicans. i'd be president and bush wouldn't be, he quipped.

uva offers uninsured patients 20% off to start and an additional 15% to 20% if they pay promptly, swensen said. few are able to do that. patients are subject to collections and lawsuits if they do not pay or arrange to do so within four months, he said.
in a special election to fill the congressional seat in kansas' deep-red 4th district last tuesday, the democratic candidate james thompson lost by just 7 percentage points, after republican mike pompeo, who is now cia director, won by more than 30 points in 2016. thompson benefited from a last-minute infusion of $200,000 raised by readers of the liberal site daily kos and other activists, but got only a modicum of assistance from the dccc.
in virginia, unfortunately, we have not expanded medicaid. a repeal of the aca, accompanied by a proposed block grant, could cost the state of virginia in the next budget over $300 million, said virginia gov. terry mcauliffe (d), the chair of the nga, who spoke alongside sandoval at the event.
8. kellyanne conway, counselor to the president. last week's ranking: ―
president donald trump tried to attack democratic rival joe biden over and over again for controversial policy positions that biden does not hold during the second and final presidential debate on thursday night. he claimed, inaccurately, that biden wants to impose a national lockdown to control covid-19, ban fracking and eliminate private health insurance.
a final decision to end obamacare would also have significant political ramifications, although it is unclear, given that the case has been sent back to a lower court, whether a ruling from the supreme court would come before or after the 2020 election.
they were perfectly lawful and the supreme court had never said otherwise until she got involved, said ria tabacco mar, the current director of the women's rights project. she went after those laws and attacked them.
as jeans explained that night, he had been a lifelong conservative and one of obamacare's biggest critics until he got cancer, giving him a preexisting condition that required expensive treatment ― and insurance. thanks to the affordable care act, i'm standing here today alive, he told ryan.
in addition to worrying about their long-term future in a world where insurance companies can go back to discriminating against people because of their medical histories, gordon has to worry about the day-to-day costs of staying healthy.
igor bobic / huffpost at wednesday's town hall, rep. tom macarthur insisted that no one with pre-existing conditions will be declined coverage or not be able to afford coverage under the gop bill.
people who need to obtain coverage after the open enrollment period will have to prove it. certain life changes ― such as getting married, having a child or moving ― give consumers the opportunity to buy plans at any point during the year. under obama, these people merely had to attest to their new circumstances; trump will require documentation. insurers complained that people used these special enrollment periods to get coverage only when they needed medical care.
the state added around 30,000 cases in the last week alone, for a total of more than 130,000 cases since early march.
but sitting in front of a monstrously large, wall-mounted alaska king salmon that she caught herself ― his name is walter and he weighed 63 pounds when he was alive, rest his soul ― murkowski seemed incredibly at ease with her reputation for acting more independently than her gop colleagues. it makes her a rare breed in a congress that's become so politically polarized that it struggles just to keep the government open.

this story has been updated with comments from amy mcgrath and charles booker.
and since the measure also contains substantial tax cuts for wealthy people and health care companies, it may wind up increasing the budget deficit. if the congressional budget office comes to that conclusion, that will likely exacerbate the revolt among the most conservative congressional republicans against the bill.

peters has had an overwhelming advantage with black voters in michigan so far. in mid-october, he was leading james 61% to 8% among african americans, who make up nearly 40% of the electorate in michigan's most populous county.
sanders and warren want to create a single, government-run, medicare for all plan that would enroll every american, displacing all existing arrangements and dictating prices to every provider and supplier of health care in the country. everybody would have insurance, nobody would owe out-of-pocket costs, and health care spending would probably come down over time.
republicans downplayed any national implications of the loss. the party held on to two state legislative districts that were up for grabs, and actually won control of two statewide offices democrats had long held. daniel cameron, a former aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, won the state attorney general race — an office democrats had held for more than 70 years. and republicans took over the secretary of state office. those victories, they argue, show bevin's loss was about him more than any broader problems for trump or the gop as a whole.
while losing employer-based health benefits enables people to enroll on the exchanges, that's not the case for people who didn't have employer-based health benefits to begin with.
even if the court were to decide the mandate is now unconstitutional, that doesn't mean the rest of the law has to go. under well-established, widely recognized principles of severability, judges are supposed to do minimal damage to a law when they declare a piece of it unconstitutional.
democrat sima ladjevardian, a lawyer and former beto o'rourke adviser, says texas' second district, surrounding houston, has completely changed since crenshaw, the former united states navy seal, was first elected to congress two years ago. in 2016, trump won 52% of the vote in this district. then o'rourke lost the area by just a percentage point in his 2018 senate race.
rather than back the elimination of the 60-vote threshold on legislation known as the filibuster, a move that some other democratic presidential candidates have called for, sanders said he would dispense with the arcane budgetary rules known as reconciliation, so democrats could pass a bill creating a medicare for all health care system with a simple majority of 51 votes.
both speeches had their merits — beshear's, in particular, previewed the party's relentless focus on health care during the midterm elections — but are mostly now remembered for the awkwardly lit diner where beshear delivered his speech and for how wet kennedy's lips appeared.
mekelburg told her new neighbors that she was a psychotherapist in the prison system, working to help inmates transition back to civilian life and overturn wrongful convictions. she said she had a private practice in manhattan but had moved to fishkill because her clients had been transferred to prisons throughout the hudson valley. she said green haven correctional facility paid her rent, but in reality, siino took care of that.
change is what barzee flores has been promising to deliver on a variety of issues on which diaz-balart has voted uniformly with the gop and president donald trump. a former judge who was nominated to the federal bench by president barack obama ― then blocked by sen. marco rubio, under pressure by gop leaders, after he recommended her for the job ― barzee flores hopes a blue wave carries her to washington.
we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, trump said last week. this from the man who has spent his presidency undermining the aca and its provisions for people with preexisting conditions.
the current state of play for health care is a reminder of one way that the gop's war on obamacare has made headway ― by giving states more control so that access to health care in places like georgia looks more and more different than it does in california.
it is an almost perfect inversion of obamacare, not that anybody should be surprised. republicans spent seven years attacking the health care law and pretending they had a better way to protect the poor and the sick, even as they called for policy changes that would expose both groups to crippling medical costs. writing legislation has revealed that contradiction once and for all. republicans still have the votes to pass repeal. but if they do, they will be delivering something very different than they promised.
carson gained favor among conservatives for his blunt disposition and attacks on political correctness. his speech at the 2013 national prayer breakfast, followed by a wall street journal op-ed calling for ben carson for president, ignited his presidential aspirations. he made headlines for several outlandish statements throughout his campaign, having once called obamacare the worst thing since slavery and blaming the holocaust on gun control.

mueller's russia probe seems expansive and shows no sign of winding down. a house controlled by democrats wouldn't just be a threat to trump's agenda and the gop's willful subservience to him; it would mean the opening of deep investigations into corruption in the white house and even of republicans on capitol hill, like house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes (r-calif.), who've acted with brazen disregard for justice on behalf of trump.
as the leader of one of the nation's leading latino organizations, i know that the candidates for the presidency understand that their success in november will depend, in large measure, on whether latino voters head to the polls or stay at home. last year, as the primary season was getting underway, i looked at some of the key issues that matter to latino voters and how candidates needed to address them in order to get latino voters on their side. with approximately 100 days left before election day, it's important to revisit some of these issues and remind ourselves--and the candidates--what really matters this campaign season to latino voters.
the affordable care act, or obamacare, reduced the number of americans without insurance to a record low. but millions still don't have coverage and a big reason is that enrollment remains optional, especially now that republicans have eliminated the financial penalty for people who decline insurance.

that's why this system is rigged, booker responded.
washington is full of advisory boards that make recommendations congress largely ignores. but ipab has special authority. its proposals take effect automatically unless congress passes alternative cuts that yield similar savings ― or unless a supermajority in the senate votes to let medicare spending rise faster than the targets.
which is not to say repeal will happen. the new lawsuit would have to prevail at the supreme court, which has twice declined opportunities to throw out the affordable care act, and a new law would require both trump's reelection and a republican rout in the house, which would be hard for the gop to pull off if current polling is correct.
obama did what he could with what he had to use, but the truth is that this is not about the president of the united states at the end of the day. it is about power and privilege, who has it and who does not. there is nothing inherently wrong with being wealthy. that is not my issue and, heck, i would love to be wealthy myself, as long as my wealth white by stepping on or over my fellow human beings.
these fights are likely to get more intense, not less, in the coming weeks and months. but they will take place against the backdrop of a biden presidency, which is an opportunity democrats will happily take.
this has been an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits, biden, still the clear front-runner, told the crowd.

representation does matter, of course, but it's not the only thing that matters. representation without ideology is empty, said friedman. it signifies an attitude towards women in which we are all interchangeable. that our gender is the only thing that matters about us. and that we're completely interchangeable. which is what patriarchs in the conservative movement believe.

and in recent campaign rallies, trump had started calling obama barack hussein obama again — a huge applause line for his audiences and a touchstone back to the idea that obama was somehow not really american.
in 2014, she also started using neo-nazi terms like cultural marxism and borrowing propaganda from white supremacists like kenn gividen, who runs a racist website and at one point was the presidential candidate for the white nationalist american freedom party. she encouraged her readers to follow jared wyand, a white supremacist and anti-semite who openly praises adolf hitler and denies the holocaust happened.
the trump hotel's insurance is pretty good, according to paul fronstin, director of the health research and education program at the employee benefit research institute. he reviewed a copy of the trump international hotel las vegas health benefits guide that the union provided to salon. the premiums are below average, says fronstin. some might consider this a cadillac plan.
her message went furthest in the state's suburbs: according to the atlanta journal-constitution, she won cobb county, a populous suburb of atlanta where former house speaker newt gingrich began his political career, with 54 percent of the vote, four years after gop then-gov. nathan deal won it with 56 percent. in gwinnett county, she garnered 57 percent of the vote, a massive spike from the 42 percent democratic nominee jason carter got in the 2014 governor's contest.
grayson is also in a major spat with senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.), who said to grayson in may: i want you to lose. a recent politico story detailing past domestic abuse allegations against grayson caused him to lose the endorsements of progressive groups. then there's the prolonged anullment fight with the mother of his five children.
there is little dispute about the potential consequences of a ruling against the health care law known as obamacare. the law has touched nearly every facet of the health care system, in ways that have proved both popular and unpopular. the law now prohibits insurers from screening for pre-existing conditions, for example, while those requirements have also raised premiums for some people who buy insurance on their own.
it's one more restriction on the entry of immigrants to america whose numbers have already been significantly curtailed by the trump administration. the requirement will also block immigrants who cannot prove they can afford pricey u.s. health insurance policies that are increasingly out of reach of americans.

republican u.s. rep. roger marshall held off state sen. barbara bollier to win an open u.s. senate seat in kansas, the associated press projected tuesday night, spoiling democratic hopes of an upset in the deep-red state where they haven't won a senate contest since 1932.
in a single-payer system like the nyha or medicare for all, the government sets prices for the suppliers and providers of medical care, including not just drug companies but also doctors and hospitals. that's why these sorts of proposals can show such big savings.
another path forward is to work on the insurance side to make sure more people have the kind of coverage that lets them get drugs for diabetes, or any other serious condition, without worrying about such big out-of-pocket costs.
so much so, that it's actually becoming a symbol of of the #nevertrump movement. on thursday, several silent protesters were ejected from a trump rally in maine for holding up their pocket constitutions. watch the video below.

however, the study also said the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess the gnd (green new deal) using the standard tools of policy analysis, since many of the policies proposed in the gnd are redundant with other aspects in it, that complicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict.
as congressional republicans move forward on plans to quickly repeal and ― less quickly ― replace president barack obama's health care law, a wide variety of industry and political influencers are trying to slow their progress. among the most persuasive may be a set of republican governors who are fearful about losing the substantial health and monetary benefits from the law that their states currently enjoy.
during the campaign, he promised a great, great wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. in recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the bollard fencing developed during president barack obama's administration.

we must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge, trump said. my administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. the struggle will be long and it will be difficult ― but, as americans always do, in the end, we will succeed, we will prevail.
in 1998, i graduated college, qualified for the new york city marathon and was starting an m.d.-ph.d program at the university of pennsylvania. i should have been at the top of my game, but i felt terrible. i had abdominal pain that woke me up at night and was going to the bathroom nearly every hour, sometimes urinating what looked like pure blood. i had never been sick in this way before and i was too afraid to tell anyone how i felt.
the core question in texas v. u.s. is about the affordable care act's individual mandate. the mandate, which as written originally imposed a fine on people without health insurance, was also the subject of the first major supreme court ruling on the health care law.
the ratings agency standard & poor's projects 6 million to 10 million people would lose their coverage under this legislation, and the center for a responsible federal budget says the tax cuts are worth $600 billion.
medicare for none has become a favored talking point in recent months for republicans like trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.).
that kind of evidence ought to clinch the case for the defense, if it were ever in doubt, although it's impossible to know how judge o'connor will see things. wednesday's hearing is for a preliminary injunction, with the plaintiffs asking him to block the federal government from enforcing the law until the lawsuit gets a full hearing. o'connor could grant that injunction, applying it to the entire country or just the 20 states where officials signed on to the case. or he could issue a full judgment on the merits of the lawsuit.

sen. gary peters (d-mich.) can't fully explain why there are so many undecided voters left in his state two weeks ahead of one of the highest stakes elections in a generation.
y'all are going to win this, the incoming message, from a republican friend brewer had come to know well, told her. too nervous to leave her home, brewer frantically searched the internet for confirmation that gov. matt bevin, kentucky's unpopular leader, had really lost.
but if the regulation eventually takes effect, republicans will be closer to their goal of creating an insurance system with fewer rules on what or whom plans must cover. and the health care landscape would look very different as a result.
but, the judge said, internal company documents suggested the company remained optimistic about the long-term prospects for the exchanges and was seriously considering expansion, even after learning about its 2016 losses.
fact-checking site snopes.com pointed out last year that the trump administration slashed the obamacare open enrollment period by more than half, from three months to six weeks, so the downtime consumes more of the enrollment period.
previous house judiciary committee hearings on the mueller report, featuring area experts but no fact witnesses, have been sparsely attended. wednesday's hearing will be packed, and the testimony will certainly provide plenty of fodder for cable news.
the filings were part of a lawsuit, now called texas v. u.s., that started with 20 republican state officials and claims that a fatal constitutional flaw in obamacare requires invalidating the entire program. president donald trump instructed the justice department to support the lawsuit, and if it succeeds, 20 million people could lose their health coverage.
what two-word slogan and ideological term was used as the title of a 1954 book by richard wright and was later popularized by stokely carmichael during his time as chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee (sncc) before evolving into a broader (and potent) political movement? (black power)
but he got to know donnelly during the factory fights and said the senator even wrote him a job recommendation. feltner didn't get that job, but donnelly will probably get his vote.
while i planned on serving out the remainder of my term in congress, i know in my heart it's time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve, he said in the statement.
at the same time, tipirneni is keenly aware that she needs the support of independents and republicans to win. to this end, she has not made trump a focus of her run ― or really spoken much about him at all.
a postal service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on individual personnel matters, but we take seriously our obligation to follow department of labor guidance on the nursing mothers law.
lawmakers should shore up the existing weak spots in the federal nursing mothers law, said galen sherwin, a lawyer specializing in women's rights at the american civil liberties union. in addition to expanding the law's coverage, sherwin said congress should raise awareness of the law by requiring employers to hang notices in the workplace, much like posters explaining the minimum wage. many women probably don't file complaints because they don't know they can.
my quick take is that they are creating new sets of winners and losers here, sabrina corlette, a senior research fellow at georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms, told huffpost on thursday. in the individual market, winners will be younger people who are ok with skimpier benefits, losers are older folks like early retirees.
even a poll commissioned by america first policies, a pro-trump group, found that lowering the cost of health care is the top issue for many voters. of the respondents who said health care is a top concern, only 34 percent said they want obamacare repealed and replaced. forty-seven percent wanted problems with the law to be fixed, while 15 percent said they want it to stay exactly as it is.
the combined effort makes it appear as if vulnerable republicans senators are trying to convince voters barrett won't push for unpopular conservative policy goals, including the repeal of abortion rights and the elimination of medicaid expansion, if she gains a seat on the nation's highest court.

he also has been open to discussing with them other ideas they may have regarding changes to the aca, snyder spokesman ari adler said. too often, it seems that the aca gets reported on as an all-or-nothing package, but there are many separate components that exist. in michigan's case, we took the idea of medicaid expansion, made it our own, improved it and made it work better. but, as you know, everything is up for discussion and the governor is happy to have those discussions.
the entirety of his presidency, he's been dividing our country, letting down workers, rewarding the rich, and caving to china. he pledged to fix our problems, but instead he took us backward, dnc chair tom perez said in a statement about the ad.
a budget deal or debt ceiling increase with democrats would be an obvious choice, but there's little impetus to pass one of those bills at this point, and republicans would functionally be giving up on their repeal efforts and removing the one negotiating chip they may have to force democrats to the table on a bipartisan health care bill.
although the two groups have different ideas of what a replacement should look like, both of them want more information from gop leadership on the obamacare alternative.
washington ― the senate voted on wednesday to confirm chad readler to the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit, despite strong opposition from democrats over his leading role in the trump administration's efforts to dismantle the affordable care act's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.
sanders' plan hinges on overruling the senate parliamentarian, the person in charge of figuring out whether a piece of legislation meets the conditions attached to reconciliation. given the degree of its impact on issues like health care and taxing and spending, medicare for all would likely face a very difficult time meeting those rules. therefore, sanders says he would instruct his future vice president ― who also serves as the president of the senate ― to overrule the chamber's parliamentarian and allow the bill to pass with a simple majority.
spending time away from your family
isn't there at least a policy lesson there that the old romneycare/obamacare, private insurance marketplace that is now being so viciously torn apart by republican majorities is less politically sustainable than kind of a straight, liberal reform that people understand, that's simple, that hasn't been unaffordable for people?
mcclellan has been a leader on racial justice issues in virginia, as vice chair of the virginia legislative black caucus and chair of the virginia dr. martin luther king jr. memorial commission.
the cdc, for one, is stepping up to the plate. prep promotion among black msm is a central focus of two major multiyear awards exceeding $300 million that the cdc has granted to health departments and social service groups in high-impact cities nationwide.
listen, i don't have reason to think we won't be together awhile, or i wouldn't be bringing you here at all, i told him. but this is my yoga studio. no matter what happens with us, i claim this place.
the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently projected that if current trends persist, half of all black msm will contract hiv in their lifetime, compared with 1 in 11 (or 9 percent) of their white counterparts. and in a cdc study of msm in 20 major u.s. cities, 30 percent of blacks were living with hiv, compared with 14 percent of whites.
former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams' speech this year may also end up being remembered for something other than its content, if it's remembered at all. (it has been years since the state of the union — or the opposition party's response — had an actual, measurable impact on american politics.) but democratic leaders' decision to have abrams deliver the response shows the party isn't quite as lost as it was in the months following trump's surprising victory over hillary clinton. the party, or at least its top operatives, now knows in what direction it wants to head, and it's toward more candidates like abrams.
what obama has provided in these remarks and over the course of his public life is a truly inclusive narrative, one that recognizes the ideals at our nation's core, the ways in which we've fallen short of them, and the steps we've taken to overcome those shortcomings. here's how he described that narrative on july 4, 2012:
on tuesday, senate democrats voted to advance a resolution that would allow for $1.9 trillion in new spending through a special process called budget reconciliation. legislation passed through budget reconciliation only needs a simple majority to pass. otherwise, democrats would need to win the support of at least 10 republicans in order to defeat a filibuster, which requires at least 60 votes to overcome.
in fact, i'm very pleased. we've got to deal with the crisis at hand. the president just created a crisis, he said.
(reporting by jon herskovitz; editing by bill rigby)
the aca will be repealed (and yes, that includes protections for pre-existing conditions).
but instead of convincing voters that she'd be the more politically effective candidate in this situation, clinton's gone all the way 'round the bend and has decided to ramp up unnecessary fearmongering, dispatching her daughter to new hampshire to darkly warn that sanders is gonna take everyone's health care away:
a ruling wiping out the affordable care act would be a blow to all of them, for the sake of an argument that has provoked outright derision from much of the legal establishment. andrew koppelman, a law professor at northwestern university who has also been critical of past challenges to the law, told huffpost on friday that i can't get through the logic without giggling, so maybe she can't either.
the issue at the heart of california v. texas is the affordable care act's individual mandate, which was also at issue in the 2012 ruling barrett criticized.
the immediate aftermath of beshear's somewhat shocking victory in a state trump won by nearly 30 points just three years ago led to searches for national meaning, even in a race defined by its distinctly local flavors.
this would work out as a nice tax break for people whose incomes, today, qualify them for only a little assistance or none at all. but it means that working- and middle-class people would tend to lose assistance that currently makes it possible for them to buy coverage in the first place.
i haven't seen any other account that is dedicated to hate 24-7 like this, maureen erwin said.
how would the republican medicaid scheme work? under the current system, state medicaid programs receive federal matching funds based on the number of people in need and the costs of care in that state. under the gop's proposal, medicaid would be radically restructured by forcing states to accept reductions in federal funding through either a per capita cap or a block grant, both of which would shrink federal funding for state medicaid programs over time, relative to current law, beginning with a cut as large as $1 trillion over ten years. simply put, the republican approach would effectively eliminate medicaid's guarantee of coverage, starve the program, and shift billions of dollars of costs to state taxpayers.

people are less likely to struggle with medical bills, and more likely to have a regular source of care, according to a 2015 paper in the journal of the american medical association that's one of the most comprehensive studies of the affordable care act.
lynch is not exactly the same as rep. dan lipinski, the conservative democrat from illinois whose anti-abortion, anti-lgbtq, hardline immigration and conservative health care views lost him his primary to progressive candidate marie newman earlier this year. but he's solidly a centrist — and a perennial target for progressives. after progressives, like reps. alexandria ocasio cortez (d-n.y.) and boston's ayanna pressley, successfully unseated longtime democrats in the 2018 midterms, sean mcelwee, the co-founder of liberal think tank data for progress, listed lynch's seat as prime territory for a progressive to win.
barrett's nomination has been the focus at a capitol mostly shut down by covid-19 protocols. the health care debate has been central to the week's hearings, as americans struggle during the pandemic, but barrett's views on racial equity and presidential power are also being questioned as senators try to unpack how she would rule on cases if confirmed.
on friday, for example, georgia gov. brian kemp (r) announced the trump administration will approve his plan to block georgians from using healthcare.gov and send them to insurance brokers instead, where they will see not only aca-compliant plans but also junk insurance. the plan also would impose work requirements on medicaid enrollees.
in an interview with the washington examiner, stockton admitted his motivations: we're not shy about that fact. we're out for revenge.
the fact that his new bill has attracted support from many other senators, including presidential front-runners, is a sign that politicians are really starting to listen to the people. adam gaffney, physicians for a national health plan
somebody call the situation room, because things are about to get hot, obama said.
today marks an important step toward restoring healthcare choices and affordability back to the american people, press secretary sean spicer said in a statement. president trump looks forward to working with both chambers of congress to repeal and replace obamacare.
under the rules of the budget reconciliation process ― a procedural mechanism republicans are using to avoid a democratic filibuster ― the senate's bill can't increase the deficit. the only way to free up money would be to keep more of obamacare's taxes in place ― and doing that risks losing the support of more conservative members who, all things being equal, would rather the senate bill look more like the house bill, not less.
and while 72% of democratic voters told the pollsters this month that they support medicare for all, that's down from 80% in april. but when asked to choose between medicare for all and proposals that augment the affordable care act, 36% of democrats chose medicare for all and 57% preferred plans that build upon obamacare.
since obamacare's passage in 2010, republicans had made repealing it their central campaign promise. if the country handed control of congress and the white house to the gop, they would finally dismantle it.
now, republicans are giving up on obamacare repeal as a campaign issue as well. anti-obamacare ad spending in the 2018 election cycle has plummeted compared to the same period in the previous three cycles, according to data compiled by kantar media/cmag for huffpost.
the court will hear the case in the fall — whether before the election or after, we don't yet know — with a decision to come in the spring of 2021, bagley said.
that appears to be the case in michigan as well. gov. rick snyder (r) is in some ways a throwback to a previous generation of republicans ― business-oriented pragmatists who reliably fell on the conservative side of economic policy, but who didn't hate the welfare state and who would work with democrats to expand social programs if they saw it as a chance to help citizens at a reasonable cost.
in other words, the standoff was mostly a question of manners.
such a backlash would surely be much bigger now. the affordable care act has become slightly more popular with time, democrats and their supporters are furious at republicans for blocking obama's supreme court nominee in his final year in office, and, perhaps most important, a large portion of the population now has a direct stake in the law.
health care costs that are not paid or reimbursed by insurance are passed on to the american people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums and higher fees for medical services, according to the white house statement. such costs have exceeded $35 billion in each of the last 10 years, amounting to approximately $7 million on average for each hospital in the u.s., the proclamation states.
moore is constantly, laughably wrong. in 1993, he said president bill clinton's slight income tax increase for the wealthiest americans would torpedo the economy. in 2009, he warned that federal budget deficits and the federal reserve's low interest rates were a recipe for hyperinflation, and then doubled down on that prediction. in 2010, he said surging prices would send the price of gold to $2,000 an ounce, as investors fled the worthless dollar for precious metals. none of these things ever happened. he spent much of 2018 applauding president donald trump's supposed efforts to shoot for zero tariffs, while trump actually imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
the mandate has always been unpopular ― even 2008 presidential candidate obama opposed it before taking office and changing his position ― and it won't be mourned by anyone but health insurance companies and some health care policy nerds.
you know, charlie and i were watching the news this morning, and they said that congress has just introduced a new age-rating bill, the wood-chopping narrator says. and i was like, 'what the heck is age rating?' then charlie explained that it's washington politician-speak for overcharging older americans for their health insurance while lining the insurance companies' pockets.
while mcconnell has been a prominent democratic boogeyman since at least the start of obama's administration, the democratic base is increasingly aware of mcconnell after his starring roles in the blockade of supreme court nominee merrick garland and the successful nomination of justice brett kavanaugh. the dscc's fundraising messages now focus heavily on mcconnell.
the proposal is also likely to prompt legal challenges, because it calls for changes that may exceed what executive agencies can do on their own, without new acts of congress.
in the name of reducing my anxiety, i went onto facebook and left all the political groups i'd joined. then i went onto twitter and unfollowed political accounts and newsgroups. finally, i told my irl friends that i was stepping back from talking politics.
government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family or class of men.(8)
exchange enrollees also must update their incomes if they rise or fall after enrollment. customers who receive too much subsidy could be required to repay it when they file their 2020 income taxes.
trump has yet to unveil his promised infrastructure initiative. elaine chao, his secretary of transportation, said wednesday that it would consist of a strategic, targeted program of investment valued at $1 trillion over 10 years. the plan, which chao said would be released sometime later this year, would include investment for energy, water and potentially broadband and veterans hospitals as well.
the problem for republicans is that their main objections to the aca ― that deductibles and premiums are too high and networks are too narrow ― can really only be solved by a combination of reducing the growth of costs and providing further subsidies for coverage. republicans in general have shown little willingness to spend more to help people pay for health care, but have instead argued that rolling back insurance regulations and unleashing the free market will do the trick. without significant subsidies, though, the industry has no way of covering those with pre-existing conditions, which republicans have promised any replacement will do.
it's happened that way before, although the cuts stick more frequently than skeptics assume. the affordable care act included significant reductions to hospitals, for example, and efforts to roll them back have failed.
many administrators of rural hospitals are quick to say that medicaid expansion alone will not solve their financial problems. rural hospitals faced steep challenges long before the aca.
in the midst of a pandemic, nearly 100 million americans do not have sufficient health insurance, barkan said. even good insurance does not cover essential needs like long-term care ― our loved ones are dying in unsafe nursing homes, our nurses are overwhelmed and unprotected.
― paige lavender & sara boboltz
there's been zero action on the issue in congress, where republicans seem tired of talking about it and confronting their own failure. trump himself has never articulated a vision of what he thinks the health care system should look like, and has been making empty, ludicrous and false promises since his campaign for the presidency began.
the above is an edited excerpt from kevin powell's latest book, my mother. barack obama. donald trump. and the last stand of the angry white man available wherever books are sold on sept. 4.
trump had his pulse on something very real, said irene lin, a cleveland-based democratic campaign consultant. rhetorically and politically, it was brilliant.
right now, people who buy coverage through the exchanges can choose from a range of policies, from cheap bronze policies that cover relatively little to expensive platinum policies that cover nearly everything. the affordable care act also discounts premiums, through a system of tax credits, with a goal of making sure anybody can get a silver plan for no more than about 10% of their income.
but after a promising start, clinton's campaign has taken an abrupt, confused, strategic turn. and a familiar crassness has returned to a campaign that now appears to be bent on ensuring a repeat of 2008 in 2016.
there is little democrats can do to stop barrett's nomination from moving forward if republicans remain unified behind her. but barrett's views against the constitutionality of the affordable care act and abortion rights could harm both trump's reelection and republican chances of holding control of the senate.
even then, however, the justice department broke with the plaintiffs by asking the courts to invalidate only one portion of the law ― specifically, the new regulations on private insurance and pre-existing conditions. a major purpose of the financial penalty for people without insurance — a provision also known as the individual mandate ― had been to make those regulations function more effectively.
but the lawsuit has already won in a u.s. district court, and late last year its core argument carried the day before a three-judge panel from the u.s. 5th circuit court of appeals.
as for congressional intent, the lawmakers who voted to zero out the mandate in 2017 were fully aware that they were removing a piece of the program while letting the law stand ― and they were quite obviously ok with that, because that is how they voted.
the quandary that republicans across the board find themselves in — you can never really separate yourself from trump even if that's what might do best for you, taylor said. he has the potential to pick off more african american voters than president trump might be on course to pick up there, but the math still seems pretty hard for them unless the national climate and the climate in michigan changes for republicans.
i think there are a group of people who voted for him just because they couldn't vote for hillary, she added, and now they feel somewhat responsible for all the angst that's going on, and they don't want it rubbed in their face.
with a small handful of exceptions, scholars examining data from the last few years have found that the law had no significant impact on payroll hours ― except, perhaps, an uptick in workers (like near-retirees) who had wanted to cut back on hours all along, but had been holding onto full-time work purely for the sake of keeping coverage. with the affordable care act in place, they were able to move to part-time.
forget about who has insurance, they say. what matters is access to health care ― and republican plans will make it better.
the budget resolution came with instructions to pass up to $1.9 trillion in additional spending that democrats say they want to put toward $1,400 checks, extending unemployment insurance programs currently set to expire in march through september, and increasing jobless benefits to $400 per week instead of the current $300. they also want to pass $350 billion in funding for states, cities and tribes, as well as funds for vaccines, schools, public transit and more.
republicans got their wish. in 2016, voters gave them control of the white house and both chambers of congress. yet their repeal attempts have failed, and the law has grown in popularity.
for pratt, the medicaid expansion campaign is a chance to prove that the people of idaho can make change, even when their elected representatives won't. she wants to win not only because she believes in the cause of expanding health coverage, but to prove a point to the lawmakers in boise and washington, d.c.
moulton instead referred to the pac's prerequisites, which include targeting candidates best poised to help take back the house. we're actually being very selective, he said.
but in the brief laying out the case for taking things slow, trump's justice department lawyers made a curious statement: they said the affordable care act's supposedly unconstitutional provision has no practical impact.
like all such proposals, thursday's is dense and will require several days for experts to parse fully. but the gist seems clear. the regulation would modify the regulatory treatment of ahps so that small businesses and certain individuals ― in particular, sole proprietors who are part of the same industry or live in the same area ― would have access to plans that don't comply with all of obamacare's insurance rules, including the requirement to cover those 10 essential benefits.
tonight, i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.
the problem with that -- as the proliferation of high-deductible plans in the last decade or so is showing -- is that patients sometimes just go without health care and don't do a very good job differentiating between care they need and care they could do without. and, again, health savings accounts aren't much use to people who don't have the spare income to deposit money into them.
the number of malnourished children could rise by 20%, to 2.4 million, by the end of the year. the situation in yemen is expected to get worse as donor countries cut aid.
moore, unscathed, has bounced from the cato institute to the club for growth to the heritage foundation, happily absorbing the excess capital of conservative think-tank donors in the market for a white guy with the courage to advocate tax cuts. on friday, in what would be the economist's greatest, most frightening achievement, trump announced that he will nominate moore to the federal reserve's board of governors.
with this budget resolution, the democratic congress is paving the way for the landmark biden-harris coronavirus package that will crush the virus and deliver real relief to families and communities in need, senate majority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) and house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said in a joint statement. we are hopeful that republicans will work in a bipartisan manner to support assistance for their communities, but the american people cannot afford any more delays and the congress must act to prevent more needless suffering.
that's true for a portion of people who have this coverage. but the cumulative impact of all plans conservative intellectuals and republican lawmakers are circulating would be to expose people to even higher out-of-pocket medical costs.
after trump's win, mekelburg celebrated on twitter, but not for long. she had more hate and lies to amplify. she tweeted that anti-fascists were responsible for train derailments and that the dnc and the media caused the death of protester heather heyer in charlottesville, virginia. not once did she criticize trump's racist and fascist supporters. instead, she scapegoated muslims for mass shootings carried out by white supremacists and far-right gun nuts such as stephen paddock, who massacred 58 people in las vegas last year. mekelburg used islamic state propaganda to support her own:
they argue that the mandate itself is a tax because it forces americans to buy health insurance, and the tax credit is paid directly to insurance companies, not to individual taxpayers.
he's been in government 47 years, trump said. he never did a thing ― except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community.
equally noteworthy is who ernst and hegar don't mention in their videos: trump. the use of mcconnell but not the president (trump won both iowa and texas by fairly substantial margins in 2016) shows how democrats believe mcconnell has become a fairly nonpartisan villain, a symbol of corruption and, as one strategist put it, the least sympathetic man in washington. democrats hope they can use mcconnell's reputation to turn even swing voters who still like and trust the president against the gop.
the fact that you have a competitive race is the first indication that things have changed, ernest mcnealy, the president of allen university, a historically black college in columbia, said. certainly jaime harrison will be difficult to categorize ... but the fact that he is an african american and is in a competitive race against a long-serving senator speaks to changes that are afoot not only in the state but in the country.
others were among the ranks of the uninsured because they couldn't afford health insurance, and being poor is associated with being less healthy. and people in both categories may have had ailments that weren't discovered until they gained coverage and visited medical providers. in addition, people with serious medical conditions previously covered by special high-risk pool insurance programs transitioned into the regular market.
obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. do not worry! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 25, 2017
when i took office, isis controlled more than 20,000 square miles in iraq and syria. today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
granted, the rich are adept at giving back in charity drives and galas ― after the fact of accumulating their base wealth working the system to their gross advantage.
ending the affordable care act would take away guarantees of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, eliminate tax credits for people who buy health insurance on their own, and cut off federal support for expanded state medicaid programs.
according to a detroit free press and epic-mra poll in mid-october, peters led by 6 percentage points over opponent john james, one of republicans' strongest recruits in the 2020 election cycle. but that survey had a larger-than-expected chunk of undecided voters: 11% of the total surveyed electorate and, notably, 18% of black voters. this week, a fox news poll found just 5% of likely voters were still undecided.
leaders might try to win over holdouts like sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska), who has said she wants to protect her state's medicaid population, by offering extra money for alaska ― much as democrats in 2009 used special funding for nebraska to bring along then-sen. ben nelson (d-neb.) in what became known as the cornhusker kickback. maybe they could win over capito and portman with extra money for opioid treatment as a way to replace a little bit of the money their states would lose from medicaid.
biden noted that obama signed a law reducing the disparity in punishments for possession of powder cocaine and crack, which had resulted in black americans facing harsher penalties for possession and trafficking of a similar drug in a different form.
and trump could not resist revisiting the subject on wednesday. in a speech at a tank plant in lima, ohio, trump complained that he gave mccain the kind of funeral that he wanted, but didn't get a thank you.
hillary's campaign needed some emotional momentum
if you have kids, medicaid is definitely worth looking at in every state, pollitz said. this is free, comprehensive coverage. parents can check their children's eligibility and apply for coverage by visiting insurekidsnow.gov. adults can check their own eligibility via benefits.gov.
states could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. that would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.
in addition, uva is making a comprehensive review of its charity care rules and considering policies to provide additional financial assistance to low-income patients not covered by our existing charity care policies, he said.
it's been an issue in the last decade that's animated republicans in congress in their zeal to overturn the aca, sen. pat leahy (d-vt.) said tuesday while questioning barrett at her confirmation hearing. republicans in congress voted to repeal or gut the aca more than 70 times in the last 10 years. when they failed, they turned to the court.
kavanaugh called roe v. wade, the landmark reproductive rights supreme court opinion, an important precedent that has been reaffirmed many times, including in the planned parenthood v. casey case.
president donald trump, along with multiple republican lawmakers, has publicly denounced roberts for his role in those decisions.
by writing the regulations in this way, the obama administration had two goals in mind. one was to protect consumers by making sure all policies were sufficiently comprehensive to cover all medical needs. the other was to ensure all individuals and small businesses were part of the same insurance pool, so that there were enough healthy people paying premiums to cover the high bills of those who needed extensive medical care.
naturally, another of trump's big ideas is to increase the use of health savings accounts paired with high-deductible health insurance policies, a go-to gop policy proposal. the theory behind these -- other than the accounts serving as tax shelters for people who can afford to sock away money in them -- is that health care consumers with more skin in the game will become smarter shoppers, demand lower prices for health care and products and drive down national health care spending.
the first principle is that you're not helpless. the first step is to feel empowered, and not just to write the check but to start asking questions ― even before you see the doctor or go to the hospital.
in 2016, when donald trump was running for president, his plan was a promise of something terrific and a few bullet points. it had zero relation to what he and the republicans tried to accomplish once he got into office.
health care in the u.s. is so expensive that comprehensive insurance, the kind generous enough to provide real protection from medical bills, is costly even for most middle-class families. a typical employer policy for a family costs nearly $19,000, according to last year's hret/henry j. kaiser family foundation annual study, although few americans realize it because employers are paying most of the bill directly.
he is one of the many disabled who are lobbying for a reduction in the ma spend-down. raising the spend-down limit to just the poverty level will allow those living off their ssdi to keep more money in their checkbook and to pay other living expenses. it will cost $27m biennium, but is a whole lot less than the cost of putting these individuals into an assisted care facility.
the senate's bill most striking measure would slash medicaid by almost a trillion dollars through cutting back on federal funding over a decade. that will affect all aspects of health coverage (for example, medicaid covers 40 percent of all children's basic health care). but it will also have a major impact on mental health: medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health services in the country.

the legislation also includes a subtle change in language that would make some washington lobbying firms eligible for forgivable loans from the paycheck protection program, which is designed to help small businesses retain their employees despite the economic fallout from the covid-19 pandemic. specifically, the bill allows a host of previously excluded nonprofits, including the political advocacy groups known as 501(c)(4)s and trade associations that lobby for groups of corporations, to access those ppp small business loans.
these public option alternatives represent less change than medicare for all ― which you can see as a strength, a weakness, or both.
the rule will take effect in 60 days, administration officials said, although it is likely to invite legal challenge. it appears the trump administration is restricting short-term plans to 364 days at a pop in order to distinguish them from more traditional, full-year policies that are subject to all of the affordable care act's requirements. it's not clear whether judges will find the distinction meaningful.
we must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
after winning the election, trump revised his proposals to bring them closer to orthodox republican ideas like cutting medicaid funding and promoting tax-free health savings accounts. the only thing consistent about his views is that whatever comes after the affordable care act will be terrific and better and less expensive.
meanwhile, some people who need or want more comprehensive coverage will have to pay more for it, as the study predicts premiums for such plans will rise 18 percent. and the federal government, which subsidizes plans for lower-income consumers through tax credits, will have to spend more money.

the idea of creating a single national health insurance program for all americans has been a big topic of political conversation since 2016, when sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) touted it during his democratic presidential campaign. but medicare for all couldn't be anything more than a rallying cry as long as republicans controlled the levers of power in washington.
although buttigieg has said he would like to see medicare for all in the u.s. someday, he has warned that trying to establish a version of it right away would be difficult given public skittishness about such a sweeping change and the practical complications of transforming one-sixth of the u.s. economy.
the character of the campaign, the tone of the campaign, the way you are trying to persuade those undecided voters seems to have changed a little bit in the last week or so. just this afternoon, your campaign, in my estimation, set its hair on fire a little bit, maddow told the candidate, pointing to a press phone call that happened earlier that day in which clinton's campaign asserted that sanders attacked her in his latest ad.
the subjects of the senate finance committee's hearings were just as vague: comprehensive tax reform, individual tax reform and international tax reform. the hearings totaled 11 in the house and senate. forty-five witnesses were called, never more than five per hearing. nearly half came from inside the beltway. none dealt with specifics because the tax bill was still being drafted — in secret.
but the gop's whole rationale for repeal has always been that they have a better, cheaper way to achieve the aca's core goals, including its protection of people with pre-existing conditions. they have no such alternative, as last year's repeal fight in congress revealed. the question for the midterms is whether voters will notice that republicans are making the same empty promises as before.

by and large, they are in competitive hospital markets, large and urban, says len nichols, a health economist at george mason university. they have no choice but to become more efficient, for unlike their less-efficient brethren, they can't just charge the private sector what they want.
in one particularly inscrutable sequence, biden started talking about republican attacks on obamacare, then shifted his focus to the insurance deductibles his proposal would allow, and then said the real deductibles to worry about were the high costs of medicare for all. harris responded by talking about insurance company profits, the drug industry's role in the opioid crisis and the high cost of insulin. and all of that was in the span of about 45 seconds.
but trump told the wall street journal this week that he believes a threat to the viability of the insurance marketplaces could be leverage to force democrats to the negotiating table. democratic leaders have forcefully rejected this gambit and demanded that money for the cost-sharing subsidies be included in a pending federal spending bill.
another new analysis, which the urban institute published wednesday, looked at all the changes in federal revenue and spending ― the lower taxes on wealthy americans, the loss of medicaid and financial assistance for the poor and middle class. it found that households with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty line (about $49,000 per year for a family of four) would see net losses of income, while households with incomes above 300 percent of the poverty line (about $73,000 for a family of four) would see net gains. and families with incomes of six times the poverty line, or about $146,000 a year for a family of four, would see the greatest gains of all.
that means that by the deadline we're going to have the vast majority of signatures that we need collected by volunteers, because we're likely to get at least 10,000 or 15,000 more in the next six weeks, mayville said.

the trump administration's extraction-friendly environmental protection agency signaled in may that it planned to let the project proceed, but the army corps of engineers, citing its own environmental concerns, stalled the mine's construction in august.
trump has long talked up ahps in the same way that conservatives have, by promoting them as a cheaper alternative for individuals and small businesses struggling with high premiums. but the policies could leave beneficiaries exposed to bigger, potentially crippling medical bills, because the plans don't have to cover all of the essential benefits. the plans could also draw healthier people away from more comprehensive policies, forcing insurers to raise prices on those policies, which people with ongoing medical problems need in order to cover their expenses.
i would say we're at a tipping point where it's become pretty unsustainable. we saw this at some of the town hall meetings recently, when people started to realize that repealing the affordable care act would affect their own insurance.

if you ask voters the number one thing they hate about the republican health care agenda, it's that it overturns protections for people with pre-existing conditions, ferguson said. to quote the president, 'a lot of health care is complicated,' but coverage for people with diabetes and asthma is really clear, understandable and something people no longer trust republicans on.

with the possibility of a blankenship victory dominating media coverage heading into the west virginia primary, democrats saw an advantage. operatives in both parties have long tried to meddle in the other side's primaries to boost toxic candidates like blankenship, and it would only be natural for democrats to do the same.
he and his wife made, on average, over $20 million a year in investment income and $1.6 million a year in ordinary wages over the 10-year period for which gianforte disclosed his earnings. assuming he continued to maintain this average going forward, he would get a $772,981 annual tax break from repeal of the net investment income tax and another $12,432 from elimination of the medicare hospital insurance surtax.
all health care systems ration care one way or another. there are good ways and bad ways to do it. ours is a bad and irrational way. it allows for excess, often inappropriate and ineffective care for those who can pay and exclusion of those who suffer worse outcomes due to lack of access and affordability. it is unfair and inhumane when so many millions of americans cannot gain access to necessary care because of financial barriers. as a result, we have a system of rationing based on ability to pay without regard to medical need. moreover, we still have no significant containment of prices and costs of health care as well as the worst health care outcomes compared to ten other advanced countries, including canada.

it looks as if senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is trying to do the same thing by having his caucus work out a deal behind closed doors and then bring it to the floor right when he is within striking distance of a majority. sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) is among the senators who aren't happy about the process. on tuesday, that irritation came to a boiling point for him.
in his resignation statement, farenthold reflected on his time spent working to make government more efficient and responsive, cut government spending, repeal obamacare, protect life and reduce the debt.
within a year, voters had taken notice, characterizing him in polling as far more conservative than they'd thought when he was a candidate.

health care is one of the most personal of issues ― far more so than tax cuts, which is what republicans apparently want to run on this cycle ― and democrats are using it in powerful campaign ads. health care costs are still a significant concern for people, and the gop has largely dropped any efforts to make health care more affordable.
people on twitter are furious about president donald trump's latest floated plan to get rid of obamacare — by simply killing it now and replacing it at a later date. but twitter wags didn't discount the strategy entirely. they thought it might work for trump himself: impeach now, replace later.

for as long as anyone can remember, new york city has called like a siren to freedom-seekers hoping for a chance to make their own way in the world. for centuries, scrappy capitalists like the dutch fur traders, alexander hamilton, and mario batali have migrated to the economic epicenter of manhattan, their presence challenged only by equally seduced hordes of writers, musicians, and bohemians such as f. scott fitzgerald, john lennon, and taylor swift. the conception of the city as the place to go to become somebody is one that has not and likely will not change; it is the singular element of the island's identity that remains constant, as its skyline grows higher and its social fabric evolves. this dynamic is as significant today as it was hundreds of years ago. for just as prohibition-thwarting bootleggers sprinkled downtown with exclusive charm by building mysterious, raucous speakeasies, and european immigration waves bestowed upon the boroughs the highest authority regarding pizza and bagels, this summer, a new group of dreamers and schemers has made its mark on the urban landscape. they have kept the city's economic institutions alive by the relentless flow of their vigorous labor, all while making their very best effort to drink its saloons and rooftop lounges dry. please allow me to introduce: the new york city summer interns.
the president addressed house and senate democrats in the same auditorium where, almost exactly seven years ago, he exhorted them to pass sweeping health care reform legislation aimed at covering the uninsured, reducing health costs and improving the quality of medical care.
but republicans appear aware of aarp's power ― or are at least sensitive to concerns about how older voters will respond to the law. house republican leaders have added $85 billion to the bill for extra tax credits to help workers over 50 afford insurance under the law, politico reported monday.
some want to build on the affordable care act's reforms, by finding ways to lower premiums that leave protections for people with pre-existing conditions in place. but that's not the approach gop leaders in most of the states prefer ― and it's not the approach they're talking about in topeka.
it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the senate that would address daca, border security, and related issues as well as disaster relief, defense funding, health care, and other important matters, mcconnell said. it would be my strong preference for the senate to consider a proposal that can actually be signed into law, a bipartisan, bicameral group is already negotiating, and i look forward to completion of its work.
in both speeches, president obama took aim at the presumptive republican nominee -- without mentioning his name. on the idea that we need someone who will make america great again:
that includes three large states in the south ― florida, georgia, and texas. if every state were fully participating in the expansion, as the affordable care act's architects originally envisioned, roughly 2.5 million more people could have health insurance today.
in just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom ― a boom that has rarely been seen before. we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs ― something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.
the trade-off likely helped the biden campaign, which is continuing to reach out to moderate and conservative voters turned off by trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. it's unlikely they'll lose much support from more liberal voters, who polling indicates are not abandoning biden in numbers significant enough to have any effect on the election.
the ministries have many satisfied members, including people who might otherwise not be able to afford coverage. some find them to be more personal and nurturing than huge, faceless insurance companies. but as the ministries attract a broader group of customers and market themselves more aggressively as an alternative to obamacare, they are drawing increasing concern from consumer advocates and regulators.
that was 44 years ago and while the subject of abortion remains uncomfortable for many, it is important that we acknowledge the significance of this decision. roe vs. wade affirmed that abortion was, and still is, basic healthcare.
the medicaid expansion problem is trickiest in the senate, where leadership can stand to lose only two votes and still pass a reconciliation bill repealing obamacare, assuming every democrat votes against it.
but more importantly, as my buddy cenk uygur of the young turks pointed out, hillary is not entitled to the votes or support of bernie's supporters -- she needs to earn them. the passion and enthusiasm of berners can't simply be signed over to hillary because she's the democratic nominee, especially if berners see her as merely the lesser of two evils. she needs to commit to some of the same progressive goals and ideals bernie champions, and in a way that doesn't feel like lip service, empty promises, or simply pandering for votes. this is a tall order considering how many voters find hillary to be fundamentally untrustworthy, but it's also why berners' support for hillary shouldn't be treated as a given.
q: sounds appealing. what's the problem?
insurers could charge higher premiums to people who did not maintain continuous coverage ― a lapse of more than 63 days ― 30 percent more for their policies when they sign up again. it's not clear that insurers would consider this adequate to protect against massive losses ― and that could mean a rapid destabilization of insurance markets, which in many states are already fragile, and a quick spike in the number of people without coverage. the bill also eliminates the penalties large employers pay when workers receive health insurance subsidies because the company didn't offer health benefits.
the questioning grew tense after trump interrupted to dispute claims that the aca, also known as obamacare, had already protected those with preexisting conditions.
about one in five american adults will be affected by a mental illness annually. not having access to proper treatment for those disorders can be catastrophic: data shows untreated mental health issues is one of the most frequent causes of suicide ― major public health problem that's been steadily on the rise over the last 15 years.

weakening the individual mandate could very well sabotage the individual insurance market, levitt said.
that possibility is why health care is suddenly getting a lot more attention in the campaign, and undoubtedly why biden kept bringing it up on tuesday.
but as the two nights of presidential debates between the 2020 candidates illustrated, it's sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and his sweeping medicare for all plan that is now the benchmark for progressive health care reform. it's appropriate, considering that sanders' serious challenge to clinton in 2016 moved the notion of single-payer health care into the democratic mainstream.
medicaid benefits also can be retroactive up to three months. that means the program can cover medical costs incurred by a person who was eligible but not enrolled ― which is helpful if it takes a newly unemployed person a while to figure all this out. medicaid and chip enrollment is available year-round.

in minnesota and new york, people with incomes too high for medicaid have another option: the affordable care act's basic health program. minnesota's minnesotacare and new york's essential plan are open to people who earn up to twice the poverty level, which is about $32,000 for a single person. new yorkers may have to pay up to $20 a month for the essential plan, and minnesotans may have to pay up to $80 a month for minnesotacare coverage.

brady didn't respond to requests for comment about the center's analysis.
those state officials maintain that the affordable care act's individual mandate is now unconstitutional because congress repealed the tax penalties owed by those who fail to comply with it. and, further, they say the entire law must fall if the mandate doesn't conform to the constitution.
of course, when you ask republicans about their rhetorical shift, they largely deny it. but then, republicans have already embraced a revisionist history about some of their more unpopular policy efforts.

by the standards of past democratic campaigns, biden's proposal is ambitious and progressive. it feels timid only because sanders and other democrats are touting the more ambitious and more progressive medicare for all ― an idea that, biden says, would be too disruptive to existing insurance arrangements (since everybody would give up their existing insurance) and to the health care system more generally (since government would start paying everybody's bills).

in connecticut, residents will soon be able to take advantage of a paid family medical leave plan that passed in the 2019 legislative session. the law is one of the most generous plans in the country, allowing residents to take up to three months off with pay if they or a family member become sick or if they have a baby. although lamont previously said he would veto the bill, he signed the plan into law on tuesday.
there is good news in the battle over health care – gop members of congress are getting pummeled in their districts for trying to take away their constituents' obamacare. voters overwhelmingly oppose repealing the affordable care act (aca) without an adequate replacement, and obamacare is more popular than ever in the polls. at the same time, the republican timeline for repeal is slipping (and slipping), they still don't have anything remotely close to a replacement plan, and there is growing division within the gop's ranks about what to do.

cutting those payments too dramatically can cause major disruptions in the health care industry, but without those dramatic cuts, any plan can quickly become too expensive.
democrats weren't as successful as they'd hoped to be last year during a cycle in which teacher anger and big money from a high-profile congressional race had the party dreaming of a bigger shake-up in the state than the one seat they gained in the state house. but there were positive signs: democrats flipped seven gop-held seats in districts trump won in 2016 (they lost six seats they'd previously held in trump districts), and carved into the gop's popular vote majority in legislative races, which shrunk from 20 points in 2016 to just 8 last year. democrats also elected 18 women to the kentucky general assembly, double their previous record.

a hidden factor in all of this, udow-phillips said, has been the influence of organized labor and its ability to demand good insurance for members.
even if the vote on friday goes smoothly, this would just be the first in a series of votes to repeal and replace obamacare. in some ways, this should be the easiest vote. republicans are merely setting up the process to begin a repeal. but as they grapple with more details about a replacement, and as leadership tries to push a repeal through before republicans ever start debating a replacement ― or even hold a hearing on the impact of getting rid of obamacare ― a once-easy messaging vote might prove more difficult than leaders have let on.
as more people continue to travel, customers may notice that flights are booked to capacity starting july 1, the carrier said in a statement.
health care policy is all about tradeoffs, so for all these changes, there would be counter-effects, including a reduction in taxes on the wealthy that the affordable care act raised to finance its coverage expansions. but the effects of invalidation of the aca would be devastating to our entire health care system, said timothy jost, a law professor emeritus at washington and lee.
i think they are just being wholly partisan with these endless filibusters, ryan added, referring to the failed senate votes. the senate has been blatantly political with zika funding.
some republicans also find it lacking.

polls from both the new york times and washington post released sunday showed biden with a steady and substantial lead over trump, and more trusted by a majority of voters to pick the new supreme court justice.
last fall, in the wake of the release of doctored videos produced, likely illegally, by an anti-abortion group, the republicans demanded the creation of a select panel to investigate planned parenthood. we know this new investigation will lead us nowhere, because the three house committees and eight states that have investigated planned parenthood have already found no wrongdoing. in addition, the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee (one of the committees that investigated planned parenthood), jason chaffetz, said, i'm not suggesting that they broke the law.
regardless, beshear's victory will have a major impact on kentucky, where he has pledged to boost funding for public education, raise teacher pay and overhaul the school board bevin stocked with his own appointees, many of them hostile to public schooling. beshear plans to end bevin's efforts to roll back kentucky's medicaid expansion, which he said will protect health care for 95,000 kentuckians, and restore voting rights to 140,000 convicted felons in a state with one of the country's highest rates of disenfranchisement.
janet lyness, the county attorney in johnson county, iowa, made the list because she donated to the campaign of mazahir salih, a muslim woman who became the first sudanese-american elected to public office in the united states when she won a city council seat in iowa city last year.
tyson is doing much better now. her health is stable and, after two years of unemployment, she's now working at a hospital. that job has excellent health benefits, she said, which means she doesn't need assistance from aca programs. but she understands very well that others do.

here's what i now know about tinder, from a conscious woman's perspective: it's like the grocery store -- there are people there for all sorts of reasons, spanning from one end of the spectrum to the other. there's the sadist offering to train you to the evangelical ceo who made it clear that christ was first and foremost in his life. however, i met nice guys, made new friends and had fun. i saw profiles with no words--this might be the hook-up' clue... swipe left. and i read some really cute ones. my all-time favorite was from an adorable doctor:
on nbc, trump was defensive about his administration's handling of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 217,000 lives in the united states. angry and combative, trump refused to denounce the qanon conspiracy group — and only testily did so regarding white supremacists.
have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?
with insulin specifically, the problem has become especially acute, if a bit complicated. the average price of an insulin prescription basically doubled between 2012 and 2016, according to the health care cost institute.
the majority of the moderators in the 2016 and 2018 democratic debates were men, and predominantly white men. but the democratic national committee instituted a new rule for the 2020 election cycle mandating that every debate have a female moderator. it also encouraged news outlets hosting debates to include people of color.
they didn't run this by the politicians. they didn't look at it seriously in terms of its effect on republican voters and [donald] trump voters, said jost, who is also a contributing editor at health affairs.
under trump, the federal government has encouraged states and health insurance companies to reintroduce junk insurance with few benefits and huge potential out-of-pocket costs that make the worst obamacare plans look good by comparison. the trump administration has pushed states to seek new limitations on coverage of low-income adults on medicaid, including work requirements. arkansas, the first state to adopt work requirements, has quickly proven that the policy is working as intended and has kicked 18,000 people off their health coverage in less than a year.
a key question for democrats is whether the different approaches they are discussing have to be mutually exclusive. in principle, once the more incremental changes are in place, they can provide a platform for creating something more comprehensive. if the federal government is already setting drug prices, for instance, it's less of a leap ― as politics and as policy ― to have it set prices for doctors and hospitals too.
this is pretty much the opposite of the insurance for everybody and great health care that trump has repeatedly promised to deliver. yet, one reason the case has gotten this far — prevailing in front of a conservative district judge whose decision prompted the appeal to the 5th circuit — is that the federal government isn't defending the law as it customarily would.
a commonwealth fund study, in fact, showed that the cbo was more right in its forecasts about the affordable care act than anyone else.
yet uva offers financial assistance that's more limited than any other major health system in virginia, according to an analysis of policies at organizations including inova, sentara healthcare, riverside health and carilion clinic.
with the recess just days away, many lawmakers who have delayed making a judgment about opening an impeachment inquiry will be able to get out of the capitol without having to comment on the hearing.
there's been more spending on this senate race than on the presidential race in the state. state campaign finance watchers estimate the price tag of the race could be more than $100 million by election day.
vukmir has clearly identified herself as part of the establishment and holds official support from the wisconsin gop. in contrast, nicholson has portrayed himself as an outsider and touts his experience as a marine ― but he still faces doubts because of his past, which includes being president of college democrats of america and speaking at a democratic convention.
greenville is the reddest part of a very red state, according to kate howard franch, the chair of the local democratic party. rep. trey gowdy (r-s.c.), who led the benghazi committee, is their congressman, if that gives any indication of the area's leanings.
there aren't many insurance companies that offer this kind of consumer protection, he said.
well, still the medicaid expansion piece, and whether the tax credits are sufficient at the lower end, she said, referring to credits afforded to older americans who face higher premiums under the house bill. those are the two biggest.
conspicuous among them is jonathan adler, a law professor at case western reserve university, who has written and spoken extensively about the case ― and filed a brief with bagley urging the courts to reject the lawsuit.
if they pass their bills, it will be a major step toward pushing legislation through congress to the desk of president donald trump ― who, along with gop leaders, has made repeal of obamacare a top priority.
for five years, the mysterious twitter account ― which has more than 200,000 followers, including sean hannity, roseanne barr and the personal account of sarah huckabee sanders, and has earned endorsements from donald trump and michael flynn ― has tirelessly spewed far-right propaganda and, above all, islamophobia. around 25 tweets a day, sometimes more, the majority of them designed to stoke hatred of muslims.
it turned out to be a one-off, replaced by images of the idling of iconic factories like the general motors plant in lordstown, ohio, a region where trump told voters in july 2017 not to sell their homes because the lost manufacturing jobs were all coming back.
exchange enrollees also must update their incomes if they rise or fall after enrollment. customers who receive too much subsidy could be required to repay it when they file their 2020 income taxes.
and if barrett isn't on the court in time to hear the case, there's the possibility of a 4-4 tie with ginsburg's seat unfilled, which would send the case back to the lower courts for more litigation or a decision to rehear it with all nine justices in place.
ryan's one big victory was on taxes ― he was instrumental in writing and passing the bill that president donald trump signed late last year. it will dramatically reduce what the wealthiest americans pay, realizing one of ryan's long-held dreams.

inslee shot back: we can't work it out. our house is on fire.
but that is looking more and more a long-term project, especially given that california has been talking about single-payer for years (decades, actually) and the necessary political support for it remains elusive. in the meantime, the new budget agreement will help significant numbers of californians who are either struggling with high premiums or who have no insurance at all, helping california to realize the full potential of the affordable care act while moving the state closer to universal coverage.
when it comes to those broad beliefs, all of the available signs suggest the public is on democrats' side.
the stakes in november transcend ideological preferences or partisan differences: they cut to the essence of america itself. who will govern us ― the party of white identity, or one that respects our common humanity? will we combat, or promote, hatred and violence? will we broaden opportunity and security for all, or suffocate hope by empowering plutocracy?
on sunday, a judge for the same district blocked an obama administration policy that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, granting a nationwide injunction sought by 13 states, led by texas.
it is plain, as it has been during trump's entire presidency, that he is utterly unconcerned about people in need. it is just as plain that this cruel and spiteful move is rooted at least in part in trump's obsession with tearing down anything his predecessor barack obama did.
new york's legislative session began and ended with lawmakers taking strides toward voting and election reform. lawmakers passed a series of voting rights bills, including early voting, pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds, consolidating what used to be two primary days, and moving the party enrollment deadline closer to the primary.
peters unexpectedly won an election in 2014 — a year democrats lost it all — and has spent his time in the senate in the minority party. james failed to win in a democratic wave two years ago. this year will be just as difficult.
but polls have shown protections for pre-existing conditions to be exceedingly popular, even among republican voters. a chance to show voters that hawley and morrisey would get rid of those protections could help keep those two seats in democratic hands.

here's more on the group's role in helping trump reshape federal courts, from huffpost's jen bendery.
it's also possible that bevin has overestimated the state's conservative shift, especially on economic issues. he might have been fine had he stopped after signing an anti-union right to work law and repealing the state's prevailing wage provision, as he and the new republican legislature did immediately after taking control in 2017. but he didn't.
the egalitarian nature of newsom's scheme could avoid one of the pitfalls of paid leave: putting women at a disadvantage in the workplace. mothers wind up taking long workforce leaves, and fathers don't. under his plan, if parents want their child to have six months of care provided by a family member, fathers would theoretically have to step up. mothers still take the majority of leave in the state.
the judge cited two cases in which he upheld campaign contribution limits while serving on the d.c. circuit court and said the supreme court generally upholds the limits unless they are too low.

i've gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
the democratic debate over the future of the health care system has become notably more pointed in recent weeks. in new hampshire over the weekend, biden repeatedly took issue with other democratic plans that he said would take too long to enact.
the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services — which was harshly criticized last year for a similar move — insists the maintenance downtime occurs every year and will take place during the lowest-traffic periods for as little time as possible.
my whole career, i've been able to get a lot of things done. i know i've been criticized by some on the far left because i think, actually, we should work with republicans, biden told a gathering of the international brotherhood of electrical workers not long before he launched his bid.
i know that this is not a moment to retreat to the past but to step boldly into our future, mcclellan states. we must rebuild our economy stronger, more inclusive, without leaving people behind.
prominent african americans who have cut ads for harrison in the past few weeks include former president barack obama and oscar-winning actor viola davis, a south carolina native. the candidate also campaigned this week with radio personality charlamagne tha god, a charleston native and host of the breakfast club, as well as rapper common, who toured a black barbershop and a historically black university.

conway also offered a let them eat cake defense of the bill, saying that people who lose coverage,if they are able-bodied and they want to work, can go get jobs that provide coverage. only thing is, as jonathan cohn writes, the majority of able-bodied adults on medicaid already have jobs. the problem is that they work as parking lot attendants and child care workers, manicurists and dishwashers ― in other words, low-paying jobs that typically don't offer insurance. take away their medicaid and they won't be covered.
and if it's going to get out of committee, it will likely need the support of susan collins (r-maine), putting planned parenthood in a complicated relationship with a senator who is increasingly the focus of progressive anger.

if we stop giving them things to do, i'm worried that people will get apathetic, said lopez, the executive director of the travis county democratic party in texas. it's only february, but typically after an election, this is the time when people are apathetic.
i think we might just win this thing, state senate minority leader morgan mcgarvey, a louisville liberal, said recently.
i saw this coming not because i'm uniquely prescient, but because i began writing reality-based political novels 20 years ago. i hung around with party pros, consultants, lobbyists, donors, pollsters, officeholders and political partisans, some of whom became my friends. bit by bit, i saw the party sell out its agenda for short-term gains with disastrous long-term consequences. eventually the gop's train wreck became inevitable -- no longer a matter of if, but when.
it felt liberating, gaffigan wrote, saying he was tired of censoring himself for the pro-trump crowd, and believes many others hold their tongue for the same reason.
whether or not that's a direct byproduct of the trump administration's policy changes, it's a reminder that the futures of people with substance abuse disorders depend not only on what happens in their homes and communities, but also on what happens in washington.
without looking at the experience of countries around the world with one or another kind of universal coverage, opponents of single-payer national health insurance (nhi) claim that it will ration care to their detriment. but they deny or seem unaware that we already ration care way beyond what nhi would do. this denial is a moral blind spot for our society, as our country still does not recognize health care as a human right, as do most other industrialized countries around the world.
terry holdren, ceo and general counsel for the kansas farm bureau, says that a study his organization commissioned from a kansas-based actuarial firm showed that the new policies would have little effect on premiums for traditional coverage, primarily because people most likely to buy farm bureau plans are people who would shirk pricey affordable care act policies anyway.
trump has a strategy, and his tactics serve it. running first in iowa polls, he gambled on boycotting the fox debate; he lost the caucuses, partly for that reason. even so, he looked decisive. and again, in south carolina, he inexplicably acts like he's running far behind, taking calculated risks. is he a master chess player, or has he gone too far, with blowback on the horizon?
the decision to book full flights comes as some states are grappling with a surge of new cases. early reopening plans and a lack of guidance from the white house have contributed to the spread.

other ads focus on affordability. medi-share is about half the cost of other health care programs, one of the ministry's montana radio ads said. honestly, this may be a game-changer for you and your family.
if the affordable care act comes off the books, the number of americans without coverage would skyrocket and those preexisting condition protections would vanish. and despite trump's repeated assertions, neither the white house nor congressional republicans have a plan at the ready to mitigate the damage this ruling would do to the health care system.
and the more creative the plans get, the bigger the challenge for regulators will be. many of the companies selling these plans aren't the big, commercial insurers. they are smaller operations more likely to have shaky financial reserves or engage in deceptive marketing, as a recent commonwealth fund briefing paper noted. plus these insurers sell plans through agents and brokers who might not always make sure consumers understand what they are buying.
the trump administration is considering opening up a special enrollment period for the affordable care act to help uninsured americans during the coronavirus crisis, politico and the wall street journal reported saturday.
this latest lawsuit, which comes from gop state officials and has support from president donald trump, is the third major attack on the law's constitutionality. in the past two cases, republican conservatives and allies have won key battles in the lower courts ― only to have the supreme court stymie them and leave most of the affordable care act, which is now commonly known as obamacare, standing.
those are very fair questions, and it's one of the reasons why it doesn't make any sense to spend any energy right now at the federal level. there is a logjam that's not going to get broken before 2020. let me be clear: we don't think we're going to change that underlying politics for the moment.

access to health care is especially critical in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has already taken the lives of more than 470,000 of our fellow americans and infected more than one out of every 12 additional americans, often with devastating consequences to their health, president joe biden said in a statement monday.
chip somodevilla via getty images president donald trump has asked the courts to back a lawsuit challenging the affordable care act, but the case is so weak that even conservatives are saying it should fail.
alaska is on senate democrats' radar as a reach state that could turn blue in a wave year. but party officials do not see it as a first- or second-tier priority for retaking the senate ― and are wary of turning the race into a partisan proxy war with a premature cash injection.
we are considering those updates, swensen said of vcu's changes. he noted that for the most recent fiscal year uva approved almost 10,000 applications for charity care. most of the patients who qualify pay nothing beyond a $6 copay, he said.
trump himself acknowledges the role he expects fox to play, even as he complains the network is not supportive enough. only pro trump fox shows do well, he wrote on saturday.
the kavanaugh hearing will resume at 9:30 a.m. eastern time on thursday.
trump could also throw the entire deal into disarray. he rejected an offer from senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) on friday to fund a border wall ― something democrats have said they would not accept ― in exchange for dreamer protections, according to schumer. since the shutdown, white house officials have said they would not negotiate on immigration issues.
what would we want other than that? would we want these people not to be getting insurance? of course not. they're the people who need it the most, he said. berwick had not read the blue cross blue shield association report, which the industry group shared with news organizations under an embargo in advance of its publication wednesday.
we see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms, said david bergstein, spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee. the republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.
but according to progressive caucus co-chair pramila jayapal (d-wash.), there are many democrats who personally support medicare for all and just feel it's unrealistic and politically damaging to advocate for it.
trump can, however, claim some actual successes. the 2017 tax bill eliminated the fines associated with the much-hated individual mandate that required most u.s. residents to obtain health coverage or pay a tax penalty. and a previous bill repealed the unpopular, but never actually implemented, cadillac tax on the value of the most expensive health insurance policies, as well as taxes on health care companies.
in california, dana rohrabacher, the veteran gop representative who also voted for the house repeal bill, has a new advertisement in which he talks about his daughter, who battled and survived childhood leukemia. it was devastating to my family, but we got through it and today she's doing great, rohrabacher says in the video, which includes several family members. that's why i am taking on both parties and fighting for those with pre-existing conditions.
paid leave for women also helps keep them in the workforce. and the u.s. lags other nations when it comes to the percentage of women who work outside the home.
the sanders campaign also accused harris of backtracking. it warned that her plan would leave too many americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers while driving up costs for everybody. writing on twitter, sanders campaign manager faiz shakir wrote: let's take a popular, good government-run program. add a lot more privatization and profit-seeking into it. what could go wrong?
every country that has moved to this international standard [of universal coverage] has built on the institutions that they have already, hacker said thursday. this achieves the international standard, but in a distinctly american fashion.
adopting medicare for all, medicare for america, and other schemes that would regulate hospitals would require trade-offs of one sort or another. but so would doing nothing.
new orleans, july 9 (reuters) - a federal appeals court panel grilled democratic attorneys general on tuesday about whether obamacare violates the u.s. constitution, as it weighs whether to uphold a texas judge's ruling striking down the landmark healthcare reform law.
trump at that time falsely accused obama of spying on him and supposedly wiretapping his home at trump tower in manhattan. how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. this is nixon/watergate. bad (or sick) guy! trump posted on twitter on march 4, 2017.
he then went on to acknowledge he didn't have enough support among senate democrats to pass what rank-and-file democrats want ― and that is a medicare for all, single-payer system. he predicted that support would exist sooner rather than later, and said once the majority existed, he would be prepared to end the filibuster. if not, he said, he would pass medicare for all using budget reconciliation, which requires only 50 votes, promising his vice president would overrule the senate parliamentarian if necessary to pass the bill.
meanwhile, the number of americans without health insurance has plummeted to a historic low and, this year, enrollment has actually been running slightly ahead of last year's pace.
they could also decide, separately, to introduce their own form of the individual mandate, as officials in at least some states are already talking about doing.
it appears that is not what voters want to hear, which is why republicans are trying so much misdirection now ― by misleading the public about the impact of proposals they've backed before or by simply offering up stories of family members with medical conditions, in the hopes it convinces voters that republican professions of concern are sincere.
four senators, including west virginia republican shelley moore capito, signed a letter saying they would oppose anything that rolled back expanded medicaid coverage in their states.
what's especially discouraging: where was the show of heart among the super-rich ― the heartsick recognition ― -at the prospect of 24 million souls being shoved off the insurance rolls? that image was the perfect prompt to show some of what we're not seeing among the rich these days: heart. apparently for the rich, greed and the counting-house trump all else, including the suffering of their fellow americans.
this notion that congressional intent is mysterious is the part of the lawsuit that has drawn widespread derision from legal experts, including conservative and libertarian attorneys who helped construct and argue previous challenges to the affordable care act.
but some organizations representing small businesses, including the kind that could have a role in selling ahps, are welcoming the move.
we continue to see growing demand for dynamic surveillance and behavioural analytical tools that help clients proactively manage the risk associated with the growing adoption of social media and collaboration tools. bloomberg's acquisition of netbox blue will not only enable us to meet that demand, with tools that are pro-active, preventative and predictive, but to offer businesses critical insight into where they are deriving value from these channels, said harald collet, global head of bloomberg vault.
the thing that really frightens me is the preexisting conditions, because i have multiple, said tony gordon, 25. gordon has type 1 diabetes, asthma, hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies that exacerbate the asthma, all of which require medication, supplies, doctor visits and emergency care on a regular basis. these ailments also make gordon more prone to infections. a large portion of my life is kind of dedicated to just keeping my body functional.
the obama administration is partly responsible for this: it gave state officials discretion over whether to allow the transitional plans and for how long. but iowa is among the states where officials have made maximum use of that discretion. one reason may be the political power of wellmark, the state's dominant insurer, which happens to operate the old plans.
i have the 'don't blame me i voted for bernie' sticker on my car so i'm not a centrist at all, but you have to be able to reason through the issues. people see archie as someone who will at least have the conversation, said michele horne, a 42-year-old supporter of vermont sen. bernie sanders' presidential bid who is volunteering for the campaign.
one possibility is that democrats will emerge from the 2020 elections with unified control of the federal government, for the first time since 2010, and that they will make another run at health care reform ― if not to pursue the creation of a full-fledged medicare for all system, with truly universal coverage and government control of prices, then at least to make some of the improvements they had hoped to make all along.
but it wasn't just trump's fans who were intent on serving up a big bowl of abuse to anyone who disagreed with them.

but she said in a press release, there is still too much instability and uncertainty in this market. most urgently, health plans and the consumers they serve need to know that funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies will continue uninterrupted.
chief justice john roberts and four other justices decided that this was constitutionally sound because congress has the authority to tax people, and the penalties qualified as such.
it's not an easy calculation to make, because introducing such a system would inevitably cause so many changes, some of which would push in opposite directions from others.
subjects ran from the general (fundamental tax reform) to the arcane (carryover of net operating losses). politicians delved into sensitive social issues, holding hearings on how tax reform would affect low-wage workers and the poor.
partly because of those efforts, and partly because of how the law was written, the affordable care act looks different today than its architects imagined it would. polls indicate that the program is more popular than it's ever been, thanks partly to a backlash against gop repeal efforts, but its shortcomings have also become more obvious.
on tuesday, alexis mcgill johnson, acting president of planned parenthood, said a mobile health clinic in ohio will no longer be able to operate and go into the community to provide testing for sexually transmitted infections. she also said some patients would have long wait times for care or may forgo services.
the plaintiffs in texas v. u.s. (also known as texas v. azar) are the republican attorneys general from alabama, arizona, arkansas, florida, georgia, indiana, kansas, louisiana, missouri, nebraska, north dakota, south carolina, south dakota, texas, utah and west virginia, as well as mississippi gov. phil bryant. gop officials from maine and wisconsin were part of the lawsuit until their democratic successors withdrew from the case following the 2018 elections.
insurers spent decades perfecting those techniques, and now they will have a chance to use them again, at least for one segment of the market. if you can't repeal the aca and change its insurance rules, this is the next best thing ― creating a parallel market that looks like the old one did, larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation, said tuesday, before seeing the final rule.
but president donald trump and congressional republicans have continued to undermine the aca's protections, most recently by using their tax legislation to end the individual insurance mandate. and even before the latest sabotage efforts, the landmark health care law had still left 28 million americans uninsured and millions more underinsured.
if the gop legislation were enacted this may, the number of americans without health insurance would reach 52 million in 2026, compared to 28 million if the affordable care act were left untouched, according to the report. the uninsured rate would rise from 10 percent to 19 percent over that time.
but like many of her votes against the party line, collins' support for allowing witnesses couldn't overcome opposition from nearly every other republican senator, who voted last week to block witnesses and other evidence from the trial, culminating in trump's acquittal on wednesday.
biden said obama's administration was unable to get the bill through because democrats didn't have control of congress. but in fact, the bill was alive in 2009, when democrats had majorities in both the house and senate; they lost the house the following year.

so it's likely that the president has seen the site's blaring, negative headlines about the republican health care bill. he also may have seen breitbart's broadsides amplified on major tv networks, as cnn and msnbc played the ryan recording more than a dozen times on tuesday.
as much as chaffetz clearly despises clinton, some members of the house have a different theory on why chaffetz re-endorsed trump: they think he was angling to become speaker.
he said that he ended when he called the nafta nightmare and he signed a brand new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement, the usmca. that agreement preserves, maintains most of nafta.
protections for people with pre-existing conditions are wildly popular, and obamacare itself is gaining in the polls. democrats know this and have been hammering republican candidates over and over again, especially in the reddest states on the political map. (trump won the 11 states with the highest percentage of adults with pre-existing conditions by an average of 26 percentage points; five of those states have competitive senate races in 2018.)
instructing the justice department to file a brief in favor of the challenge was an especially unusual move, given that the administration in power usually defends federal laws, even those it doesn't like. one widely respected career lawyer at the justice department actually resigned from his post over it.
the medicaid portion of the ruling turned out to be a lot more important than many people realized at the time, because states with republicans in charge largely refused to expand their programs.
not working in the sense of not meeting social goals, not in the profit sense.
hillary fans need to realize that a lot of bernie's supporters are not registered as democrats or even republicans, but as independents like bernie himself. in fact, independents are america's fastest-growing political party, and there are so many independents that they may soon outnumber both democrats and republicans combined. that's because an ever-increasing number of americans feel that neither party is truly fighting for them, represents their values, or delivers on their promises, which is probably why an embarrassing percentage of americans -- somewhere around 50 percent -- don't bother voting at all. some independents lean republican while some (like sanders, who caucuses with the democrats) lean democratic, but not enough to consistently support either party or whomever they nominate. in addition, a lot of young, first-time, and infrequent voters have no party affiliation simply because they aren't politically interested and only vote for a candidate they identify with who truly inspires them.
if you win one race in south carolina it has a massive domino effect in this state. if we pick up the 5th congressional seat, the 7th and the 1st automatically come into play, said south carolina democratic party chairman trav robertson. all it takes is one race ― whether it is a state legislative seat or whether it is a house district ― that changes, or starts to change, the psychology of the democratic party in this state, our activists, as well as the independent voters.
when former president barack obama sought to pass the affordable care act in 2009, he spent months painstakingly trying to convince moderate republican senators to support a bill. now that president donald trump is trying his own overhaul of the american health care system, such attempts at bipartisanship are nowhere to be found.
but the plan is nowhere near the full-scale replacement of the affordable care act that republicans have been promising. it has no details on costs, the size of its tax credits or how many people would be covered (or not covered).
more than 40 cases involved government workers, and the u.s. postal service had the most violations of any public-sector employer, with eight. the agency has a workforce of half a million employees, many with union protections that other workers do not enjoy ― perhaps making them more comfortable raising grievances over pumping.
a compliance related investigation can typically take weeks or months to complete. by providing automated support, this process can be reduced to a matter of hours, with compliance officers given invaluable context to support their investigation.
the obamacare opponents hope to persuade the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals in new orleans to uphold u.s. district court judge reed o'connor's ruling late last year striking down the law.
meadows has been an ally of trump since the 2016 presidential campaign. but he also drew trump's ire during the early days of the gop efforts to repeal and replace obamacare.
arizona's 8th congressional district is composed of suburbs north and west of phoenix. the district is home to a large number of retirees: more than one-fifth of residents are 65 or older.
it's also an average figure, with considerable variation from state to state, and even within individual states. under the affordable care act, anybody with household income of less than four times the poverty line ― about $100,000 a year for a family of four ― is eligible for tax credits that discount premiums. as the premiums go up, so do the tax credits, insulating these people from the effects of the increases.

if that position prevails, insurers could go back to charging higher premiums or denying coverage to people with medical problems, including everything from hay fever to multiple sclerosis. the decision could throw insurance markets into chaos, affect employer-sponsored coverage and ultimately leave millions of people without a way to pay significant medical bills.
in the years republicans controlled the house and senate during obama's and trump's presidencies, they also voted dozens of times to repeal the entire law or major components of it. republicans and conservative activists got lawsuits to dismantle the law before the supreme court twice and failed both times. this latest case could go the same way.
grayson's primary opponent, murphy, is a former republican who crossed the aisle in 2011 and now has big establishment credentials, having been endorsed by both president obama and vice president biden. but just 8 percent of murphy's campaign funds have come from small donors, less than average for senate hopefuls, while 72 percent has come from individuals giving more than $200.
there is one large problem with the obamacare death spiral theory, and that is that the recent congressional budget office analysis of the gop's replacement plan found the affordable care act is not in danger of collapse.
walsh did manage one appearance on fox business in late august, in which host stuart varney immediately began attacking him for criticizing trump, and which ended after walsh goaded varney into claiming that trump never lies.
as learnedleague is built on a foundation of player honesty, it is not possible to allow total anonymity on a player's part. in order to participate in learnedleague as a player, one must register with the league using his or her real name (first and last) and email address. ll player nomenclature policy is that, for new players, a player name will consist (at the least) of a player's last name and first initial (e.g. 'smithm'). if this is still too revealing for a player's taste, and/or if the player is famous or high-profile (e.g. 'obamam'), accommodations can be made, but only in select circumstances, and always in the spirit of league integrity.
as donald trump shifts his attention from obamacare to tax reform and infrastructure, two issues with the potential for bipartisan compromise, democrats reiterated this week that they are willing to make a deal. but only, they said, if the trump infrastructure proposal includes real federal spending needed to overhaul the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, and waterways.
five-to-one's been a standard part of the process and what it was several years ago, he said. no, five-to-one doesn't concern me at all.
and because republicans are arguing in a counterfactual world, where claims that their bill would have protected people with pre-existing conditions are tested by partisan health care wonks instead of the experiences of the people affected, they confidently make false claims.
perhaps collins is worried about a primary challenge from the right in 2020. i would be.
that standard could be difficult for both chambers to agree on, particularly if house conservatives draw a hard line on cutting regulations that would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

more often than not, though, the candidates weren't making misstatements so much as they were simply talking past each other, ignoring questions or criticism to make their own points. and even then, their statements were so opaque and jargon-laden that they were nearly impossible to follow.
of course, even a newly elected president sanders would have a hard time passing medicare for all, given that democrats would be lucky to have a bare majority in the senate and already several more conservative members have said they oppose the idea.
the bill passed the house, 217 to 213, with all democrats and 20 republicans voting against it, and is now in the senate's hands.

if there are not meaningful protections for consumer freedom that will lower premiums, then the bill will not go forward, cruz said.
as the urban institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using medicaid or the costs of covid-19 treatments. the centers for medicare and medicaid services projected last year that medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. by contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.

what form that might take is unclear, she says, perhaps electoral, perhaps a surge in funding for networks to help women pay for the procedure and the travel from state to state, perhaps a robust black market for medication. but what is certain, she and others say, is that just as roe did not end the abortion fight, the overturning of it will not end abortion.
this is a moral issue. the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all americans. we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. i want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.

after a moment's reflection, it felt like the most natural thing in the world to reply. already we have a thing, i texted, feeling my heart soften. and i like how we're able to talk through it.
hillary supporters don't have any animosity towards bernie because bernie is a true progressive who is to the left of hillary on nearly every issue, with the notable exception of gun control. hillary fans, like a majority of americans, probably want universal single-payer healthcare, but they've been told by hillary that it can't be done, along with the lie that fighting for it would somehow lead to the destruction of obamacare, even though medicare for all would be an expansion of one of obamacare's key elements. they probably share bernie's desire for a $15 minimum wage (hillary will only ask for $12), more paid family leave, more vacation time, guaranteed sick leave, free college tuition, and a ban on fracking.
stephen colbert has delivered lots of good lines on the gop's effort to destroy obamacare, but the joke he fired off wednesday on the late show rates special mention.
roberts, a nominee of former president george w. bush, has come to be seen as the supreme court's key swing vote since justice anthony kennedy's retirement in 2018.
their goal is to create a health care system in which government does a lot less to help people get medical coverage and in which insurers can operate without so much regulation. the republicans have made significant headway, and now they are on the verge of making more, although how much more depends in part on how hard the law's defenders fight back.
in 2012, the plaintiffs argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because it commanded people to get insurance, something congress did not have the power to do. roberts and liberal judges rejected that argument, saying a fair reading of the statute recognized the mandate not as a command, but a choice. people could get insurance or they could pay a fee, the court argued, and paying a fee is a perfectly valid exercise of the government's right to levy taxes.
when moderator chris wallace asked trump whether, after four years of promises, he had a plan to provide universal coverage, he did not answer. instead, he lied about protecting people with pre-existing conditions, when in fact he urged the passage of republican bills in congress that would have allowed insurers in some states to charge people more based on their medical history. and trump's department of justice has written a brief supporting yet another conservative lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the entire aca, including its safeguards for people with pre-existing conditions.
it's a lot about the individual, not the party, he said of union members' voting decisions. they know sen. donnelly's record on trade issues, on working-families issues.
what accounts for this rejection of democracy itself? peter beinart argues in the atlantic that trump has upended the very meaning of corruption. for trump's followers, the prospect that he has violated the law, ethical norms or even his oath of office no longer counts. instead, corruption is the imagined degradation of white america by immigrants and minorities who, they believe, are upending the social hierarchy.
in terms of genuine principal, the gop has become a squalid void. what pseudo-policies it has serve a few powerful constituencies with their own narrow priorities: a base filled with racial anxiety; evangelicals bent on repealing same-sex marriage and roe v. wade; donors hungry for tax cuts and deregulation; a callous gun lobby that helps perpetuate mass slaughter. nothing else matters, save avoiding the truth about trump and russia by whatever means required.
the activists are focusing on an issue they think can bring idahoans together: skirting their gop-led legislature to make idaho the next state to adopt obamacare's medicaid expansion.
the proponents of this approach are sanders and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), although she has said she would move first to create a transitional plan and then ask congress for a full-blown version of medicare for all two years after taking office.
nixon might have burned the tapes if he knew fox news would have backed his action, presidential historian douglas brinkley said.
by employers' cutbacks. there has been a large cost shift from employers to employees in employer-sponsored health insurance as employees find themselves with higher deductibles, higher coinsurance, and a higher share of premiums. (5)
it's just an opportunity to stick his finger in obama's eye, the adviser said. this is something that just landed in his lap and they're going to have fun with it.
the site could end up being offline for far less than the scheduled downtime, a cms spokesperson told the hill. the actual downtime last year was 21.5 hours and there were 53.5 hours of maintenance downtime on sunday mornings at the end of 2016, under the obama administration, the cms spokesperson said.
in september, trump also announced a plan to send medicare beneficiaries a $200 card to spend on prescription drugs with out-of-pocket costs. the cards have yet to be distributed because the administration is still working out logistics, such as how to cover the $7 billion price tag.

you just can't pretend that this is working well. i think it's time to talk about the fact that the emperor has no clothes. —rep. jared huffman (d-calif.)
the catch is that the tax credits are scaled to income that falls below four times the poverty line, which is about $49,000 for an individual and $100,000 for a family of four. for people who make more than that, insurance can be frighteningly expensive, to the point where many don't get coverage at all.
democrats are preparing to make senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a central villain of their push to win total control of congress in 2020, an effort top advisers to the kentucky republican say will only further his efforts to become a conservative hero.
biden opened his speech with a quote from civil rights activist ella baker; warren spoke in front of blocks arranged to read b-l-m; harris declared there is no vaccine for racism. the democratic party has relied on black voters for decades, but the 2020 convention likely featured more frank talk about racism and racial divides than any other convention.
it includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. in the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall ― but the proper wall never got built. i'll get it built.

instead, beshear has focused primarily on health care and public education, and he has directly attached himself to the teacher movement. last spring, he sued to block the pension law that sparked the teacher protests and won ― the state supreme court tossed out the law in december. during the primary, he tapped jacqueline coleman, a high school assistant principal who participated in the protests, as his running mate. in an interview with huffpost, beshear called bevin the greatest threat to public education we have ever seen in this state and declared that the very future of whether or not there is going to be funding for our public schools is on the line tuesday.
radically transforms medicaid. funding for the entire medicaid program, including for people who were on the program before the health care law took effect, would change dramatically. today, the federal government offers an open-ended promise: states receive however much money it takes to guarantee comprehensive benefits for anybody who becomes eligible. under the new legislation, states would get a lump sum per person, based on a pre-determined formula. critics have warned that formula would not keep up with medical costs, forcing states to make deep cuts over time, either to who is eligible for coverage, what benefits they receive or how much medical providers are paid to treat these patients.
at the same time, national health care spending growth slowed to an unprecedented rate. that may have been related to the aca, but even if it wasn't, it occurred during a time when an increasing number of americans had health coverage and received medical care.
simple minded people can't handle too much information. you lose them with facts. it's no secret that a large part of donald trump's base constitutes of less educated and less wealthy demographic. in fact, according to the atlantic, most of trump's supporters don't have a college degree.
if the penalty is $0, then it can't be a tax, these republican officials argue. and if the mandate isn't a tax anymore, then the mandate is an unconstitutional command to purchase insurance. and if the mandate is unconstitutional, they say, the rest of the law is, too, because the features of the affordable care act are so intertwined. congress, they say, did not intend for the rest of the program to operate without this essential piece.
minnesota currently has the fewest people with disabilities living in institutions
since taking office, trump has continued to call obama's presidency a failure, even as he has taken credit for his accomplishments. trump has repeatedly claimed that he got the va choice act passed into law to give veterans the ability to see a private doctor if wait times at va clinics grew too long. in fact, obama signed that into law in 2014. more broadly, trump had called the economy during his term the best in history, even though obama oversaw the creation of 1.5 million more jobs in his last three years than trump had in his first three and the gdp growth rates have been roughly the same.
the rules protecting people with preexisting conditions will always stay, he added.
that's because insurance depends on premiums from healthy people to underwrite the medical bills of the small minority with serious health problems. and people in relatively good health are precisely the types to postpone enrolling until the very last minute.

before the session ended, new mexico gov. michelle lujan grisham (d) ordered the withdrawal of most of the 118 national guard troops at the state's southern border, sending a bold message to the white house moments before president donald trump's state of the union address.
trump said last week that republicans will have a new health care plan to replace the affordable care act, a signature of the obama administration. his boast came after the justice department announced its backing of a lawsuit that would throw out the aca — a more extreme step beyond previous moves to eliminate parts of the law.
the top item on pelosi's agenda is beefing up the financial assistance available to low- and middle-income households who get their health coverage through the affordable care act's health insurance exchanges. the law provides tax credits to defray insurance premiums for people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $49,000 a year for a single person and $100,000 for a family of four.
republican leaders had good reason to be cautious about shutting down the government: the gop would probably get blamed for it. historically, the public tends to hold the republican party for such impasses.

all this is central to the rigid orthodoxy that republican presidents and legislators will be forced to follow, now and in the future. mitt romney did; marco rubio has; paul ryan will. no matter how personally attractive, no candidate will change this party until forces outside the party make dramatic change imperative.
ryan's assault on government programs fared rather differently.
mccain asked inslee if he would support the plan even though a it would cost $93 trillion or, to every person in this room, $600,000 for each of your households.
senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) also lambasted the order, noting protections for preexisting conditions are the law.
one short-term plan now available in california, for example, limits hiv coverage to just $10,000, according to researchers from georgetown's center for health insurance reforms. treatment for hiv can exceed that amount in just two months.
remember when we had good news? that was nice.
according to lake, mainers also don't like that kavanaugh has signaled that a sitting president may not be indicted. collins is perceived to be very honest, very clean, and mainers are very anti-corruption, lake said. so this idea of kavanaugh letting trump get away with things ― that's not going to sell well in maine. mainers like checks and balances, and that's a really strong argument against kavanaugh.
the white house statement lays out the high public cost of treating people without insurance, though it does not distinguish between immigrants and the nearly 30 million americans who have no health insurance or have inadequate coverage.
but after beshear won on tuesday, seemingly everyone reserved praise for the teachers. beshear thanked them in his victory speech, and multiple democratic officials used the same descriptor to describe their impact on the race.
but that could change in november. democratic gubernatorial candidates have a real shot of replacing republicans in florida, georgia, michigan and wisconsin. georgia is particularly interesting because it is one of the states that elect insurance commissioners directly and a democrat could take that seat, too.
she has not been a frontline fighter, hogue said, but she has been a bulwark against the impact of an extraordinary agenda to oppress women through reproductive rights, and she has been there when we needed her for planned parenthood, and she said protecting roe was something she understood to be a fundamental responsibility, and that is what we need right now — someone who recognizes the sanctity of that contract. there are a handful of people here who own the fate and the future of all american women.
i'm not ducking. i just can't answer it, cassidy said. i don't know.
republican opponents call the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets, while supporters say striking it down would threaten the healthcare of 20 million people who have gained insurance since its enactment.
and then there would be effects that have nothing to do with health insurance. the law is the reason that restaurant chains must post calorie counts on their menus, for example. it modified the indian health service and changed the approval process for so-called biosimilar drugs.
as those two senators know well, and as mccaskill pointed out on thursday, democrats went about writing health legislation very differently eight years ago.
refundable tax credits: the released bill contains the same tax credits as the february 10 draft; however, it also includes a phase out of the credit for individuals earning over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers). this would reduce the value of the credit by 10% of the amount by which an individual's income exceeds the income threshold.

slavitt's critics saw the new nonprofit organization as, at best, yet another naive attempt at transcending partisan politics and, at worst, a corporate-backed trojan horse designed to suck the air out of the nascent movement for single-payer health care. it certainly didn't help matters that the group's founding council included insurance and hospital executives, former republican lawmakers and veteran conservative policy experts.

but there are other ways to help struggling consumers. at the state level, officials can tap into federal funds ― with a relatively modest state investment ― in order to create create so-called reinsurance pools, which reduce premiums by offsetting the cost of expensive beneficiaries.
take a look back at the george w. bush administration. condoleezza rice was the first woman to ever hold the position of national security advisor and is the first black woman to be secretary of state. are these impressive achievements celebrated by women, black people, or those who support diversity? alberto gonzales is not only the first mexican american to ever be the us attorney general, but is currently the highest-ranking latino american to ever hold a position in the executive branch. do any latinos celebrate him with pride as a trailblazer? last i heard, gonzales was having trouble finding a job.
in august 2018, trump signed the $717 billion defense measure, officially titled the john s. mccain national defense authorization act, but neglected to mention the senator at all at the signing ceremony, instead boasting about a new military branch he wanted to create dubbed the space force. (former secretary of state john kerry, another vietnam war vet, called the scene disgraceful.) trump did reference mccain later that day ― but only to insult him.

but michigan's market isn't melting down. far from it. with open enrollment for 2017 underway, consumers shopping for coverage on healthcare.gov will find an array of plans, many of them relatively cheap even before subsidies kick in. meanwhile, the number of michiganders without coverage has plummeted to a historic low.
after house leaders delayed the vote, the congressional budget office released a fresh analysis of the bill, which had already been revised once.
already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
that last part is certainly true. the affordable care act's new rules for insurers made insurance a lot more expensive. and although the law also created a system of tax credits to offset those higher prices, people with incomes higher than four times the poverty line ― about $49,000 for an individual, $100,000 for a family of four ― don't receive those subsidies.
tracy said it would be more accurate to say he had gotten nicely angry ― although, he allowed, he might have cursed once or twice.

at medi-share, gardner said, the ministry goes to great lengths to ensure that prospective members understand that medi-share is not insurance. the guidelines spell out the limits, and members must indicate with a separate signature that they understand those limits. but experts and consumer advocates worry that people who sign up for ministries may not realize the implications of those limits until it's too late.
during a roundtable discussion with other lawyers in 1999, however, kavanaugh said, maybe nixon was wrongly decided ― heresy though it is to say so. at the time, kavanaugh said the opinion took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official.
but that center has disappeared. political scientists have noted congress hasn't been this polarized since the end of reconstruction in the 1870s. according to the pew research center, in 1973–1974, the first two years of biden's time in the senate, 240 members of the house ― a majority ― were ideologically in between the most liberal republican and the most conservative democrat. in the senate, 29 senators fell within the same ideological range. but by 2011–2012, no democrat was more conservative than any republican in either chamber, and no republican was more liberal than any democrat.
modern supreme court nominees almost never publicly discuss their opinions about specific cases. liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg helped set the unwritten rule by declining to answer questions about her views on certain cases during her 1993 confirmation hearing because that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process. neil gorsuch, trump's first supreme court nominee, took the norm to new levels during his confirmation hearing, refusing to share his views on even the most widely accepted landmark cases, like brown v. board of education.
the court rejected two previous challenges to the affordable care act, but in both cases it was chief justice john roberts joining the four liberals. saving the law now would require at least one more conservative to join him, and the potential vote of barrett, who criticized earlier decisions upholding the law, is hard to predict. trump appointed barrett, well aware of her record, and said just last week that he hopes the court rules against the affordable care act this time.

mcgrath, who supports an obamacare expansion to include a public option, legislation to lower the price of prescription drugs and federal infrastructure investments, particularly in kentucky's rural areas, came out late in the race to back existing senate legislation to reform police. she also touted her democratic bona fides in a late advertising push.
even though i will not be in my hometown of detroit on thursday, i remain deeply committed to my home nation, america, carson's statement said. i do not see a political path forward in light of last evening's super tuesday primary results. however, this grassroots movement on behalf of 'we the people' will continue. along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for president, i remain committed to saving america for future generations. we must not depart from our goals to restore what god and our founders intended for this exceptional nation.
critics, on the other hand, say that transferring spending power to states could skirt protections that federal law provides for vulnerable older people.
the single biggest difference in the two landscapes: nixon's impeachment took place before ailes could act on a 1970 memo titled a plan for putting the gop on tv news, while trump's happened decades after ailes' 1996 creation had become the most-watched channel on cable.

of the 50 senate seats democrats hold in 2020, this one was won by the thinnest margin. democratic sen. maggie hassan defeated gop incumbent kelly ayotte by a mere 1,107 votes ― equivalent to roughly one-tenth of 1 percent of the roughly 739,000 votes cast.
medicaid reforms: the bill shifts medicaid to a per capita model, with a base year of fy2016 in most cases, or fy2019 if a state expands its medicaid population after fy2016. the per capita payments would be inflated annually in line with the medical care component of the cpi, which is significantly higher than the general cpi plus population indexing that has been used for medicaid block grants in house gop budgets. the bill also makes changes to allow states to disenroll high-dollar lottery winners from medicaid.
democrats are in right races in montana up and down the ballot.
proponents of medicare for all know this. they argue that the public plan would be simpler, more comprehensive and ultimately less costly for most americans.
on wednesday, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) announced plans to introduce an amendment to a disaster aid funding bill that would prohibit the justice department from using any more funds to litigate that lawsuit seeking to strike down the entirety of obamacare ― the one where the department is essentially siding with the plaintiffs. schumer's goal, in the unlikely event that a vote on his amendment is granted by mcconnell, is to get gop senators on the record about where they stand on the lawsuit.
biden, harris, and other democrats who are fearful that this disruption would anger the public — and who are also more accepting of the profit-seeking nature of the health care industry — have introduced policies that would leave most of the system untouched, while also creating a public option health care plan that would compete with private insurers.
other democrats have proposed an expanded government role in providing health coverage and medical care through means such as a public option plan that would compete with private health insurance or proposals to allow consumers to buy into medicare or medicaid.
democrats are already going on the offense, believing that the administration's position on the lawsuit will matter far more to voters in 2020 than anything coming out of special counsel robert mueller's investigation into the 2016 presidential election.
roughly three-quarters of trump voters said they believed that most of or almost all congressional republicans support trump. that represented a marked strengthening of trump's political situation compared to three years ago.

washington ― the senate reached a deal monday to fund the government and potentially provide a path forward for a larger immigration agreement. the house passed the deal later on monday, and president donald trump signed the bill that same evening, effectively ending the shutdown.
during his questioning, sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) suggested that judiciary chairman chuck grassley (r-iowa) has deemed some documents committee confidential that show that kavanaugh received copies of emails stolen from leahy in 2002 relating to democrats' strategy for processing then-president george w. bush's judicial nominees. kavanaugh testified in 2004 and 2006 that he didn't know those emails had been stolen, so evidence suggesting otherwise would mean he committed perjury. but since grassley has restricted access to those documents to committee members, leahy wasn't able to ask kavanaugh specifically about them in his hearing.
but trump hasn't just fallen short on his fix-it vows to reverse poverty and violence at home and war and destruction abroad, as he put it in his 2016 republican national convention acceptance speech. mexico hasn't paid for trump's proposed wall on the southern border, for example. in fact, few new sections of border wall have actually been built. his administration diverted funding from planned military projects for construction of the wall, which is mired in legal challenges.
in an interview with a local radio host on tuesday, ward linked mcsally to mccain and flake ― both frequent trump critics. she also said attack ads from groups supporting mcsally showed that her campaign was surging.
when the coronavirus economy cost kevin lewis, 58, his job as a teacher and youth basketball coach, it also meant the loss of the health insurance that covered his family. his wife, veronica daniels-lewis, had to figure out some way to continue her treatments for multiple sclerosis.
this is not a battle of ideas; it's an investment in cynicism. and it's hard to avoid a few ugly conclusions. clinton has not learned from the mistakes of 2008. she does not understand the democratic party's base. she does not respect the activists and intellectuals who have fought to establish the party's economic policy agenda over the past 50 years. and she thinks voters in early primary states are dumb enough to fall for obvious dishonesty, just because they already like her.
how should government finance the program?
a recent npr report noted that nonprofit mary washington healthcare, in fredericksburg, va., had 300 cases in court in one month. (following that report the hospital announced that it would suspend the practice of suing patients for unpaid bills.)
the legislature is looking at several proposals, all of which would create new options for residents of kansas. the most controversial, and potentially most consequential, is a bill that would allow the kansas farm bureau to sell health benefits coverage that would not, by law, count as a form of insurance.
that allotment would grow more slowly than projected medicaid costs. this would force states to come up with additional money, reduce what they pay medical providers or cut either people or benefits from the program, according to the cbo. medicaid enrollment would shrink by 17 percent, or 14 million people, by 2026 compared to what it would be under current law.

even these groups would concede that many people buying coverage now are desperate for less costly alternatives. the question is how to help them.
mcgrath emerged as a prominent and promising new face in kentucky politics during that earlier democratic primary. her long-shot bid for a house seat focused heavily on her experience in the marines and her status as an outsider.
and, gaffigan said, trump supporters were all about trump.
trump's vaunted dealmaking skills have failed him so far, however. he didn't pick up any new support by offering to eliminate essential health benefits from the bill, but instead lost a wave of moderates and made the measure more politically toxic than it had been.
sadly, the missives began to feel mind-numbingly similar — hey — and once again i found i couldn't bear to read how another man in his 40s lived for the weekends and couldn't wait to retire. besides, my health had moved front and center on the priority list.
that was a refrain huffpost heard from many democrats and strategists, underscoring how large of a gift trump's budget proposal is.
it's why trump can't stop talking about... he adds, followed by the sound of trump repeatedly saying biden's name.
after sotomayor's effort at correcting roberts on the facts, the chief justice seemed to want more clarification from verrili. is that true with every policy sold on the exchanges? he asked.
therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods ― and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us ― i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs.
it's not just texas: nearly a hundred rural hospitals in the united states have closed since 2010, according to the center for health services research at university of north carolina at chapel hill. another 600-plus rural hospitals are at risk of closing, according to an oft-cited 2016 report by ivantage health analytics.

and as we moved beyond that july 2004 speech, to obama getting elected to the u.s. senate and bush. getting re-elected to the presidency, to the human tragedy of hurricane katrina, to the various wars in various places, to the nasty rifts that continued among americans, to a persistent and loud rumor that obama would indeed run for president. you could almost feel the desperation in the air for that to happen, for him to save us.
the affordable care act sets a spending target for medicare, as part of a broader effort by the law's architects to reduce the cost of medical care. ipab's job is to make those targets stick, by recommending cuts if medicare costs exceed the threshold.
you want the honest answer? she said. somebody had class at that time… that was certainly part of it. i actually skipped immigration law to go and testify.
we've seen this before, time and time again. in 2015, he declared he would replace the affordable care act with something terrific. that was about as specific as he ever got. last year, trump announced on twitter that republicans would become the party of healthcare! and pass a big bill. then he took it back. those two examples bookend innumerable vows in between.
(ap photo/bob daugherty) lawmakers watch president ronald reagan sign into law the 1986 tax reform act on the white house south lawn on oct. 22, 1986. from left, are: senate majority leader robert dole of kansas, rep. raymond mcgrath, r-n.y.; rep. dan rostenkowski, d-ill., rep. frank guerini, d-n.j.; sen. russell long, d-la.; rep. william coyne, d-pa., and rep. john duncan, r-tenn.
overwhelmingly, nevada voters are supportive of the specific components of the aca, with as many as 9-in-10 saying that any replacement should not turn back the clock on coverage and put insurance companies in charge again, the analysis accompanying the polling data says.
some people would clearly feel better off. young people, for instance, could buy cheaper insurance ― particularly if they were willing to get less comprehensive coverage than the law currently requires.
but last year, north carolina underwent a court-ordered redistricting that pushed buncombe county, home to the liberal city of asheville, within the 11th district's boundaries — an attempt to course-correct for republican gerrymandering.
democratic spending on health care ads is slightly up from where it was in the past three election cycles during the same period. and democratic strategists and candidates say that for them, health care will be front and center.
but i will not be deterred from ending the corporate greed that creates dysfunction in our health care system. we must pass medicare for all. — bernie sanders (@berniesanders) july 15, 2019
the change is not as dramatic as it sounds. california opened up its version of medicaid, known as medi-cal, to younger low-income undocumented residents back in 2016. the new agreement merely raises the cutoff age from 18 to 26. estimates suggest about 90,000 people will sign up for the program as a result.
most of us have been registered democrats forever but just so we could vote in the primaries. since trump, we all see the need to get involved with the goal of trying to move the dems toward more progressive positions, he said.
i'd like to think so, too, hirono interjected. but you cannot escape the conclusion that the people you used to work for before, the koch brothers, that this one was one of their biggest issues that they wanted to have done away with ― prosecutions under the migratory species treaty.
over two years after maine residents voted to legalize recreational marijuana, mills signed a bill to regulate and legalize the sale of recreational marijuana on thursday. the law outlines the rules for growing, buying and selling marijuana and how to apply for a license. state officials expect legal weed to arrive in stores by early 2020 and anticipate the state will pull in $22 million in sales during the first three months.

despite all of that, barrett could still rule to uphold the affordable care act this time around. she could, for example, reject the new lawsuit simply on the grounds that a mandate with no penalty attached isn't a command at all ― and, as a result, not a constitutional problem.
and democrats in congress won't be the only ones talking about medicare for all over the next two years.
some of the swing voters trump needed to win apparently took notice. a lower percentage of voters viewed him as conservative than any of his immediate republican predecessors in the white house.
but any kind of ruling against the affordable care act would likely send the issue to the supreme court, which, in turn, would probably hand down a decision sometime near the end of its term ― in other words, late spring or early summer 2020, just months before the presidential election.
i think this issue is not a new one for any of us, sen. john thune (r-s.d.), the no. 2 gop senator, told reporters on tuesday. i think the administration is still looking to get us to force action up here to give us an opportunity to actually come up with a solution that would be better than what people are dealing with today.
at last week's hearing, rep. patrick mchenry (r-n.c.) tried to derail porter's exchange with dimon by interrupting her with a parliamentary inquiry about the whiteboard that porter was writing numbers on. members customarily vet any visual aids with the committee 24 hours in advance of a public hearing, and porter had not. that gave mchenry an opening.
but democrats cathy myers, a teacher, and randy bryce, an ironworker, are competing to flip the seat. they hold similar positions on the issues, though bryce has positioned himself as the more progressive of the two.
at the same time, republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the types of insurance available. these efforts may result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health ― and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions. while republicans may not want to talk about health care all that much this cycle, president donald trump's administration recently handed democrats a political gift and put the issue back in the forefront. last month, the justice department threw its support behind a lawsuit arguing that obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions ― some of the most popular parts of the law ― are unconstitutional. democrats immediately began using the lawsuit in campaign ads and fundraising emails, and they plan to press trump's supreme court pick on the matter as well.
for now, progressives look interested in playing the long game, knowing that none of the bills they really want to pass will become law with trump in the white house and republicans controlling the senate. progressives seem to have taken the view that even voting on their dream legislation would do more to divide democrats than to advance their cause.
for most americans, assessments of trump lined up with prior political convictions: republican voters thought he was doing well, democratic voters didn't. it is still very much a red america and a blue america, maybe more than at any time in modern history.
similarly, it is fair to assume that a candidate like sanders, who not only wrote the damn bill but has also made medicare for all the main focus of his agenda for most of his career, would pursue comprehensive health care reform more aggressively and seriously than a candidate like biden, who in early 2009 was among those members of the obama administration urging the president to delay a push on health care in order to focus more on the economy.
national republican groups have responded in force, hoping to avoid another embarrassing defeat in solid-red territory. three groups ― the republican national committee, the national republican congressional committee and the congressional leadership fund super pac ― have together spent nearly $1 million boosting lesko's bid.
we will stay united, from sanders and warren to manchin and warner and with our unity we will bring bold and dramatic change to our country, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said in his speech at the start of the night, promising unity among senate democrats. we will make health care affordable for all.
peters, a moderate democrat in the senate, has always emphasized his record of bipartisanship. he authored six bills signed into law under trump, including expanding training programs for small businesses and apprenticeships for veterans. his vision for washington is to get back to a place where democrats and republicans can write big legislation together.
carlos barria / reuters president donald trump announces judge amy coney barrett to fill the supreme court seat left vacant by the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg, at the white house, sept. 26.
while democrats have fiercely opposed the conservative jurist's nomination, trump's fellow republicans hold a 53-47 senate majority and her confirmation to a lifetime post on the court seems assured.
julie buckholt gets this treatment weekly. megan buckholt, 25, and rachael gonzalez, 28, need it less often but still rely on it to stay alive.
but don't necessarily count on the republicans whose districts make out on the deal to preserve it. the medicaid expansion is not sustainable, comer said. nearly 10 percent of the people in his district are covered by the program.

the states took the same position as the administration.
but before the pandemic, arguably the defining policy episode of his tenure was his effort to repeal the affordable care act ― an effort that occupied much of his first year in office, ultimately failed, and sent his approval rating tumbling down.
judiciary chairman chuck grassley and his likely successor, sen. lindsey graham, have apparently acquiesced to the possibility of removing attorney general jeff sessions shortly after the election, a move they both once opposed. this, of course, would allow trump to appoint a temporary or permanent replacement who could stifle, defund or destroy the special counsel investigation into trump's role in the russian attack on our democracy.
for decades, mcconnell poured federal money into the paducah gaseous diffusion plant, a cold war-era nuclear power relic that had become technologically obsolete by the 1980s. mcconnell's maneuvering kept it open, preserving a source of well-paid union jobs in southwestern kentucky. when the workers came down with severe health problems from toxic exposures at the plant, mcconnell responded by giving them free government health care. this isn't a secret in kentucky. he brags about it in campaign ads every election season.
the issue of maternity benefits began to get a lot of attention on wednesday night, as word spread of a deal that the white house and gop leaders were making with conservative house republicans, in a desperate effort to rally the votes they need to win approval there for the american health care act.
but trump failed to note those with preexisting conditions are already covered by u.s. law.
the dccc's announcement follows other signs that democrats are benefiting from high enthusiasm within their base in the wake of trump's election. actblue, the website that processes donations to democratic candidates and causes, reported last week that it had processed more than $111 million in online donations in the first quarter of the year. the figure is four times the total haul in the first quarter of 2015, the last non-election year.
the gop saw potential in james after he lost to sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.) in 2018 by 6 percentage points in his first political campaign. he came out of that race without a negative ad run against him and finished closer to stabenow than most anticipated.
our town is hopping with resistance. i know, it's massachusetts, but it's still extraordinary to see the number of young parents and those new to protest and to politics, she added. believe me, i haven't seen this before.
we knew it was not perfect, that it had some problems, reid said of the affordable care act. if democrats get control of the government, he said he hopes they can start by undoing the damage trump has done to the health care system and then add a public option.
a: some have been more specific than others. warren provided a detailed financing plan for her proposal, though some experts have questioned whether its assumptions are realistic. sanders has full legislation that outlines some funding options but doesn't commit to any.
his first foray into washington leadership came in the 1998 electoral cycle, when he chaired the national republican senatorial committee. it was a promising year for the gop. democrats were defending a host of vulnerable red-state senate seats ― arkansas, nevada, ohio and the carolinas were all in play ― and republicans thought they had strong odds in wisconsin, washington and california. mcconnell raised over $37 million in soft money — a record at the time — and blew it. the republicans didn't add a single seat to their majority. in mcconnell's second election on the job, they lost five seats to democrats and then ceded their majority in may 2001 when vermont sen. jim jeffords left the gop and began caucusing with the democrats.
the formula initially made the child sick, forcing the mother to buy a special version for sensitive babies. she was eligible for financial assistance for formula under nevada's women, infants and children program for low-income families ― but she was told she needed to turn in the free electric pump she had received through the same public program. (a wic spokesperson says that a mother would be asked to return a breast pump she's no longer using, but that benefits could not be withheld if she didn't.)
responding to a comment from sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) about not wanting to go back to a time when abortion is outlawed, kavanaugh said, i don't live in a bubble. i live in the real world.
trump's budget triples down on republicans' constant attacks on health care and puts every republican in a god-awful spot. you think rodney davis, scott perry, or don bacon wants to answer for this shit? the strategist said, mentioning three vulnerable incumbent republicans.
there's also some smaller things in the trump plan, like allowing prescription drugs to be reimported to the united states from countries like canada, where their cost is lower, and requiring medical providers to disclose their prices. curiously, there's no mention of trump's ballyhooed (and quite exaggerated) proposal to permit medicare to directly negotiate drug prices.
the ad is part of an advocacy campaign aarp launched feb. 15 to specifically combat a rise in the age rating, which it is calling an age tax. at the time, the organization encouraged its members to call those in congress who were active in drafting the health care legislation to oppose the rating provision.
on income taxes, we've brought rates on the top couple of percent back to where they were in the 1990s (where they were after being raised in 1990 and 1993), while locking in the income tax rate cuts for those below that level put in place by george w. bush. in 1989, the top income tax rate was 28 percent. starting january 1, 2013, it stood at 39.6 percent.
as politico's paul demko first reported on thursday evening, the department of health and human services has cancelled a final burst of television and radio advertising designed to encourage people to sign up for obamacare insurance plans.
the end result is that hundreds of thousands of people, primarily in rural counties, will be left without any insurance options and thus no access to affordable health care.
mike braun in indiana, martha mcsally in arizona, patrick morrisey in west virginia, rick scott in florida ― the list goes on. all across the country, republicans running for congress are promising voters they will look out for people with pre-existing conditions while supporting some combination of legislation, litigation and regulation that would undermine those very protections.
ironically, cost was a main reason rice had postponed investigating her symptoms before then, despite suspecting something serious was wrong. the possibility of joining crawford's employer-sponsored plan seemed to come along at just the right time. in the meantime, rice met with a urologist, who encouraged her to wait on treatment until she had health insurance.
mekelburg told tina galasso, a now-former friend, that she'd gotten to know cortez before the murder and spent a lot of time with him. mekelburg and siino created a nonprofit organization dedicated to overturning cortez's conviction. she was the president. siino was the moneyman. according to 2007 tax records, siino donated more than $56,000 to hire jeffrey lichtman, a criminal defense attorney best known for keeping mobster john junior gotti out of prison. lichtman was unable to win a new trial for cortez.
tellingly, moore cited a version of this report in the very same 2015 column in which he made the deficit claim ― and a bunch of other arguments about the health care law that didn't hold up to scrutiny. after going through the article, line by line, new york magazine columnist jonathan chait concluded, there is not a single substantive claim in this column that appears to be true.
the alleged constitutional flaw in the affordable care act exists because trump signed a republican bill in 2017 that zeroed out the financial penalty for people who didn't sign up for insurance.
but collins forcefully denied the charge, which she called tremendously sexist. in an interview earlier this week, she said she felt no pressure from mcconnell.
the affordable care act came along at just the right time for sheila tyson, who faced insurmountable medical bills after she got a liver transplant in 2013. she was too sick to work, so she lost her job and the insurance that went with it, and she couldn't afford to pay for her own policy. obamacare subsidies changed that.
the maverick senator, who ran on the gop ticket for president against barack obama in 2008, has been one of the few republicans to speak out against donald trump. during his campaign, trump took shots at mccain for being captured in north vietnam and held as a prisoner of war for five years. he's not a war hero, said trump. he was a war hero because he was captured. i like people who weren't captured. trump received four student deferments from military service between 1964 and 1968.
the contrast with tuesday night's confident, clear presentations by sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) was conspicuous. and while that might be good news for sanders and warren, it's probably not good for democrats overall ― or for the tens of millions of americans still struggling with the cost of health care.
the trump administration has floated the idea of using a foreign price index to determine what medicare pays for some drugs, while negotiating with house democrats over a possible compromise — although the chances of a deal, let alone a promising one, seem slim.
washington ― with conservatives unable to find a deal and leadership unable to find the votes, house republicans pulled their health care bill from the floor and delayed a vote that had been scheduled for thursday.
but, he continued, every district and every state is different, and everybody at the table's got a different perspective in terms of what their current opponent looks like.
about 61% of republican and republican-leaning independent voters said that they would be more likely to support trump over congressional republicans if they had a disagreement; only 13% said they would side with the party members.
tens of millions of americans remain uninsured or under-insured, facing large out-of-pocket costs, which among other things deter people from getting the health care they need. that's a scary prospect at any time, but it's especially scary when a once-in-a-generation pandemic is sweeping across the country.
instead, many of those low-income residents remain uninsured or underinsured in plans with high deductibles and copayments.
biden and harris argued early on over their respective plans to overhaul health care, with harris defending her more moderate version of medicare fo -all and biden arguing her plan was too disruptive and could alienate voters who would lose their private health insurance coverage.
asked about the language in the bill that would allow insurers to charge their oldest customers five times what they charge younger ones, sen. james lankford (r-okla.) said he's fine with it.
as even conservative legal experts have pointed out, the claim doesn't make sense given that congress in 2017 understood it was leaving the affordable care act in place when it decided to reduce the penalty to zero. it did so anyway.
three years later, roberts and five other justices sided with the obama administration again in another attempt to damage the affordable care act by eliminating insurance subsidies for more than half the country.
except, of course, their rising anger, stoked by yet more empty and diversionary anti-washington rhetoric that only deepened their sense of impotence. focused on the donor class, party leaders charged the democrats with class warfare against the less than embattled rich, while still failing to acknowledge through substantive policies the very real struggles of its rank-and-file. the election in 2014 of yet more republican senators and congressmen made no difference in the lives of the people who supported them.
bevin has spent four years mimicking president donald trump's bullying approach to politics. he has turned his ire on nearly anyone who questioned him, and the anger he inspired in so many kentuckians seemed to turn tuesday's election into a referendum on the governor, so much so that he was the only republican on kentucky's ballot who failed to win.
in the latest development, the patient called from abroad regarding the status of the appeal only to learn the insurance company had summarily withdrawn the appeal without notifying him. after lengthy conversations, including one disconnection, it appeared that a clerical mistake resulted in recording an incorrect case number. after correcting the error, the insurance company employee then noted that the file was incomplete, among other things it did not contain the dates of treatment—data that had previously been provided on several occasions.
both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure.
it's a small price to pay for the peace of mind in knowing that if they need time off for a health crisis or new child, they can take it, said milkman.
my entire life, i've been watching the lack of care for people, said pratt, a 47-year-old bus driver. in her view, the state's political leaders put money in their own pockets for everything, and i have been waiting for a revolution, of a sort.
sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) claims to already be working on a bipartisan health care bill ― a strategy endorsed by more moderate republicans, such as collins and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) ― but his idea of a bipartisan measure at this point sounds less than half-baked and far short of bipartisan.
administration officials and their kentucky counterparts have portrayed the plan as a way to improve the health of low-income residents and encourage self-sufficiency among poor but able-bodied adults. the result will be a transformational improvement in the overall health of our people and will provide a model for other states to follow, matt bevin, the state's republican governor, said at a press conference friday.
republicans take a different view. they are willing to give people a tax break to defray health insurance costs, and some republicans are even willing to extend assistance to lower-income people who don't make enough money to owe income taxes. but republicans reject the idea of government guaranteeing coverage, and their proposals to replace obamacare wouldn't even attempt to provide such a guarantee.
besides abortion, some groups do not cover preventive care, dentistry, vision, and mental health services.
it will be a perfect opportunity for the bad guys to learn to garden for a good cause in jersey. everyone knows the garden state is almost 9000 square miles of rolling farmland. the state is just waiting to produce more fresh fruits and vegetables.
one reason the 2010 signing ceremony felt like such a milestone was history. every democratic president since franklin d. roosevelt had at least contemplated pursuing major health reforms. most had failed and the most recent attempt, bill clinton's, was still a fresh memory.

the letter added: given the risk posed by covid-19, it is more important than ever for people to have health coverage. this will give people the opportunity to get the security and peace of mind that health care coverage provides.
the cbo has announced that it will release updated estimates of the republican health legislation's impact this coming wednesday. the analysis is expected to show that the current version of the house bill would deprive more people of insurance than the earlier iteration, which preserved more features of obamacare.
the trump administration's decision to join a conservative lawsuit challenging some of the most popular parts of the affordable care act continues to be the gift that keeps on giving, at least politically, for democrats ― first in the midterms and now in the upcoming supreme court fight.
at some point, i'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored, and i'll come back as a presidential person, and instead of 10,000 people, i'll have about 150 people, trump said, his voice oozing with the sarcasm of someone who thought that would be a terrible idea. and they'll say, 'boy. he really looks presidential.'
to level the playing field with countries such as china, the united states must also, among other things, devalue the dollar to make american exports more competitive in the global marketplace, scott said. it's an idea that has developed bipartisan traction in congress, but one in which trump has shown little interest.
the trump campaign released a vague second-term agenda on the eve of the convention on sunday, pledging to develop a vaccine by the end of 2020″ ― when deaths may exceed 200,000 ― and a return to normal in 2021.
still, the fact remains that the msm study populations of the global iprex study of prep and its open-label extension (ole) phase, as well as the subsequent u.s.-based prep demonstration project, were all made up of less than 10 percent african americans.
only bevin lost, but one bad apple did not spoil the bunch, scott jennings, a louisville-based gop strategist, wrote on twitter.
5. rudy giuliani will head new cyber security committee for trump. no one knows computers like rudy. he's on his computer all the time. more here.
her confirmation, which looks all but certain in the gop-controlled senate, would solidify a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court for the foreseeable future.
sen. susan collins (r-maine), who opposed the 2017 obamacare repeal effort, said the law needs to be repaired through legislation rather than eliminated by a legal challenge, which could throw the entire health care system into chaos. she urged the president to come up with an alternative plan before that happens.
we, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through seneca falls, and selma, and stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a king proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on earth.
pro-life protections: the bill does attempt to provide guardrails to prevent the tax credits from allowing federal funds from going to abortion services by defining coverage that is eligible for qualifying for the credit as a plan that does not provide coverage for abortions (other than any abortion necessary to the life of the mother or any abortion with respect to a pregnancy that is the result of an act of rape or incest). it is unclear if the language can survive senate byrd-rule scrutiny. this is also true of numerous other sections in the ways and means title.
i can't give you his answer because i haven't spoken to him yet, manchin added. all my legal minds, their brains are twisting and turning right now.
republicans introduced the proposal with the goal of enticing younger americans to buy health insurance and rebalance insurance risk pools, according to jost.
fast-forward 44 years and we have seen numerous advances in medicine for reproductive healthcare. from many years of collecting empirical evidence and tracking health outcomes, it is clear that having an abortion in 2017 is one of the safest medical procedures performed today. in fact, it has been proven that legally induced abortion is many times safer than childbirth.
the affordable care act provides two kinds of subsidy to address those issues.
the trump administration's (latest) position undermines the plaintiffs' arguments on both standing and constitutionality, keith wrote in an email to huffpost.
here's the rub: i fear that democrats are going to win a hollow victory this november.
but the harms that would befall the estimated 20 million people who would become uninsured if that lawsuit succeeds remain abstract. what's very real is that a growing number of americans are getting sick from a disease with no cure and are staring down life-destroying medical bills, and trump has decided the right thing to do about that is nothing.
mr. president, i was born with a disease called sarcoidosis, and from the day i was born, i was considered uninsurable, blaque said. that disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when i went to graduate school, into my brain. … with copays, i'm still paying almost $7,000 a year in addition to the copay.
the affordable care act, which created the exchanges, anticipated a moment like this. even in the states where people can't enroll because of the trump administration and the idaho government, they still can qualify for health insurance and income-based subsidies under certain circumstances, such as losing a job. the law allows for special enrollment periods for emergencies, which is why 11 states and the district of columbia have taken advantage of the option.
moore is so bad that an editor at the kansas city star once refused to run literally anything he ever wrote, because a piece moore had previously published in the paper was so littered with basic factual errors. he's a living embodiment of the worst elements of the economics profession ― a man who doesn't care about the truth, abuses statistics, makes outlandish predictions, smears his opponents and never pays any professional price.
the effects of some of these changes will become apparent this fall, right before election day, as consumers begin to learn what coverage for next year will cost.
but since effectively capturing the nomination, biden has emphasized his commitment to moving toward both universal coverage and a health care system more reliant on government-run insurance, eventually signing off on a party platform that welcomes medicare for all's advocates.
what happens when a president is willing to let the health care system he is now responsible for, in his own words, 'explode'?
it's not exactly a secret that the political operatives who hire economists in washington don't actually care if economists get things right. they care if economists are willing to say the right things, support party policy and speak the language of prestigious professionals to at least give that policy the pretense of legitimacy.
sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) said trump's infrastructure package would have to be big enough to make a dent, and it would have to have a mechanism for financing.
bloomberg via getty images progressives are showing house speaker nancy pelosi deference, even as she has lobbed slights at their causes.
as we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
the thing is, pelosi's crumbs comment is fair and accurate. by republicans' tally, more than 250 businesses have doled out some $3 billion worth of bonuses so far. the joint committee on taxation expects the corporate tax cut by itself to lose $101 billion worth of revenue this year alone.
what can you do?? - send an email to your local state legislatures. share this article with them. tell them how the spend-down affects you or someone you know directly. call your state legislatures. simply tell them to raise the spend-down standards. ask for an appointment to meet with your state representative and senator in person (if you're able).
lobbying organizations for health insurers neither rejected nor endorsed the bill. america's health insurance plans and the blue cross blue shield association offered praise for short-term elements designed to shore up the health insurance market in the next two years. but they also expressed concern about medicaid funding cuts and inadequate financial assistance for private coverage.
feminists support upholding roe v. wade. amy coney barrett does not. feminists support government policies to ensure equality and equity for women. amy coney barrett does not. feminists value the importance of affirmative action, environmental protection, and universal health care. amy coney barrett does not, said jennifer lawless, a political science professor at the university of virginia. opposing a female nominee who is antithetical to feminist principles reflects a commitment to the cause.
mccain described trump's july 2018 summit with putin ― where trump once again refused to fully accept u.s. intelligence agencies' assessment of russian interference in the 2016 election ― as one of the most disgraceful performances by an american president in memory.
i've watched republicans abuse the rules when they're out of power, then turn around and blow off the rules when they're in power. elizabeth warren in new york city
all the same, leadership may want to double-check their head count.
private, nonprofit yale new haven health system files liens only if a bill is over $10,000 and then only if the property is worth at least $300,000, a spokesman said. falls church, va.-based inova health says it does not file liens on patient homes or garnish wages.
the latter view dominates in the south, the plains and parts of the midwest, which explains why those tend to be the states with the most dysfunctional markets and highest numbers of uninsured residents.
changing that narrative may prove difficult. in a survey conducted by republican pollsters for a pro-trump organization, only half of the voters in gop-held congressional districts support the plan, even after being introduced to key features of the bill and hearing the messages on both sides of the tax reform debate. even among americans who'll see their taxes fall, there's no guarantee that they'll notice — or that they'll look more fondly on the republicans' effort.
during last year's open enrollment, for example, the percentage of 18-to-34-year-olds signing up for coverage increased with time. it would spike at each meaningful deadline, such as the final day to get coverage in time for jan. 1, and then again the final day to get coverage for the year.

in the late stages of a legislative fight, rallying votes is more about politics than policy ― and, for sure, the obama administration made plenty of quiet deals to keep wavering democrats in the fold. but obama could defend the core of his plan because he understood it and quite obviously believed in it. knowledge meant power and control.
fox and yost agree with that. but in their brief, they go further, arguing that the framers of the constitution never intended to give judges such sweeping powers to invalidate laws, even though modern-day judges do that sort of thing frequently.
washington (reuters) - the trump administration said on thursday it would allow states to test requiring some medicaid recipients to work or participate in community activities such as volunteering or jobs training as a condition of eligibility for the government health insurance program for the poor.
the legal questions surrounding secession were settled by the civil war and then in texas v. white 74 u.s. 700 (1869) when the supreme court ruled that states could not voluntarily withdraw from the united states. writing for the court, justice salmon chase observed that [w]hen, therefore, texas became one of the united states, she entered into an indissoluble relation. the u.s. constitution, one might further recall, begins with we the people rather than we the states, assuring the legitimacy of the federal government was based on the consent of the people and not on the states.
reality is actually quite different. although insurers in many states have struggled, markets in other states are stable. recent news suggests that this year's steep price increases for some may be a one-time correction.
although biden's proposed scheme would provide much-needed assistance and security to millions of americans now burdened by medical bills, it would stop well short of medicare for all's wholesale transformation of the health care system. government would not be setting budgets and prices throughout the health care system, private insurance would likely remain the dominant form of coverage, and a significant number of americans would remain uninsured.
with a few of my female friends who support hillary, the discussion of hillary's pros and cons has quickly given way to the fact that these women really want america to have its first female president. a few of those arguments have been it's time america had a woman president, i'm sick of men always being in charge, a woman president will be an amazing example for my daughter, and i want my mother/grandmother to see america's first woman president before she dies. if i respond with something like, i also want america to have its first female president, but hillary being a woman isn't enough for me, i've gotten a response like, that's easy for you to say. you're a man. there's really not much to discuss after that.
the percentage of people on the hook for higher costs would generally be fairly small. but the rate shock that came with the affordable care act, when people suddenly discovered their insurance cost more than it did the previous year, also affected a tiny portion of the population. it created a huge backlash anyway.
the house financial services committee chair, rep. maxine waters (d-calif.), reluctantly indulged him. she ruled that mchenry was correct about the notification norms and said that porter would have to delay her inquiry while the committee figured out a way to get her whiteboard displayed on screens so that all members could see it. porter said she'd just proceed without the whiteboard after all.
trump's refusal to explore the possibility of cross-party collaboration may stand in sharp contrast to obama's approach, but it is also an illustration of the widely divergent philosophical approaches each has taken to health care reform. whereas obama largely attempted to recreate on a national scale the system implemented in massachusetts by then-gov. mitt romney ― and frustrated democrats with his willingness to jettison liberal proposals like a public option ― trump has stayed committed to a conservative framework of reform, backing a bill that would reduce the size of government subsidies and restrict the expansion of medicaid despite campaign pledges to do neither.
or, if they want to get creative, they could issue a ruling that finds the mandate unconstitutional but leaves the rest of obamacare standing. one candidate to take such a vote would be a trump appointee, brett kavanaugh. in two cases this past session, he made arguments about a key principle, severability, that court watchers interpreted as a signal he might vote just that way.
she ousted one of the more conservative house democrats on social issues, especially abortion. a devout catholic, the 53-year-old lipinski voted against the affordable care act because of its mandate that employer insurance plans cover birth control. he has supported defunding planned parenthood and clinics that offer abortion services, and has sided with republicans on bills that would ban abortions at 20 weeks into a woman's pregnancy.
the ruling was for a case called texas v. u.s., which a group of republican state officials brought two years ago. according to the lawsuit, president donald trump and the republicans rendered the law's individual mandate unconstitutional when, as part of the 2017 tax cut, they reduced the mandate's financial penalty to zero. and if the mandate is unconstitutional, the lawsuit claims, the entire law must go.
north carolina's 9th congressional district: rep. dan bishop (r) vs. cynthia wallace (d)
the statue of george washington on the steps of the south carolina statehouse in columbia, south carolina.
donald trump has been bashing obamacare a lot lately. this week, he did so in a state that's become a major focus of his presidential campaign ― michigan.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued guidance making it easier for states to design and propose test programs that implement such requirements. states must propose such changes through waivers and receive federal approval.
the health care law's architects also backed off some of the most aggressive proposed cuts to the health care industry, in order to keep those groups from using their lobbying power to block the bill's passage. this included a decision to drop the public option, which not just insurers but also hospitals and doctors opposed because it would pay them less money.
our coverage has gotten worse, our deductibles got higher, our premiums went higher. i'm looking for options. tim franklin, kansas farmer
one thing i always ask my doctor now is, if you're going to send me for blood work, can you please send out the samples to an in-network lab? i've seen so many patients with in-network doctors who send blood to an out-of-network lab, and the prices for something simple can be literally 20 times more what they would be if they were sent to one of the commercial labs that's in-network. another question that patients should ask is, why? do i really need that extra x-ray? will the x-ray change what we do? and if the answer is no, then maybe you hold off for now.
the expansion is the primary reason the number of americans without health insurance reached record lows after the affordable care act took effect. for millions, it has meant less financial hardship, more access to medical care and better health, according to a large and still growing body of research. the expansion requires new government spending, as any expansion of government insurance would, but mostly it's coming from the federal government.
the aca's risk adjustment system has been the target of federal litigation because some insurers said it treated their plans unfairly. in one of those cases, a federal judge in new mexico ruled that the system is flawed ― a decision, the administration says, that means the payments must stop for now.
these four counties have experienced significant increases in people being hospitalized due to covid-19 and today's action is a precautionary step to help ensure that the hospitals in these counties continue to have ample supply of available beds to treat covid-19 patients, the governor said thursday in a statement. as we work to contain this virus, i urge all texans to do their part to help contain the spread by washing their hands regularly, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing.
the people living in the 38 states that use healthcare.gov ― and those in idaho, which hasn't reactivated its state-run exchange ― will likely remain uninsured, leaving them potentially exposed to tens of thousands of dollars in costs if they get sick from the novel coronavirus and need medical treatment.
or they could scale back this work, as they did early this year, and leave enrollees to their own devices, which would result in lower enrollment overall and likely make the insurance pool sicker, because those with the greatest health care needs would be the most prone to sign up without help or reminders.
whether it succeeds in reducing drug prices meaningfully ultimately will depend on a number of factors, not least among them the ability ― and willingness ― of state negotiators to exclude popular but duplicative drugs from coverage because manufacturers won't agree to lower prices.
at the top of that list are hospitals, which alone account for roughly one-third of the nation's health care spending. no other sector, not even pharmaceuticals, rivals it. under the medicare for all proposals from sanders as well as some other potential reforms getting attention these days, the federal government would limit payments to hospitals, quite possibly reducing their incomes significantly.
the republicans' last-ditch campaign message before the midterms has gone exactly where you might have expected: trying to instill sheer terror of what democratic control of one branch of government might bring. the president's auxiliary super pac raises the ominous specter in a closing ad: violence, socialism and undefended open borders.
but those people will also be paying exorbitantly more for that coverage, and there's hardly any way for republicans to mask that.
election day didn't meet mayville's highest expectations. mostly in the boise suburbs and in lewiston, on the border with washington state, about 200 volunteers collected 5,000 signatures, half of what he wanted.
i'm quite confident that unless the administration decides to not steward the exchanges because they have some draconian negotiating strategy that the exchanges will be fine next year, said andy slavitt, who oversaw the exchanges as acting administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services under president barack obama.
brandishing a wire coat hanger, new york gubernatorial candidate cynthia nixon took the podium at a rally against the nomination of judge brett m. kavanaugh to the supreme court earlier this month. kavanaugh is thought to satisfy donald trump's pledge to appoint justices who will vote to overturn roe v. wade. nixon's voice shook as she predicted that a newly conservative court would take the country back to a time when women — including her own mother — resorted to self-administered abortions with, yes, coat hangers, or to illegal and unlicensed practitioners to end their pregnancies.
in crime novelist agatha christie's biggest hit, and then there were none, guests at an island mansion die suspicious deaths one after another.
conservatives have long held that u. s. health care should be based on the free market, that the role of government should be minimal, and that a deregulated marketplace can resolve issues of access, costs, affordability and quality of care. (1) we have been told this so often that these unproven claims have become a meme: a self-replicating myth or slogan that by constant repetition becomes part of everyday language, without regard to its merit.
every second counts. it's not about a year, it's about the day, the week, the month, the next six months, biden said, recalling his own experience watching loved ones go through terminal illness. the truth of the matter is, it's likely to be a bumpy ride getting to where we're going.
ralph norman for congress republican ralph norman has taken staunch conservative positions on obamacare, social security and guns.
many democratic-led states, such as maine, colorado and new mexico, have passed laws designed to reduce harmful emissions, but the size of new york's economy is what makes this plan so ambitious.
readler is one of three circuit court nominees who were slated for senate confirmation votes this week who have commonalities beyond being trump's picks. they are young, they are right-wing ideologues and they are members of the conservative federalist society, which has been driving trump's judicial selection process by funneling anti-abortion and anti-lgbtq prospective nominees to the white house.
in response to such rulings, the ministries sought laws that would partly or wholly shield them from regulation by state insurance departments. today, 30 states have such laws on the books. many of them look a lot like a template from the american legislative exchange council, the conservative policy network, which the organization calls the freedom to share act.
the lynns decided bankruptcy was their only option.
that problem is compounded by all the loose ends in the next piece of legislation. democrats don't have much of an idea as to what is actually going in the next bill, largely because it'll be subject to negotiations between speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) and treasury secretary steven mnuchin.
few of his opponents were spared during the private lunch, which was attended by anchors from abc, nbc, cbs, c-span and fox news.
instead of working hard for south carolina, he sits on tv with sean hannity. it shows you where we are in terms of the priority scales, harrison said monday at a campaign stop in columbia.
less disruption, for better and for worse
financial services firms have responded to increased regulation and risk by hiring thousands of new compliance staff to handle manual data collection, manipulation, remediation, and reporting tasks. this leaves little time for value-added analysis of the data that can give them real insight into how their business is using a variety of communications and collaboration channels. we believe that a consolidated platform with value-added analytics helps firms reduce overhead and make the compliance function more nimble and focused on high-value business analysis. the next phase of our investment will focus on consolidating, automating, and simplifying processes and systems to free up compliance officers to provide real insight and value-added analysis back into the business, collet continues.
overall, while there is no sense that public opinion within any state (even texas) is supportive of secession, support is perhaps larger and more widespread than one might initially imagine.
yeah, so, well, we made a couple of important decisions. first of all, i understand the concern. so that's something we are supportive of ― to make sure that we address that to people's satisfaction.
on the one hand i was horrified. and yet. while canvassing for hillary, i'd developed a genuine interest in objections to the most qualified candidate ever. i wanted to hear what he had to say.
it would likely replace existing employer-sponsored plans, over the course of a decadelong transition, but it would allow private insurers to offer an alternative form of coverage, much as they do today for seniors on medicare. the harris plan would also allow employers to contract directly with companies offering these alternative plans and make them available to employees.
we also neglected, amid a sea of trump team disgracefulness, to mention that two weeks ago devos's department invited representatives of the right-wing evangelical groups family research council and focus on the family to appear on a panel at a department conference on engaging fathers and families. among other atrocities, both groups oppose lgbtq rights and support the odious practice of gay conversion therapy. devos didn't attend the event and has said she opposes conversion therapy, but members of the devos family are major donors to both of these family organizations. and earlier this year, devos, trump, and attorney general jeff sessions teamed up to cancel obama protections for transgender schoolchildren.
the approaches to health care that biden or harris advocate may be closer to what democratic voters want. or they might not be. the only way to find out is to make sure voters understand how the different approaches work — and, at least on wednesday, biden and harris weren't much help.
before the passage of aca, too many people faced medical bankruptcy, increased disability, even death. and even with it, close to 30 million people remain uninsured, and that number may now be much higher due to covid-19 related layoffs. too many people have had to make difficult decisions about whether they should quit school, give up a job or their home because they couldn't afford to pay their bills and pay for medical care. they have been forced to choose between living their lives and living ― and that's not ok. that should never be allowed.
uva sued carolyn davis, 55, of halifax county, for $7,448 to pay for nerve injections to treat back pain that she hadn't realized would be out-of-network.
republicans have seized on that problem, arguing it's proof the law is a failure. their solution is to reverse the process.
it hurts so bad, and you wish you could quit it. but you're driving down the highway and it comes on the radio, or you're at the newsstand to get gum and you see the headlines ― you can't get the disgracefulness of donald trump and his crew out of your face, or out of your mind. so you plunge back in, with another edition of trump team disgracefulness power rankings. damnit.
during oral arguments this week in zubik v. burwell -- a set of seven challenges to obamacare's contraceptive-coverage mandate on behalf of religious nonprofits -- chief justice john roberts and his colleagues on the court's conservative wing gave the impression that they don't really grasp what the aca's health insurance exchanges do, or indeed how the market for health insurance itself even functions.
to be fair, using roberts' argument about taxing and obama's argument that the affordable care act couldn't work without the mandate against them is clever, in a high school debate club kind of way.
it seems insane that republican lawmakers are begging trump to tweet them instructions, as if they take their marching orders from an obscure numbers station. but the fact of the matter is that republicans haven't had an original thought on what to do about obamacare in years. the threat of president barack obama's veto pen has always protected them from the consequences of a repeal vote.
how exactly the subsidies would still work under this scenario is unclear, since their value is calculated based on the cost of a standard insurance policy in each geographic area, and such a benchmark plan can't exist if insurers can vary prices by each customer's health status.
ellesia blaque, an assistant professor, pressed trump during an abc news town hall with voters in philadelphia. during a tense moment, blaque detailed her experience with a lifelong disease that costs her thousands of dollars annually in insurance copayments.
people struggling with high premiums today will discover short-term plans are a lot cheaper ― and many who opt for that coverage will be just fine. but the buyers who get serious medical problems will face crippling medical bills and in many cases, they won't know about this exposure until it is too late, because the companies and brokers who sell these plans are notorious for hiding limits and exclusions in the fine print.
but warren's plan also has its barriers: killing the filibuster in the senate requires the cooperation of other democratic senators. so far, vanishingly few have endorsed fully eliminating the 60-vote requirement for most major legislation, even as both parties have slowly chipped away at the rule.
one reason he finally felt sufficiently confident in medi-share, he explained, was that he found out it counted toward the individual mandate. we don't have to pay a penalty when we pay our taxes, tracy said, cradling one of the twins in his lap. so they have to follow ― in my opinion, and my doctor feels the same way ― they have to follow federal, or obamacare, rules.
washington -- kentucky has turned into the place where obamacare repeal rhetoric meets obamacare repeal reality. reality is winning.
property liens do give uva a claim on the equity in patients' homes.
michigan's insurers have seen some of these problems, too.
the legislation is certainly not helping [people of color] by trying to equalize wealth or equalize incomes or anything like that, said elaine maag, a senior research associate at the urban-brookings tax policy center.
he kept his word, pence said. he's going to do that in the fall of 2020, and in the next four years, he'll keep his word and appoint more principled conservatives to our courts.
the affordable care act's medicaid expansion poses more of a problem for the repeal effort in the senate, as well. sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska), for example, has already said she can't support a bill that would cut funding for her state's medicaid expansion, while conservatives like sen. rand paul (r-ky.) say they won't support a bill that doesn't end the expansion.
but perhaps most importantly, the democratic party, for all of its misgivings and internal ideological divisions, was largely united around its vision for reform. it had been since the beginning of the legislative effort. after more than a year of intense debate in congress, the party was also resolute in its determination to finish the job ― to take a giant leap on a journey that had begun three-quarters of a century before, when harry truman launched the first formal effort at creating a national health insurance program.
the kansas farm bureau bill has drawn the ire of the state's largest insurer, blue cross blue shield of kansas, which eventually took its case to twitter.
constituents at a florida town hall that rep. gus bilirakis (r-fla.) hosted erupted when another republican official made the long-debunked claim that americans are subject to so-called death panels under the affordable care act.
the way we really won in republican-leaning districts of the state legislature was talking about the specifics of health care ― particularly breast cancer and prostate cancer and other cancer screenings and other prevention, hanauer recently told the huffington post. thirteen years later, those same issues are, i believe, going to tear this party potentially apart if they don't smell the coffee.
as for congress as a whole, republican lawmakers are more or less or stammering their way through justifications or misgivings.
this is the kind of nuanced understanding of our country that can appeal to americans of every stripe. given that being american is the only thing that connects all of us who live here to one another, the only bond with any kind of cultural and historical content that can cross all the other group lines that divide us, we need a workable concept of americanness and of our collective history. as i've written elsewhere:
proponents of the new policy tout the flexibility it provides states to remake their health care programs for low-income people, but the reality is that flexibility would translate into states cutting enrollment, cutting benefits or both.
the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit heard it next. in a 2-to-1 decision, a pair of republican-appointed justices agreed with o'connor's basic finding. but they also remanded the case back to him, with instructions to consider more carefully whether perhaps some parts of the law can stay.
if nothing else, obama's presidential run in 2008 revealed, if just for the months of that historic campaign, what we could be when the best of who we are comes together for a common purpose; when there are love and compassion and kindness and nonviolence and peace and a vision for the human family; when we are coming together, not fighting or destroying each other.
from the way jason cianciotto, vice president of policy and advocacy for harlem united, categorizes the challenge at hand, it's going to take a lot more than advertising to work against the societal forces impeding prep's success among black msm in new york city and across the country.
on capital gains taxes, obama increased the rate paid by those in the top bracket by 5 percent, and also added a separate 3.8 percent increase -- the funds from which go to medicare -- to the rate paid by those in the top three brackets. additionally, obamacare included a separate, broader income tax surcharge of 0.9 percent on higher-income households. and those obamacare-related tax increases don't go into the general budget -- a good chunk of which gets spent on things like defense and corporate subsidies -- it goes right back out the door to lower-income families in the form of premium subsidies that help buy health insurance. as paul krugman pointed out, obamacare represents an important redistributionist policy -- the biggest such policy since the 1960s.
no more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing medicare for all proposals. the only exception would be a provision in the sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.
it's important to distinguish between actual support for pre-existing condition protections and lip service, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university's center for health insurance reform, told huffpost. the problem with the multiple efforts to repeal the aca and 'replace' its pre-existing condition protections with alternatives ― such as the [final house] amendment and the bills that have been introduced more recently ― is that they all include massive loopholes that will make coverage effectively inaccessible for people with health care needs.
meanwhile, trump declined to take up a number of bipartisan priorities that he claimed, as a candidate, he would act on. his administration's periodic rhetorical nods to infrastructure investment have become a beltway punchline rather than a credible bill.
bevin shouldn't be vulnerable, at least not as vulnerable as he is. for four years, the governor has presented himself as kentucky's version of president donald trump: he regularly blasts his critics in social media tirades that are filled with petty insults about journalists who cover him, judges who issue rulings he dislikes and political opponents (from his party or the other) who dare question him.
update: 7:51 p.m. ― douglas elmendorf, who was cbo director when congress wrote the affordable act act, and is now dean of the john f. kennedy school of government at harvard university, fired back at gop criticisms in an email to the huffington post:
majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is expected to release the text of a revised bill thursday, along with an amendment drafted by sen. ted cruz (r-texas) that would dramatically undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the name of lowering costs for healthy people. on wednesday afternoon, cruz suggested, but did not directly state, that he would vote against the motion to proceed on the bill if his amendment was not attached.
in 2016, voters in georgia and arizona decisively handed new six-year terms to two veteran republican senators. johnny isakson won a 13 percentage point victory in the peach state, while john mccain won reelection with a similar margin in arizona. both men's new terms would have lasted until 2022.
josh hicks is taking over amy mcgrath's mission to kick republican rep. andy barr out of congress. in 2018, mcgrath proved that the district, which encompasses lexington and the surrounding suburbs, wasn't as solidly conservative as republicans thought, with the former marine fighter pilot coming within three points of the four-term congressman.
the american academy of pediatrics has promoted breastfeeding as the healthiest start for both infants and their mothers. the share of infants who are breastfed increased from 73.8% to 83.2% between 2004 and 2015, as more doctors in the u.s. encourage mothers to feed their babies exclusively breast milk for six months and continue nursing for a year or more. but the reality is that the united states does not guarantee paid leave by law, and many mothers end up going back to work in less than two weeks. for those who want to breastfeed, that means most have to pump ― every 2-3 hours throughout the workday, and for as long as it takes to fully empty their breasts, which can take 15-30 minutes.
an analysis by americans for tax fairness, a group that opposed the tax bill, put the stock buyback total at $100 billion since the senate passed the bill in early december. senate democrats arrived at a similar tally for just this year.
thompson, an account executive with a medicaid managed care company, said health care, elder care and long-term support services are her top concerns in the new year, which is why she also likes buttigieg. i like two things about pete. young. his ideas about health care, he says 'medicare for all' is good, but you can keep your private health insurance if you want it, she explained.
a tracking survey from the kaiser family foundation released wednesday breaks down expectations further, finding that about half, 48 percent, expects the replacement plan to decrease the number of people with health insurance and to increase costs for people who buy their own insurance. a smaller 41 percent plurality expect the replacement to lead to higher deductibles, while 45 percent say the new plan would leave protections for people with pre-existing conditions about the same.
having health insurance is still law of the land, counihan said. if the president and republicans in congress want to change that, they should come up with a plan and show it to the american people, rather than depriving americans of the chance to sign up for coverage and financial assistance they remain eligible for.
i still have remaining questions, particularly on the medicaid expansion side, but i feel like it's gelling and we're moving in a direction where those 184,000 people that i've been talking about are going to be able to stay insured and have a stable transition period, moore capito told huffpost.
washington ― barack obama paid what's likely to be his last visit to capitol hill as president on wednesday and beseeched congressional democrats to fight to protect the affordable care act from republican efforts to unravel it.

it's hard to process all that has happened in the past few weeks with the introduction, then withdrawal on friday of the american heath care act. was the bill pulled back because it was so bad or because it wasn't bad enough? was the main consideration in all of this political jockeying the futures of so many members of congress – their re-electability if they were tied to this bill? or the risk to their re-elections of not fulfilling the campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare? is the bottom line, as the sunday talk shows would imply, the reputation of supposed deal-maker donald trump, or the future of house speaker paul ryan, or the ability of the democrats to sit back and gloat? has everyone seemingly forgotten that we are talking about people's lives here?
wednesday, the administration said it had reconsidered in light of o'connor's ruling. the remaining provisions of the aca should not be allowed to remain in effect — again, even if the government might support some individual positions as a policy matter, the administration wrote in its court filing.
but beshear's basic argument is an appeal to kentuckians' allegedly genteel political preferences, and their pocketbooks, too. bevin's a bully, and for all the wrong reasons. it's not just this governor's approach or that he calls people names, beshear said. it's that his policies are detrimental to kentucky.
griffin pivarunas for khn waldron learned after her uva hospitalization that a computer error involving a policy bought on healthcare.gov had led her insurance to lapse.
one new slotkin ad includes a video of her mother giving a toast at slotkin's wedding, which the couple moved to an earlier date so that slotkin's mom could be there. when i saw congressman bishop at the white house... something inside me broke, slotkin says in the spot. mr. bishop, that's dereliction of duty, and it's a fireable offense.
senators voted 81-18 for a three-week funding measure to reopen the government, with many democrats saying they felt encouraged by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's (r-ky.) assurance over the weekend that the senate would proceed to an immigration bill soon.
as a doctor, a scientist, an epidemiologist, i can tell you with 100% certainty that in most states where you're seeing an increase, it is a real increase, frieden told fox news sunday.
donald bowers via getty images warren buffett and jamie dimon, ceos of berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan chase, respectively, say they are joining forces, along with amazon, to manage the health care needs of their employees.
senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch (r-utah) has co-sponsored health care reform bills in previous years, but they lacked the imprimatur of senate republican leaders.
senate district 10 special election win by a democrat is a wake up call for republicans in wisconsin. — scott walker (@scottwalker) january 17, 2018
under trump's proposal, these plans could leave out a lot of key benefits, making their premiums lower. that's appealing to those who need coverage the least and unappealing to people who have to have medical care.
knowing you as i do, i know that you are troubled by the direction of your party. little wonder -- you are mainstream republicans whose mainstream has run dry. but i also accept that, for you, the democrats may not be the answer -- that you see them as feckless devotees of identity politics and too much government, don't trust hillary clinton, and believe that bernie sanders would drive us off the fiscal cliff. i'm not writing to quarrel with these beliefs. nor do i suggest that unchallenged dominance by the democrats would serve the country well.
there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
we lost another type 1 diabetic due to insulin rationing, smith-holt said. this is something you know we hoped would never happen again.
it is not right that one senator can grind the entire process to a halt, sanders said.
this is petty, gingrich told reporters, according to a nov. 17, 1995, article in the washington post. [but] you land at andrews [air force base] and you've been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp. … you just wonder, where is their sense of manners? where is their sense of courtesy?
nobody knows health care better than donald trump, he said on abc's this week with george stephanopoulos.

sen. sanders wants to dismantle obamacare, dismantle the chip program, dismantle medicare, and dismantle private insurance, she said during a campaign stop in new hampshire. i worry if we give republicans democratic permission to do that, we'll go back to an era -- before we had the affordable care act -- that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.
the reason, as economist linda blumberg of the urban institute think tank explained to huffpost, is that employers would still have tons of incentive to offer insurance.
so, why not share the cost of your medical treatments?
instead, they looked for ways to attack the law. and they found quite a few.
were i to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what i believe my oath and the constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, i fear, expose my character to history's rebuke, and the censure of my own conscience, romney said on the senate floor wednesday.
but public opinion shifted once trump's victory and republican control of congress made repeal a real possibility. for the first time, the debate shifted to the parts of the law voters valued and what republicans were proposing as an alternative. nearly every plan the gop advanced promised to weaken or eliminate altogether obamacare's guardrails for people, regardless of their medical status.
over the objections of local politicians, obama designated roughly 1.35 million acres in san juan county, utah, as a national monument. chaffetz and the rest of the utah congressional delegation want trump to reverse that action, as locals worry that the designation might prevent them from collecting firewood or visiting sacred sites to perform religious ceremonies.
though the first night of the second democratic presidential debate in detroit presented a cleaner ideological divide between progressive and moderate candidates on stage, the second debate on wednesday was marked by an all-out siege on the front-runner: former vice president joe biden.
but mccain was on a roll.
warren isn't totally alone in seeking to change washington's structure, though her vision is the most comprehensive. both govs. jay inslee of washington state and steve bullock of montana are open to eliminating the 60-vote rule, and california sen. kamala harris said she was open to a conversation about increasing the number of seats on the supreme court.
the fight over health care in the democratic primaries took a turn for the nasty this week when former vice president joe biden said that proponents of the idea were, like republicans, intent on getting rid of the affordable care act.
the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on obamacare, to build on what we did, biden said thursday, highlighting his preference for a public option that would be available to everyone in lieu of private insurance.
over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
at a minimum, sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) has suggested republicans could fund the so-called cost-sharing reductions (csrs), which subsidize the cost of obamacare plans for people with incomes up to 250 percent of the poverty level. president donald trump has threatened to end those payments, and, in response to that uncertainty, insurers have offered more expensive plans or simply not offered plans at all.
it was a puzzle that you had to do 535 times, because you were basically solving it for every member of the house and every member of the senate, nancy-ann deparle, who ran the white house office of health reform under obama, told huffpost in a recent interview.
ends the individual mandate. penalties under the individual mandate would disappear, retroactive to dec. 31, 2015. insurers depend on the mandate to make sure healthy people don't wait until getting sick before buying coverage. doing away with these fines removes a key incentive for consumers to keep the insurance they have now or to buy next year, which could result in higher premiums for those sicker people who remain in the system.
all four nights of the democratic national convention were dedicated, in part, to pushing back against different arguments the trump campaign might deploy down the stretch as the president attempts to climb out of the hole he finds himself in.
the last time subsidizing health care for undocumented residents got attention in national politics was in 2009, during the debate over what became the affordable care act, when some republicans insisted, wrongly, the bill would pay to cover undocumented residents. a republican u.s. house member famously shouted you lie! in the middle of a joint address to congress that then-president barack obama was delivering.
that showed me a lot, jones said. he at least made an appearance to try to assure people he was going to do everything he could.
some education and work experience preferred but not required
in fact, the biggest complaints hillary supporters seem to have against bernie is that he wouldn't be able to defeat the republican nominee, his ideas are too idealistic and unachievable, and that his supporters are mean -- even though nearly every poll shows bernie beating any republican nominee by much wider margins than hillary would, and most of what bernie is calling for is already enjoyed by nearly every industrialized nation. as to whether berners, as a group, are mean, that brings us to...
just this week, new york mayor bill de blasio proposed giving workers in the city two weeks of paid time off each year ― the nation's first guaranteed vacation policy.
in both the email to supporters and a video uploaded to youtube on monday, biden directly addressed democratic supporters of medicare for all, saying he opposes any plan that would overturn former president barack obama's signature health care law.
the way interior has acted under the trump administration is the textbook definition of a political cartel, using state resources to help the special interests, wyden said. and it sure looks to me like mr. jorjani has been a key member of the cartel.
but republicans don't look all that interested in that white flag approach ― at least not until they've demonstrated they can't pass a bill of their own. and even then, republican leaders see big problems if they can't muscle through this health care legislation.
love or hate obamacare, the law is nine years old and has integrated itself into american health care. the millions and millions of people who would lose their health coverage if the affordable care act disappears would be the most direct victims, but the law's reach goes much further than that.
franklin later told huffpost that his family makes too much to qualify for financial assistance, but not by much, making the costs a significant burden. our coverage has gotten worse, our deductibles got higher, our premiums went higher, he said. i'm looking for options.
mykel king will cast his first vote this year. and he's feeling overwhelmed.
they'll let us know when it's done and then tell us how to vote, the member said.
the democratic party's so-called medicare for all would really be medicare for none. president donald trump
still, republicans insisted on wednesday that making another run at repealing obamacare was a matter worth discussing even though it would prove more difficult this year than it did when they controlled both houses of congress.
but now that lawmakers are playing with live rounds this time, in the words of rep. charlie dent (r-pa.), some republicans are showing reluctance to actually get rid of a program that has won over a number of republican governors and covers more than 14 million people.
if i'm still the majority leader of the senate after next year, none of those things are going to pass the senate, he said. they won't even be voted on.
you know why i tried it ? first, because i trust her implicitly regarding food -- she knows food --and second, because i caught myself. i thought, that's not you, judy... you try the octopus! and when i did, i loved it! i mean, i really loved it!
before my bum even hit the chair, the president said, 'no oversight. you can't talk about anything that has to do with oversight,' chaffetz said. instead, they talked about chaffetz's reform agenda, including civil service reform and the postal service, an aide told huffpost. but first, they began the meeting by discussing the bears ears monument in utah.
the argument's strained logic has provoked not just criticism but also some outright derision, even from conservative and libertarian lawyers who helped to craft and promote previous lawsuits against the affordable care act.
announcement of the proposal, which has been in the works for several months, came two months after president donald trump signed republican legislation eliminating the individual mandate, which makes people pay a financial penalty if they don't have insurance.
as a candidate, trump promised to replace the affordable care act, or obamacare, with something terrific that provided universal coverage at a lower cost. and before his time in political life, he spoke glowingly about single-payer health care. but as president, he and his party have pursued policies designed to reduce coverage and shift costs onto patients.
but the administration's decision could be significant for two other reasons.
one sign of the shifting debate came on tuesday, when sen. elizabeth warren from massachusetts became the latest high-profile democrat to introduce a bill to upgrade the affordable care act ― in this case, by offering more financial assistance to people buying insurance on their own and bolstering the law's consumer protections.
similarly, humana, which has already announced that it will not provide any plans under aca exchanges next year, leaves many counties in tennessee without any aca insurance options.
associated press sen. susan collins (r-maine) has traditionally received support from planned parenthood, but many liberal activists want the group to drop her in 2020 because of her support for supreme court justice brett kavanaugh.
while serve america has not endorsed conservative democrats with views far to the right of the party's mainstream, none of its candidates have been especially progressive either.
then again, this was florida, a red state i'd never planned to call home. but when my mother died, i needed sunshine and a break from manhattan. the relocation was meant to be temporary. then it turned out that florida was good for work. i had just enough business to keep me afloat, with ample time for my own writing, friends, and beach-going. the simple fact that i could drive to the grocery store felt luxurious after 10 years in the city.
rep. jim mcgovern (d-mass.), who is leading the charge against the food benefit regulation, described the possible poverty threshold change as yet another attempt by the administration to screw poor people.
the ahca is dead...for now. a reminder that there is no fear or anxiety or sadness you feel that cannot be cured by political action. — chris murphy (@chrismurphyct) march 24, 2017
but would republicans be preserving the medicaid expansion?
leida called the dispute another headwind that we are facing in an already troubled, stormy sea.
with millions of americans struggling to pay their medical bills, even with the affordable care act in place, the idea of creating a single, national health insurance program that would cover nearly all medical expenses is attracting greater interest than it has in many decades.
the last two elections saw obama so famously promoting affordable education and healthcare ('obamacare'), but housing affordability has still been somewhat ignored. the reason for its lack of publicity thus far is quite simple: most of the candidates simply haven't started campaigning within the states where the worst cases of the housing crisis lie.
president barack obama took notice. he called fluke to express his sympathies and to thank her for speaking out. a top-flight democratic communications firm signed on to help her with her new fame, the democratic national committee came calling about a speaking gig at the convention, and fluke eventually caught the political bug.
trump and house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) may yet succeed in their effort to undo most of that. but they faces challenges that reflect upon their preparation, their seriousness and, ultimately, their priorities.
these are by no means the only problems with the lawsuit, as a chorus of legal experts, liberal and conservative alike, have been arguing from the get-go.
there doesn't appear to be a good answer.
aarp has expressed its opposition to the bill in a letter to congress, and is running internet ads and radio ads attacking the 5-to-1 age ratio and other provisions. it also plans to send each of its members a mailer showing how their member of congress voted on the bill, and to keep members up to date via email and social media.
to date, 36 states plus washington, d.c., have expanded medicaid. by 2017, expansion under the aca had covered 17 million new enrollees. roughly another 4 million people would qualify in the remaining states, according to a 2018 kaiser report.
i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients. we should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.
justin sullivan via getty images at thursday's democratic debate, vice president joe biden and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) went another round of arguments over medicare for all.
the health sharing groups might not be appealing to a lot of folks if it wasn't for the exemption to obamacare that congress granted the ministries.
farenthold used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit his former communications director, lauren greene, had filed in 2014, politico reported in december. greene accused farenthold of telling her he had sexual fantasies and wet dreams about her, and then claimed she was fired after complaining to farenthold.
the most blatant were a series of funding cuts to the advertising of healthcare.gov, the federal website for people buying coverage on their own, as well as to groups that help individuals navigate that process. the most significant attack on the law may have been new regulations that allow insurers to sell short-term plans not subject to the affordable care act's insurance regulations.
courtesy of wayne williams wayne williams, a community college custodian, went to the uva emergency room for a sore throat and came out with a $6,931 bill.
but in 2017, congress understood that the rest of the law would remain in place when it zeroed out the mandate's penalty and did so anyway. democrats have said that's the most relevant indicator of congressional intent, as donald verrilli, the former u.s. solicitor general now representing the u.s. house, argued during his portion of oral argument on tuesday.
one of those is aileen peters, 72, who joined a dayton democratic club in the wake of the election.
jayapal would have a very good sense of support for medicare for all; she's the primary sponsor of the most prominent single-payer bill in congress.
a department of health and human services official told a senate committee tuesday that the administration is considering how it could pay hospitals to treat uninsured coronavirus, or covid-19, patients. and republicans in congress ― some of whom have spent their entire political careers railing against obamacare and socialized medicine ― are sounding supportive of the idea.
we thought this was only a respiratory virus. turns out, it goes after the pancreas. it goes after the heart. it goes after the liver, the brain, the kidney and other organs. we didn't appreciate that in the beginning, dr. eric topol, a cardiologist and director of the scripps research translational institute, told reuters.
biden's strategy of appealing to virtually everyone just might work in the short term, as kevin robillard wrote for huffpost. why? the majority of biden's backers are supporting him because they want trump gone. democrats just need to keep dissent on either side of the tent at bay until november.
some of those stories highlighted people with preexisting conditions who gained coverage for the first time or who could finally afford private insurance thanks to the law's subsidies. others got coverage because the 2014 medicaid expansion made the program available to more adults with low incomes. others focused on the failures and shortcomings of the affordable care act and the private health insurance system that serves as its foundation.
i'm hopeful. i'm hopeful they understand the predicament they've created. they can't close the government again, reid said, referring to the last time the government shut down over gop riders targeting obamacare.

since the obamacare law went into effect in 2010, it's estimated the number of people in the united states enrolled in health cost sharing plans has more than doubled from 200,000 to 530,000.
the exchange on wednesday's broadcast of outfront began when burnett asked murtaugh if the health plan trump touted during his disastrous town hall with abc news tuesday was real or just an empty campaign promise.
the democrats haven't had this leadership since obama left the white house, and this absence has left many of us unsure how to fight against the darkness. without a better direction, many of us resorted to lashing out in ways we knew weren't kind or productive.
perdue has faced a tough, well-funded battle by his democratic challenger. over the last three months of the campaign, ossoff brought in more than $21 million, the largest quarterly fundraising figure for a senate race in georgia history. perdue raised about $5.6 million during that period.
in a post-roe world there would be other choices for a woman like santoro. the obvious difference is that now, unlike in the 1960s, we have safe and effective medications that can be made available outside the medical system, grossman says. it is much harder to crack down on these medications, which are safe, effective, heat stable, easily transportable, and available in many countries without a prescription.
i talked with the president and the secretary of health and human services ― i've explained to them how the senate and house works, mcconnell told reporters. the conference report is not amendable. what democrats are trying to do will not achieve an outcome.
cultural and legal changes in the years since roe, however, had muddled the question of criminality long before trump's statement. paltrow, whose group defends pregnant women caught in the legal system, points out that there is a kind of truth to the claim that few women were arrested before roe, but that's only because few women were arrested for any crime.
mandel ngan via getty images josh hawley, a republican senate candidate in missouri, doesn't put president donald trump in his ads about health care. but, like trump, he has endorsed legislation and lawsuits that would strip protections from people with pre-existing conditions.
anyone can chime in when a federal agency requests public comment on a proposed rule, though agencies especially consider expert opinions from think tanks and the like. but that doesn't mean the administration is going to listen to the responses it doesn't like.
a lot of people with preexisting conditions, they're given a stigma i don't think they deserve, he said. they're branded for life with the preexisting conditions thing. if not for the aca, it'll put them into a category where they might not be able to afford care at all.
mekelburg also swooned over racist figures such as former breitbart news editor milo yiannopolous and youtuber stefan molyneux and hyped white nationalist groups such as soldiers of odin, proud boys and generation identity. she vilified quarterback colin kaepernick for taking a knee, called black lives matter a terrorist group and made light of police violence against black men. she tweeted white supremacist lies about black rape statistics:
he's done a lot in terms of growing our economy and making our quality of life better. and we are now the world's leading producer of petroleum, because of fracking, leakes said. he praised trump for the decline in gas prices in recent years, as well as the unemployment rate.
collins must perceive herself as being in a tough spot with this vote. from her perspective, the biggest threat to her job right now is not the pressure campaign being mounted by reproductive rights groups in maine but a competitive primary challenge from her right in 2020. and she has already infuriated maine republicans by crossing the aisle to protect obamacare's individual mandate, never mind that she subsequently voted for a tax bill to which republicans attached provisions repealing the mandate.
one more time: if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. a senior advisor to president-elect donald trump said tuesday that after obamacare is repealed and replaced with different health-care law no one who has health insurance would lose their coverage. that is correct. we don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance, the advisor, kellyanne conway, said on msnbc's morning joe.
of course, with republicans still deeply divided on how to proceed, this proposal would be just an opening bid. some conservatives in the house and senate don't even want to replace the affordable care act, while another, larger faction objects to providing financial assistance at all and has sneered at proposals that include tax credits, calling them obamacare-lite.
while trump's bill also lowered income taxes for the average middle-class family, his changes to income tax rates — unlike his changes to corporate tax rates — are due to expire at the end of 2025. and he eschewed proposals that would have made the tax code less tilted toward rich people, such as ending the loophole that allows corporations to defer taxes on profits amassed overseas, expanding the earned income tax credit for families with low incomes and taxing capital gains at the same rates as ordinary income.
anderson warned that some insurers may decide that the aca market is not worth the stress and walk away. but, like leida and every other expert processing the news on saturday, he said the consequences depend on just how quickly the administration resolves the situation.
under an earlier version of the proposal, the average monthly savings would have been around $10 at lower incomes and $100 at higher incomes, according to official estimates. for the small group of consumers facing the biggest sticker shock today, the savings would have been much bigger, literally hundreds of dollars a month.
mcgrath made efforts to appeal to booker's supporters as she declared victory.
before the 1970s, abortion was not the cultural divide that it has since become. when the new york state assembly passed its legalization measure, the vote was 76 to 73, with 46 democrats and 30 republicans voting yes and 24 democrats and 49 republicans voting no.
that's what pfeifer will never forget.
typically after an election, carisa lopez notices that people just want to take a deep breath and relax before mobilizing again. but not this time.
the plaintiffs filed their suit in u.s. district court in fort worth, texas, where they knew they would get a conservative jurist ― and where they drew reed o'connor, a george w. bush nominee.
the major cause for the delay is to avoid the political consequences and pain of unwinding expansion, especially in republican-held states with upcoming gubernatorial contests. this also prevents state budgets from incurring major new costs with little runway. like sgr, the future reduction is premised on a future congress being willing to endure the political pressure of letting spending cuts go into effect. it is unlikely that any future congress will have a stronger political will in terms of reforming obamacare entitlements than the sitting congress – thus it is unlikely that the expansion repeal will ever be implemented in reality.

no crowds meant more freedom to cross the aisle
yoho, one of the most anti-obamacare lawmakers in congress, said it would be a wise thing for the government to pay for testing and treatment of the uninsured, while also saying he's not ok with socialized medicine.
it's hard to say how people would feel about this. employers can already raise copayments or deductibles, alter provider networks, and switch carriers altogether. but people don't seem to feel as skittish about that possibility as they do about the government forcing them to change.
in a nutshell, the more sick people and the fewer healthy people a private for-profit insurer attracts, the less competitive that insurer becomes relative to other insurers that don't attract as high a percentage of the sick but a higher percentage of the healthy.
we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this, harris shot back, echoing a line from sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) in a similar exchange on health care in tuesday's debate.

the comments were obviously made in jest, but what's not a joke is the harm obamacare has caused for countless utahns, whitlock told kstu.
the victory for republicans finally closes the chapter on democrat rule in frankfort, u.s. rep. thomas massie, a republican, declared that evening. this is literally the last nail in their coffin.
the white house attack on its efficacy follows similar evidence-free assertions ― that millions voted illegally in the november elections, for example, or that obama wire tapped trump at his midtown manhattan headquarters.
in reality, ministries were something of an afterthought during the drafting of the affordable care act, as laura santhanam recounted in a recent article for pbs frontline. ministries had existed as formal, incorporated arrangements only since the 1980s, and two decades later they were still serving a tiny community of people joined mostly by faith.
kasich's speech, for instance, would not have gone well with the ohio delegation ― many of whom fought the republican for decades ― drowning him out. even a figure as broadly respected as former secretary of state colin powell would have drawn a negative response. and the speech from former new york mayor michael bloomberg, who is widely seen within the party as having stiffed his campaign workers, would have drawn bronx cheers from essentially every delegate or convention-goer affiliated with organized labor.
trump's reported concern about biden becoming his democratic rival in the 2020 election led to the ukraine scandal, over which the house impeached the president last month.
specifically, trump's budget proposed a small trim to social security ― an estimated $30 billion over 10 years, by cutting assistance to some people with disabilities who get money through social security disability insurance ― and a more substantial cut to medicare: about $500 billion over the next decade, mostly through reductions to reimbursements to doctors and hospitals.

special elections for several open house seats and dozens of posts in state legislatures give democrats a chance to capitalize on this excitement long before the 2018 midterm elections.
the credits would be phased out for individuals earning more than $75,000 or couples earning $150,000. the tax credit would be reduced by ten percent of the amount by which an individual's income exceeds the threshold. the advanceable, refundable portion of these credits would be paid directly to insurers, with any excess in credit over premiums eligible to be deposited into an individual's hsa account.
that obviously hurt us last november because it was mischaracterized, but we can do a lot better job of taking care of pre-existing conditions, wicker said.
and while gross wants action to mitigate climate change, he toes a careful line on environmental policy designed to reflect his alaska-first philosophy. he supports opening the arctic national wildlife reserve (anwr) to limited oil and gas drilling, but opposes the dredging of pebble mine, a proposed open-pit gold and copper mine that experts fear would endanger alaska's famously abundant sockeye salmon fisheries. more than 60% of alaskans agree with gross, according to a poll commissioned by bristol bay defense fund, a group opposed to the mine.
i can't offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process, she said during the nearly 12-hour session.
this describes virtually every senate democrat (except for west virginia sen. joe manchin, who voted for kavanaugh) on some of the most consequential votes taken since donald trump became president.
question #5: don't bernie supporters want to see america elect its first female president?
there are strong reasons to think republicans will get that wish. in the huffpost/yougov poll, barely more than a third of americans who opposed the tax bill said they were following its progress very closely. just 13 percent of those opponents named it among the two issues most important to them. overall among opponents, the tax bill ranked seventh on a list of 12 issues. health care ranked first, as it has for much of this year. if that doesn't change, the tax bill's unpopularity may not help its opponents electorally in the way obamacare did — and continues to do.
and when murtaugh simply pivoted to hailing trump's accomplishments and attacking democratic nominee joe biden and his health care policies, burnett summed it up: you don't have a plan.
q: what would the public option do to federal spending?
that helps explain why, even as democrats are preoccupied defending obamacare from gop efforts at repeal, they are also talking about next steps for making health care more affordable to diabetics ― and everybody else.
if he has more than 25 votes that are that way, yes, it's trouble.
the 79-year-old said that his main concern right now is making sure his quality of life isn't compromised. not by plans to address the student loan debt crisis, policies against fracking or monthly $1,000 checks in the mail that would be coming out of his taxes. leakes believes everyone should be self-reliant, as he says he and his family have been for years.
in november 2015, cortez was transferred downstate to the green haven correctional facility in stormville, new york. mekelburg followed him. at the beginning of 2016, she moved to fishkill, about a 15-minute drive from green haven. she and siino by then owned a $1.2 million apartment in greenwich village, but she wanted to be close to cortez. she called him her best friend.
the pocket constitution excited the masses and gave hillary's base something to emotional to hold on to. one of the key issues with hillary's campaign has been her inability to excite and arouse her base. sure, she's emotionally stable and has experience. and the woman thing is kinda cool. but even with the first woman president notion, she's still been unable to excite her base. bernie supporters, who were extremely energized and excited, are lethargically moving towards hillary with the momentum of a sloth. it doesn't help that she comes off as someone who can't connect with her voters on an emotional level.
but another motive for concealment is less obvious: the prospect that trump literally owes his election to russian interference ― and, therefore, that russia's ongoing interference will be similarly helpful to trump republicans this november ― and beyond.
if we're electing bernie sanders, we can get there. rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.)
sued patients for as much as $1 million and as little as $13.91, and garnished thousands of paychecks, largely from workers at lower-pay employers such as walmart, where uva took wages more than 800 times.
the breastfeeding protections apply only to employees who are covered by the fair labor standards act ― the same workers with overtime protections ― while excluding managers, professional employees and whole other categories of workers. that means it is predominantly hourly employees who get the protections; women who earn a regular salary above $23,660 and perform certain job duties are exempt from the law. many white-collar women face the same hurdles to pumping as retail workers, but their struggles wouldn't be found in the labor department's investigations.
there is no republican party, former house speaker john boehner said in april. there is a trump party. the republican party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.
the gap refers to a quirk in how the affordable care act was implemented. as written, the law envisioned a nationwide medicaid expansion for those under 133 percent of poverty, and also made tax credits available to people whose incomes are above the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person.

they are being marketed as an alternative [to regulated insurance], so that suggests they are somewhat equivalent, says karen pollitz, a senior fellow at the henry j. kaiser family foundation. people don't understand what they are buying isn't insurance. it's easy to get lost.
the outside airpower aims to narrow the damage of tipirneni's fundraising lead over lesko. tipirneni has raised $740,000 compared with lesko's $564,000 haul. (former rep. franks is among lesko's high-dollar donors, contributing the maximum of $2,700 allowed from an individual.)
these sorts of price controls and global budgets are what allow systems abroad to control health care costs so much more effectively than the u.s. does, and they are why, on paper, medicare for all could save so much money. but critics have warned that setting prices and then setting them too low could force doctors and hospitals to reduce capacity, causing shortages of care.
there is a method to his madness...
the dance sanders has gone through to embrace filibuster reform ― it was only a few days before that he told huffpost he didn't support it because you can't just simply shove everything through ― hints at how much the vermonter believes widespread public support is necessary to enact real change in washington.
still, breitbart's opposition to the health care bill ― which it has called obamacare lite and obamacare 2.0 ― runs the risk of antagonizing trump, who publicly supports the bill, and administration officials arguing on its behalf.
how americans would feel about this is a big unknown. as employer insurance gets more expensive, employers are passing along some of those higher costs to their workers in the form of higher co-pays and deductibles, to the point where some of the employees struggle to pay bills. and employer coverage often requires dealing with limited networks of doctors and hospitals.
and even that figure understates the potential effect of a ruling against the affordable care act.
agreement on the problem, not the solution
she believes americans don't realize how vulnerable they are under the u.s. health care system, even after the affordable care act.
on wednesday, it was another senator who boldly broke with the republican party by voting to convict trump of abuse of power over his dealings with ukraine.
but there is scant evidence that work requirements encourage people to find employment. if anything, the evidence suggests the opposite ― that medicaid coverage makes it easier for people to find and hold on to jobs, most likely because they don't have to worry about medical problems that would make work difficult.
house democrats seek to block trump's moves to allow states to permit the sale of health insurance products that don't adhere to the affordable care act's rules protecting people with pre-existing conditions and guaranteeing a minimum set of benefits. they also want to undo trump's policy of permitting the sale of short-term health insurance policies lasting up to year ― which also do not adhere to those aca regulations.
she deserved a period of mourning and it seems profoundly unfair that this time which should be about remembering her legacy has to be a time of fear and fighting, said martin.
demko's story reported that hhs was also halting other efforts, as well, including direct emails and automatic phone calls to individuals who had previously registered at healthcare.gov (the government's website for buying insurance) and had yet to get coverage.
trump reacted to his defeat by practically threatening to stand aside and do nothing to address the shortcomings of the law, like rising premiums and declining choices of insurers in some states. the best thing we can do politically speaking is let obamacare explode, he said at the white house friday. he made a similar statement on twitter the next day.
and that's the great news: because we're probably years away from looking at what's going to be considered, we have time to mold it, we have time to shape it.
durbin has said repeatedly that if the republicans take repeal off the table, he will pull up a chair, said his spokesman, ben marter.
i do not support taxpayer-funded paying of abortion, reed said, prompting boos. a woman in the front of the crowd immediately fact-checked his remark.
i have met the men and women of michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, indiana, new hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta. for years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. but no one ever tried ― until now.
changes who gets financial assistance, and how much. people who buy private coverage would be eligible for fixed tax credits that vary only by age, starting at $2,000 a year for people who are younger than 30, and peaking at $4,000 a year for people who are older than 60 ― with tax credits phasing out for single people earning more than $75,000 and married couples earning twice that. this would replace the affordable care act's tax credits, which are bigger for people with lower incomes and higher insurance costs. it would be a net transfer of federal resources from the old and the less affluent to the young and the more affluent ― and it's a big reason that, according to several studies, such a scheme would lead to millions of newly uninsured. (also, the value of the tax credits would probably not keep up with the cost of health insurance from year to year, so they would provide less assistance over time.)
that sounds a lot like the kind of plan that sanders and warren promise ― which is to say, it sounds a lot like a plan that would work out well for most americans.
in colorado, gov. jared polis signed a red flag gun law, an extreme risk protection order that will go into effect in january 2020. red flag laws allow judges to temporarily ban individuals from buying or owning guns if they receive a request from family members or law enforcement.
a 2016 survey of 2,401 veterans, found 75 percent want to participate in veterans choice. their primary reasons include shorter distance to travel for care (26.8 percent), avoid wait times (24.5 percent), and quality of care (24 percent).
is it any wonder this congress doesn't reflect your values and your priorities? obama can be heard asking.
over the years, republicans attacked obamacare for sticking people with high deductibles and premiums they could not afford. they promised to deliver better coverage ― offering the same obamacare goodies, like protection for people with pre-existing conditions, without the unpleasant stuff like the individual mandate.
that doesn't sound like news, until you consider which think tank it is ― and exactly what it's proposing.
medicaid eligibility is based on an applicant's income the month she applies, but the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits that congress approved this year won't count toward eligibility, and neither did the $1,200 tax credit most americans should receive this year as part of that stimulus law.
maybe this is the thing that forces republicans to come up with a consensus idea of what to do, but we've been down this path numerous times without any success on an agreement, sen. jerry moran (r-kan.) said wednesday when asked about the latest legal challenge to the law.
slavitt maintained that the group was not beholden to anyone. to that end, he said, it would not take money from insurance companies, for-profit corporations or political action committees.
of some 28 million uninsured americans before the pandemic, the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation estimates, more than 16 million were eligible for some form of subsidized coverage through the health law.
come 2019, the number of people without health insurance will rise by nearly 5 million, while millions more will enroll in short-term plans, according to urban institute research released monday. the study is the first serious effort to assess the combined effects of several major health policy changes that president donald trump and his allies have made over the past year.
then there was the time congress passed a bill with mccain's name on it.

before she even began her run for president, warren introduced legislation last fall she hyped as the biggest anti-corruption measure since watergate. it would impose a lifetime lobbying ban on cabinet secretaries and members of congress, delay congressional staffers from taking lobbying jobs for at least six years and change the federal rulemaking process to restrict business interest groups' ability to delay or influence regulations.
this case represents the latest attempt by the far-right ideologues to do what they repeatedly failed to do for a long time in the courts, the congress, the court of public opinion for the last decade: to eliminate the entirety of the affordable care act, biden said during a press conference in wilmington, delaware.
diaz-balart voted to repeal obamacare in the gop's failed attempt last year, which, in addition to his support for trump, put him on shaky ground. health care, a key issue in the race, is an issue a majority of those in the district have said in polls a democrat would better handle.
the affordable care act guarantees coverage for people with pre-existing conditions with a multi-pronged strategy.
but he added the sense he got from the speaker about giving more power to states, is that ryan would like to see them implement block grants.
wellrithms calculated that a commercial insurance company would have paid $992 for the care williams received, which would have covered costs and generated a profit.

dan a. smith, a professor at the university of florida who specializes in elections, ascribes canova's success to discontent with wasserman schultz's tenure as dnc chair. there are many democrats across the country who are infuriated with debbie wasserman schultz, smith said.
researchers at the henry j. kaiser family foundation looked exclusively at the premium tax credits and how they'd affect different groups of people. the results were predictably complex, with lots of variation from person to person, but the general pattern was clear. lower income and older people and those who live in high-premium communities tend to get less help, larry levitt, senior vice president at kaiser, told the huffington post. those who are higher income and younger and live in low-premium areas tend to do better.
graham's saving grace may be the installation of supreme court justice amy coney barrett, a protege of the late justice antonin scalia whose confirmation on monday sealed a 6-3 conservative majority for decades. his campaign is banking on his role in the judicial fight to help turn out socially conservative and evangelical voters and deliver him a fourth term.
and while obama promised as a candidate to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement only to ignore the matter as president, trump actually reopened the accord in an effort to boost u.s. manufacturing. the modified agreement, the u.s.-mexico-canada free trade agreement, won the endorsement of the afl-cio, the country's largest federation of labor unions, and house democrats, who voted to enact the deal in december.
he took to the floor moments later urging republicans to work with democrats to pursue a different option.
crudely speaking, the harris plan calls for a more sweeping transformation than the reforms supported by former vice president joe biden. but it would stop short of the change to wholly government-run insurance that sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) has championed.
but at what point do progressives start taking pelosi's shots personally? when do her efforts to protect vulnerable democrats from a truly liberal agenda become a problem? and when are progressives going to demand more from their leadership than some placating hearings or a toothless select committee?

that populist-lite approach can at times prove an awkward fit for the son of a former governor with a prestigious law degree, and beshear's attempts to paint himself as a bluegrass everyman have drawn mocking responses from bevin. you love public education so much that your kids go to private school, the governor said at a recent debate in a testy exchange that ended with bevin calling beshear a fraud.
the more incremental plans also envision the federal government negotiating over drug prices directly with manufacturers and setting limits on what doctors and hospitals can charge patients even when they are not part of private insurance networks. that last part is important, because it would mean government is regulating health care prices, which is what medicare for all would also do.
dozens of studies over the past six years, or even the full decade really, on the affordable care act have shown that ... the net effects are really positive, benjamin sommers, a harvard economist who conducted some of the most definitive research, said in an interview. people can afford their care. people get better preventive care, more chronic disease care. they feel better and they live longer.
another committee chairman who plans to hold a hearing on medicare for all, house budget committee chairman john yarmuth (d-ky.), agreed the first step for democrats was to defend the aca. there's tons of questions to answer before you could ever get to consideration of a bill in a committee, yarmuth said of the medicare for all proposal. he said his committee was taking the first steps in just determining what questions need to be answered, but he absolutely thought pelosi's aca fixes were needed immediately.
breitbart news has noticeably blamed ryan for any problems with the republican bill to replace obamacare, known as the american health care act. the site has portrayed the bill as part of an effort by the speaker to mislead the president into supporting legislation that betrays conservative principles.
#3: focus on common ground over partisan framing.
will we preserve the rule of law and america's constitutional democracy, or further empower an aspiring autocrat to undermine them both? will we demand accountability for russia's malevolent attacks on our elections, or protect the malefactors at home and abroad?
biden, leading in virtually all polls, has held himself out as a union man throughout his decades-long political career. nonetheless, he was asked about the failure of democrats and the obama white house to pass card check legislation during obama's first term. the missed opportunity still rankles labor activists who feel the law too easily allows employers to disrupt organizing campaigns.
you're not only going to have sen. sanders winning the white house, faiz shakir, sanders' campaign manager, told thousands of supporters who gathered at house parties in april. my friends, you are going to see a wave — a wave up and down the democratic ballot. that is what we are fighting for.
mcauliffe said that house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) disclosed few details about the gop replacement for obamacare in his meeting with governors earlier on wednesday.

house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) slammed the justice department's brief, saying it would rip away health care protections in the dead of night and in the middle of a pandemic.
the republican party will soon be known as the 'party of health care,' the president told reporters without elaborating moments before meeting with gop senators on capitol hill. he did not specify what, if any, legislation he would like to see brought to his desk, according to gop senators who attended the lunch.
blue and red states continue to move in opposite directions on health care.
this is still a far cry from full repeal of the affordable care act, which is what trump and the republicans tried to pass last year. but it represents a significant reversal of the changes that the 2010 health care law unleashed.
the trump administration's indefensible assault on americans' health care in the courts continues to threaten catastrophe in the lives of families across the country, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said in a press release. we will continue our fight in the courts and in the congress to defend and strengthen affordable health care for all americans.

what sanders said, and didn't say, about his critics
in medicaid, you are going to knock all these people off after 2020, which is just a few years away, he said.
they are saying that it's not the prerogative of a federal district court just to completely rewrite or jettison laws ― the courts should focus on making as narrow a decision as possible, timothy jost, professor emeritus at washington and lee university and longtime defender of the law, told huffpost. it gives the conservatives a way to rule against this. even if the panel ends up with three trump appointees, it gives them a very strong escape route, if they want to claim the originalists' approach.
as long as that hypothetical agent didn't need a lot of medical care, he or she would end up saving money. but one who had medical conditions or developed them would end up paying more, because ahps wouldn't cover medical bills as completely. meanwhile, the more comprehensive plans available through healthcare.gov would be getting more and more expensive, because they'd be attracting a sicker group of enrollees.

president trump: well, we're going― we're going look. we also have― assets that we've never had. i mean we've never had growth like this. we never had a consumer that was taking in, through― different means, over $10,000 a family. we never had the kind of― the kind of things that we have. look, our country is the hottest in the world. we have the hottest economy in the world. we have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. african american, asian american. hispanics are doing so incredibly. best they've ever done. black. best they've ever done. african american. the numbers are incredible. the poverty numbers. the unemployment and the employment. there's― there is a difference, actually. but the unemployment and employment numbers for african americans are the best we've ever had. you know, we just― came up with a chart, and it was a very important to number to me. african american youth has the highest, by far, unemployment. the best unemployment numbers that they've ever had. and the best employment numbers. right now we have almost 160 million people working in the united states, and we've never even been close to that, joe.
the nyha doesn't actually specify what the plan would pay doctors and hospitals, so rand researchers had to make some assumptions. they figured that, at the outset, health providers would be paid at rates that matched the average of what all the different payers in new york (medicaid, private insurance, etc.) pay now. but over time, rand researchers assumed, the new system would aggressively limit year-to-year inflation, imposing the kind of cost discipline that does not exist now.
medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, indian health service reforms, the medicaid expansion, fda authority over generic biologics — all would fall by the wayside, he said.
liberal think tanks are likewise putting new muscle into policy proposals. the center for american progress in february released a plan that would also create a medicare-like government program. it's the most ambitious proposal the center has released since back in 2008, when it was writing white papers destined to become blueprints for the obama administration.
mcsally, who was also running for the senate back then, spent the next year denying she'd tried to gut preexisting condition protections. voters saw through the lie, with a little help from the media, and that's one reason she ended up losing her 2018 race. the state's governor ended up appointing her to fill the state's other seat, which was vacant, and she's now running in a special election for the remaining two years on the term.
what this means for the health care debate
collins said this week that she believes trump learned a big lesson from the impeachment trial and suggested he will be more cautious about potentially seeking foreign interference in the future. (she later said it may have been more accurate for her to say she hopes trump learned a lesson.)
do you think antitrust is a part of that toolkit? because people look at how concentrated the drug industry, the hospital industry, the insurance industry are, and they say that that is one of the key drivers of costs.
while policy experts like hempstead are taking note, it's unclear how uninsured americans will respond. former president barack obama's health law has been on the books over a decade, but surveys consistently show that many people lacking job-based insurance do not realize they may qualify. the congressional budget office estimates that about 33 million people are uninsured this year.
sen. chris coons (d-del.) asked whether the president could fire at will a prosecutor who is criminally prosecuting him, citing a past opinion of kavanaugh's.
although memories of exactly what biden said and why have grown fuzzy, one former official recalled a roosevelt room meeting in early 2009 in which biden made a strident 10-minute argument. it was very, very strongly phrased and very long, and i have heard very few things like it over the years, the former official said, adding that it would be fair to call it a tirade.

we're trying to find consensus among ourselves and at the same time reach out to some democrats who would be open-minded to the solutions being at the state level, not necessarily in washington, graham said wednesday.
the measure tuesday night needed 60 votes because of the inclusion of two amendments: an unscored proposal from rob portman (r-ohio) that would offer some assistance to people who lose medicaid coverage, and the so-called cruz amendment ― which would allow insurers to offer plans that don't comply with obamacare regulations as long as they offer at least one plan that does. the senate parliamentarian has not ruled whether cruz's proposal conforms with rules for the budget reconciliation process, which allows the chamber to fast-track certain measures. if the parliamentarian finds that cruz's amendment should be subject to 60 votes, it could be difficult for a final piece of legislation to address the issue as well.
the correct answer would have been yes. here is how the exchange went instead:
in the fraught environment of the the health care law, spicer and other republicans are arguing that the cbo's weakness on this topic was proven by its projections about the affordable care act that turned out wrong.
trump had previously supported clinton's presidential candidacy and supported her during her time as a new york senator. trump interviewed with fox and friends on july 15, 2015 where he admitted to past contributions to clinton's campaign, i'm a businessman, i contribute to everybody ... that's part of the problem with the system, trump said nearly six months ago. he defended his contribution and downplayed it after suspicions from the gop of a liberal mole.
so, in over five seasons of math questions, for example, mulvaneym's score was 19 percentage points worse than the average user. in all categories combined, mulvaneym's average score was 8 percentage points worse. to his credit, he does have the average user beat in business and econ questions by about 16 percent — a ringing endorsement of our president's budget chief.
president trump: at some point they will be. we have tremendous growth. we're going to have tremendous growth. this next year i― it'll be toward the end of the year. the growth is going to be incredible. and at the right time, we will take a look at that. you know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look, cause it's such a―
but this wouldn't affect only people with histories of serious or chronic illnesses, such as cancer or diabetes. women who have experienced postpartum depression or underwent caesarean sections could be tagged as having pre-existing conditions. a high school sports injury or adolescent acne could even be enough for an insurance company to deny coverage or jack up rates.
your doj just submitted a brief in support of taking away health care coverage for 30 million americans. pic.twitter.com/n2h7p64ulq — senator bob casey (@senbobcasey) march 26, 2019
he was also highly critical of the plan to unwind the obamacare expansion, which brought coverage to millions of people in the 31 states that took advantage of it. kasich wondered what would happen to all the people who wouldn't have had coverage if not for the expansion.
to be clear, rights don't have to change. language has to change. we need to stop making support of the most ideological expression of our beliefs a condition of allyship. for someone to be wary of terms like pro-choice or feminism because of their experiences isn't necessarily proof of secret misogyny. if we root our discussions in our mutual commitment to fairness and empathy, and if we approach questions about particulars from that shared plane, we just might find ourselves on the same side.
but with a favorable senate map that includes many more vulnerable democrats than republicans, a gerrymandered house that democrats would probably have to win by seven or eight points in the popular vote to take back the majority, and voter suppression efforts holding down democratic turnout in key states, the republicans might be making a savvy bet. or at least the best one they can.
the states' argument goes like this: the mandate was legal as a tax, but it's not a tax ― or constitutional― now that there isn't a penalty (aha, take that, john roberts!). but it goes further: because the obama administration argued in 2012 that the court couldn't invalidate the mandate without blowing up the whole law, the court should blow up the whole law now that there are no fines and there shouldn't be a mandate (aha, take that, barack obama!).
with medicare and social security largely off the table, trump has instead focused on medicaid, which provides care to more than 70 million poor and disabled people. president barack obama successfully expanded medicaid when passing the affordable care act a decade ago, but trump has endorsed gop plans — they failed spectacularly in the senate two years ago — to dramatically curb the program.
don't get me wrong: i also vent about trump. but i know the utility of doing so is purely negative at this point. not only will it not win anyone over, it'll push most further away. the problem at this point is relational, not informational. and the only way to solve that particular problem is to take a step of reconciliation towards our neighbors, using grace to pierce those narratives which hateful men have sold them about us being on different sides.
in most cases, medicaid and chip programs don't charge premiums for children or adults (though some states do), and these programs typically require only small cost-sharing like copayments.
conservatives are playing identity politics with barrett, selling the idea that one woman is interchangeable with any other woman. that any woman who gets to the top is a win for women.

with only about 31,000 registered voters in the district, that means they'll be hitting voters repeatedly.
in a previous challenge to the affordable care act, the supreme court had upheld the mandate as a legitimate use of congressional power to tax. if the penalty is zero, the lawsuit claims, then the mandate can't be a tax, rendering it unconstitutional.

but we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
with over 23 million residents, what self-governing state is the most populous such entity, by far, that is not a member of the united nations? from 2004 until 2010, it was home to the world's tallest building. (taiwan/republic of china)
but if the swelling ranks of county-level meetings are an indication of things to come, the grassroots movement underway already has a name. it's called the democratic party.
here's the problem i have with the affordable healthcare act. number one, there is a provision in there that anyone over the age of 74 has to go before what is effectively a death panel, he said, prompting immediate screams and boos from the audience. yes they do, yes they do, it's in there folks.
although the house speaker agreed to allow medicare for all supporters to hold hearings on the issue this year, it's notable that they are not scheduled for any of the committees with jurisdiction over federal health care programs, and pelosi herself has expressed skepticism about the feasibility of single-payer.
mckinsey & co. ran a rough analysis on the leaked house bill, and presented its findings to a meeting of the nation's governors over the weekend. some presently uninsured young people would get coverage, mckinsey's analysts predicted, because the gop's tax credits would make insurance more financially attractive. but those gains would be more than offset by older people dropping insurance as it suddenly became a lot more expensive. overall, mckinsey's researchers said, non-group insurance ― that is, coverage for people buying on their own ― would decline by 30 percent to 50 percent.
in texas, expansion would make 1.2 million more people eligible for medicaid, according to a 2018 kaiser family foundation analysis. an urban institute study in 2014 estimated that not expanding medicaid would deprive texas hospitals of $34.3 billion in federal reimbursements over 10 years.
the thing is, the least able will have a little bit more money so that they can pay their electricity bill. they have a little bit more money so they can splurge at the grocery store, cooper said. but what they won't do is generate wholesale job creation.
for example, decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. while we followed the agreement to the letter, russia repeatedly violated its terms. that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, or inf treaty.
do we want to continue moving forward, continue the progress we've made, and keep fighting to make things better--or do we turn the keys over to donald trump? that's what this election is about.
mr. vice president, you can't have it both ways, booker said, referring to biden's (and obama's) record on immigration (during their two terms, a record number of immigrants were deported). you invoke president obama more than anybody in this campaign. you can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.
trump, for his part, attacked mccain for his vote to kill an obamacare repeal bill in the senate and famously criticized him for being captured while serving as a pilot in vietnam. i like people who weren't captured, he said in the early stages of his presidential bid.
rep. greg gianforte (r) ― famous for losing his temper and body-slamming a journalist ― is running for governor. democrat kathleen williams, a former state legislator, is running for his vacant congressional seat a second time against republican state auditor matt rosendale. polls are showing a close race, as rosendale ties himself to trump and williams tries to cast herself as an independent. a new york times siena college poll showed williams trailing rosendale 50% to 46%.

discussing what sort of leadership qualities he looks for in a candidate, moulton, an iraq war veteran who unseated incumbent democrat john tierney in 2014, spoke of cooperativeness and bipartisanship, of politicians floating above the fray.
that put the argument over medicare for all into a very different context ― or, at least, it should have.
but then the back-and-forth started, and accuracy went out the window. in response to a harris attack, biden said his plan will cover everyone. it wouldn't. in response to biden accusations that her plan's expense would blow up in the second decade and end existing employer plans, harris said those charges were inaccurate. but they were accurate.
if it's an infrastructure bill disguised as a tax bill, it's not going to go, house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) told reporters at a roundtable on tuesday. that is to say, 'you, mr. big bucks, we're gonna give you tax breaks to build something, which you would then own. then you're going to charge tolls, so the taxpayer is paying twice and you're making a profit.' that is not going to fly.
when huffpost interviewed jared blitz in 2015, he was facing double anxiety over the supreme court ruling to make his health insurance more expensive and planning ahead for a major heart procedure he needed to stay alive. without coverage, it would have cost at least $200,000.
himmelstein, du, woolhandler, s. the post-launch problem: the affordable care act's persistently high administrative costs. health affairs blog, may 27, 2015.
throw in the fact that price's proposal, like all republican plans, would dramatically cut funding for medicaid, which provides insurance to millions of low-income americans, and the result would be more crippling medical bills for the american public, not fewer.
it's important to distinguish between actual support for pre-existing condition protections and lip service, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university's center for health insurance reform, told huffpost recently.
today the health care debate inside the democratic party has shifted pretty dramatically. on one end are advocates for a single-payer, medicare for all system. on the other end are those who prefer much narrower, more incremental measures. biden has indicated he supports creating a new government-run plan and giving people a choice of whether to enroll in it, which could put him anywhere in between those poles, depending on the details of what (if anything) he ends up proposing.
attorneys representing 20 republican state officials on wednesday will walk into court and ask a federal district judge to invalidate the affordable care act ― a move that could unleash chaos on insurance markets and, eventually, leave an estimated 17 million americans without coverage.
there's one thing that they really underestimated when people were skeptical of this campaign ― and this is something that we saw early on. they underestimated how much hope people have all over this state, luke mayville said. to have hope, victory doesn't have to be certain. it doesn't even have to be probable. to have hope, victory just has to be possible, and it has to be a victory that's worth fighting for.
i grew up in a household that was very conservative, but not even like religious conservative, but just black conservative, which i think is very different, harrington, who was born in the small suburb of irmo, south carolina, told huffpost. my mom's a dino, so she's democrat but in name only. everything else conservative. my dad, republican.
unlike other areas of economic policy where trump jettisoned promises to break with republican orthodoxy, he has pursued a more nationalistic approach to trade. he immediately withdrew the united states from the trans-pacific partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement negotiated by former president barack obama over the objections of labor unions and a host of other liberal groups. trump also stacked his administration with trade hawks such as robert lighthizer, peter navarro and wilbur ross.
in new york, gov. andrew cuomo (d) signed a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for drivers licenses, an issue that previous governors failed to get passed.
obama officials also decided that short-term plans wouldn't count toward the individual mandate, meaning that people who bought those plans would owe a financial penalty for not having comprehensive coverage.
what? i clicked. cute guy. no pictures of guns and only one on a boat with a dead fish. in the realm of online profiles near me, this made him a screaming liberal. he must be joking, i decided.
the reality of the situation is that republicans really don't have much to say about health care at this point, said geoff garin, a democratic pollster who is president of hart research.
for generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. and in recent years, it's been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything, warren told the mostly african american crowd in new york city. i've only served one term in the senate – but i've seen what's happening. we all saw what they did to president obama. i've watched republicans abuse the rules when they're out of power, then turn around and blow off the rules when they're in power.
if [her rivals] take the bait and get immersed in petty attacks on the details while she stays focused on the big-picture ways her plan avoids medical bankruptcy for families, voters will say she won this debate ― just like they did in prior debates where other candidates obsessed over less relevant details, he said.
indiana's 6th district has voted steadily republican since 1983, and mike pence kept the seat for nearly 10 years before becoming the state's governor in 2012.
no issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
a lot of the damage that trump has caused unilaterally or with the help of the gop congress will be difficult or even impossible to undo, even if democrats were to take both the senate and the house, keep control of each chamber for several years, and even win the presidency in 2020.
this is a frequent republican contention, arguing repeal isn't tantamount to abandoning people with pre-existing conditions. but their proposals would still allow insurers to discriminate against people with medical problems ― by, for example, charging higher prices to people with certain conditions or leaving out key benefits, like prescription coverage, that would make plans effectively useless to people who need ongoing treatment.
but enthusiasm for the affordable care act as a whole has never matched support for the preexisting condition protections and the program's other popular features. in fact, for much of the decade since obama signed the law, opponents have slightly outnumbered supporters, according to the henry j. kaiser family foundation's monthly tracking surveys.
the u.s. has more than 2 million cases, and as states have begun to reopen prematurely, they're seeing their case numbers skyrocket.
the rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable americans. according to one estimate, the cost of covid-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.

one thing i do know about this place is it will take whatever time it has, he said. maybe we need something compelling like a decision like this to get everybody to the table and force compromise.
on the gop side, state sen. amanda chase is the only declared candidate. she's a fervent supporter of president donald trump and has decried the liberal, socialistic agenda that has taken control of the capitol. virginia has seen a remarkable shift in recent years, with the former seat of the confederacy turning bluer and more diverse. last year, democrats won control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time in more than two decades.
over the next few years, the two men continued to clash.
in and around detroit, for example, a 40-year-old non-smoker can buy the second-cheapest silver policy, which the law treats as its benchmark, for just $237 a month. (silver policies cover 70 percent of a typical person's medical expenses.) that's almost exactly what it cost to get the second-cheapest silver plan in detroit last year ― and that's without the tax credits, available to people with low to medium incomes, that can make coverage much cheaper or nearly free.
spicer, though, did not mention key assumptions underlying those estimates early in president barack obama's first term. the cbo believed, for example, that states would be eager to set up their own exchanges and to expand medicaid coverage, given that the federal government was paying for nearly all of it.
not sure exactly how this thing works...
some people who today don't buy comprehensive coverage because it's already too expensive will purchase short-term or association plans ― and gain at least some financial protection from medical bills. at the same time, some people who have comprehensive coverage today are likely to see their premiums rise and will have to drop it.
this member said pelosi was actually weakening her hand by keeping members in the dark and negotiating alone with the senate and the administration. because she could go to mcconnell and mnuchin and say, 'look, my members just won't go for it,' this democrat said.
the other women had to settle for the hope that their employer would follow the law next time.
getting into the details might be hard to avoid for warren, though, given the comparisons that the first stage of her plan has drawn to the medicare for all who want it proposal introduced by south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg. warren has promised to use budget reconciliation to pass a new, public health insurance option in her first two years in office and lower the eligibility age of traditional medicare to 50. the heart of buttigieg's plan includes the former feature, though not the latter.
but breitbart news emerged as a force in washington through its sustained attacks on republican establishment. boisterous commenters joined in to label politicians deemed insufficiently conservative as rinos ― republicans in name only. the site boosted trump during the 2016 election as an alternative to the washington establishment, and has long characterized ryan as emblematic of conventional gop politics.
3: how many children does joe biden have?
that decision, by two republican-appointed judges, did not go as far as the district court opinion had. although the judges agreed with o'connor about the mandate's constitutionality, they said he might have been a little hasty in throwing out the whole statute and asked him to think more carefully about whether at least some parts can stay.
in response, republicans are shying away from the law while democrats are making it a core issue in their 2018 strategy.
regional firms and new specialized 'niche' companies that lack a national network are not viable options for the vast majority of national accounts, and they will not ameliorate the anticompetitive effects of this merger, jackson wrote.
the fact that he'd been there without needing anything from me was impressive, but when he finished the night with a rendition of frank sinatra's fly me to the moon, i was all but on the second date with him.
sanders and his ideological allies are relentless in hyping polling data showing the popularity of his ideas, which pundits often dismiss as pie-in-the-sky. sanders' team believes public popularity is essential for legislation, not only to persuade reluctant legislators to pass it, but also to protect from after-the-fact attacks.
several days later, one of those attorneys, who had served more than 20 years at the justice department, submitted his resignation.
slow uptake is intrinsically linked to larger issues around why black msm have higher rates of hiv, experience higher rates of incarceration, lower education, domestic violence, higher unemployment and housing instability, cianciotto says.
campbell and network are controversial among catholics – the group's silence on abortion rights was singled out in vatican report in 2012 that warned of radical feminism influencing american nuns. the group's support of obamacare also broke with the nation's catholic bishops, who opposed the law for funding abortion.
and even in michigan, insurers say, obamacare needs work. the department of health and human services recently announced changes to the law's special enrollment periods, which were designed to make sure people could still get coverage after a major life event but which people may be exploiting in order to buy insurance only after they get sick. michigan's insurers cited these changes as an improvement, but they say the program needs further revisions ― particularly when it comes to a formula under which the plans that have relatively healthy customers subsidize the plans that don't.
savings depend on cuts to doctors and hospitals
on the evening of may 8, 2018, republicans were celebrating loudly. it was the night of the west virginia gop senate primary, and they had managed to block don blankenship, a mining executive convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety standards in relation to a disaster that killed 29 people, from winning the party's nomination to challenge democratic west virginia sen. joe manchin.
but now that congress is back and the ears of democrats are apparently unfilled with calls to cut food stamps, it's republicans who seem more willing to change their position ― or, at least, to make a tactical retreat ahead of the midterm elections.
the debate over health care can seem like an all-or-nothing proposition these days. either you are replacing private insurance with a single, government-run medicare for all program, as sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and his supporters would, or you're not really transforming health care in a way that establishes it as a right rather than a privilege.
but michigan's legislature, where gerrymandering has given conservative republicans extra clout, resisted the expansion for years, even though the former two-term governor, republican rick snyder, was in favor.
america is a better place today than it was when i graduated from college. [snip] i graduated in 1983. new york city, america's largest city, where i lived at the time, had endured a decade marked by crime and deterioration and near bankruptcy. and many cities were in similar shape. our nation had gone through years of economic stagnation, the stranglehold of foreign oil, a recession where unemployment nearly scraped 11 percent. the auto industry was getting its clock cleaned by foreign competition. [snip] since that year -- since the year i graduated -- the poverty rate is down. americans with college degrees, that rate is up. crime rates are down. america's cities have undergone a renaissance. there are more women in the workforce. they're earning more money. we've cut teen pregnancy in half. we've slashed the african american dropout rate by almost 60 percent, and all of you have a computer in your pocket that gives you the world at the touch of a button. in 1983, i was part of fewer than 10 percent of african americans who graduated with a bachelor's degree. today, you're part of the more than 20 percent who will. and more than half of blacks say we're better off than our parents were at our age -- and that our kids will be better off, too.
the bills call for other changes that would affect regulations on insurance, such as the level of coverage that plans must provide. it is not clear such changes fall within the guidelines of a reconciliation rules ― the special legislative process, reserved for fiscal matters, that would allow republicans to pass legislation with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes it normally would take to overcome a democratic filibuster.
gordon qualified for medicaid under the aca's expansion of that program to more low-income adults; 38 states and the district of columbia have participated. i would be extremely terrified if the high court were to overturn the aca, they said. i am lgbtq, so i am very unfortunately used to people debating my rights.
these short-term plans offer significant savings on a monthly basis compared to the comprehensive insurance sold on the exchanges. but that lower price comes with big financial risks.
to qualify for cobra, unemployed people have 60 days to opt in, and there is no break in coverage. cobra participants have 45 days to make their first payment covering the period from the end of employment to that date.
mcgovern, who plans to hold the first hearing ever on medicare for all in his committee, was also on board with addressing immediate concerns over the aca before democrats really push for a single-payer solution ― which mcgovern supports.
republican lawmakers are touting their new healthcare bill as a superior replacement to obamacare. but one of america's most powerful lobbying groups disagrees, which could seriously hinder the bill's passage through congress.
although medi-share said it could not comment on specifics of the lammers' situation because of confidentiality rules, a spokesperson described its internal review procedure as far more personal and generous than many of the standard appeal processes in the healthcare industry.
that puts both obama and many of his longtime advisers in an awkward spot.
democrats were able to bring the measure seeking to overturn the rule change to the floor on wednesday under the congressional review act, which allows congress to pass a resolution invalidating federal regulations after 60 days of being promulgated.
chip somodevilla via getty images health care activist ady barkan, a supporter of medicare for all, will be among those speaking at the democratic national convention that convenes virtually on monday.
at a televised debate with norman, parnell touted his willingness to speak about democrats and republicans needing to talk together, not shout at each other. and he has rejected calls for single-payer health insurance, preferring to fix obamacare, including by automatically enrolling people in health insurance plans on the exchanges.
david turnoy has been involved with the san juan county democratic party for the last five years and was recently elected chair. he said turnout was huge for their meeting in december, and their email list has grown significantly.
so the progressive wing of the democratic party and the potential presidential candidates who claim its mantle have now set their sights on more ambitious reform ideas that they could implement if the party retakes the white house in 2020. these lawmakers and activists maintain that the aca's biggest vulnerabilities are rooted in its relatively conservative attempt to achieve universal coverage within the bounds of the private insurance system.
it's been a long, slow bleed, said fred blavin, a health policy expert at the urban institute.
the only practical step we have at this point is amnesty: an agreement to forgive and forget.
the department of health and human services announced on saturday that it is temporarily suspending a series of payments to insurers that flow through the aca's risk adjustment system. hhs presented the decision as a necessary response to a recent ruling by a federal district court.
it gives the american people a choice and trusts them to set the pace at which our country moves in a better direction on health care. pete buttigieg campaign document
a day after a populist challenger knocked off one of the most powerful democrats in the country, in part for taking too much corporate campaign cash, rep. seth moulton, a moderate liberal who has raised money from bain capital in his capacity as a would-be democratic party kingmaker, convened reporters on wednesday in a conference room just outside capitol hill for an announcement.
hopp said the membership of the ministries nationwide is only 2 percent of the total insurance market, a number too small to affect the industry.
at one point last year, trump went so far as to brag about record sales of health plans his administration authorized. in fact, there were literally none of those plans available for sale.
defending the aca was a priority of progressive lawmakers and activists for much of 2017. their efforts succeeded in scuttling several republican attempts to repeal the law's essential components.
trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get mexico to pay for it. but since taking office, trump has never asked mexico for payment. instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless congress gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.
farenthold declared in december that he would not seek re-election in 2018 after reports emerged that he'd used taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment claims. a few of his gop colleagues urged him to resign over the accusations, which farenthold has repeatedly denied.
even before the coronavirus pandemic infected nearly 5 million americans, public polling showed voters across the country continued to say health care was the most important issue in the 2020 election and showed they continued to trust democrats more than republicans to handle the issue.
i ran on repealing obamacare, paul told reporters wednesday. it doesn't repeal obamacare. it creates a giant obamacare superfund. i can't be for that.
yes, you want cheaper plans, absolutely, cassidy said, per the washington post. unless you have a common risk pool, you end up with policies that don't cover maternity. as best i can tell, women don't get pregnant without sperm.
privatized medicaid follows the same pattern, as illustrated by tennessee medicaid plans, operated by blue cross blueshield of tennessee, unitedhealthcare, and anthem, with their inadequate physician networks, long waits for care, and denials of many treatments, even as these insurers take away new profits. (6)
even his potential opponents acknowledged how hard it would be to defeat him. at a campaign stop last weekend before his loss in the primary to braun, rep. todd rokita said, if you know joe donnelly, you know he's better than evan bayh in a lot of ways, referring to the state's democratic former senator who lost a comeback bid in 2016. he's very retail in what he does, and i mean that in the best way.
tipirneni remains optimistic about her bid, but she also acknowledged the importance of her bid in increasing the democratic party's reach in the state ahead of the november elections. the party's biggest pickup opportunity is likely in the state senate, where republicans currently have a four-seat majority.
there is $175 billion for housing assistance to help eligible people pay rents and mortgages, $25 billion for the struggling postal service, and a 15% increase in food benefits provided under the supplemental nutrition assistance program.
this guy ― he thinks he's running against somebody else, said former vice president biden, who has spent decades burnishing a reputation as a political moderate. he's running against joe biden.
abbott also ordered elective surgeries to be suspended in bexar, dallas, harris and travis counties — which include the cities of san antonio, houston, austin and dallas — to help free up hospital beds.
washington ― in just over a month as speaker, nancy pelosi has deftly navigated democrats through the shutdown and solidified her position atop the house democratic caucus. but at what point does the reluctance of progressives to hit back at pelosi's mounting slights start looking less like sophistication and more like an indication that the resurgent left is soft?
access to affordable health insurance has largely been left out of negotiations between the white house and congress, leaving millions of recently unemployed americans — and previously uninsured americans — in the lurch during a public health crisis. this bill would make treatment for the novel coronavirus free for individuals, as well as open a special enrollment period for previously uninsured individuals to buy into the affordable care act's exchanges.
on health care, she has repeatedly said her past criticisms of chief justice john roberts' ruling allowing health care law to stand was an academic pursuit, and does not delve into the specific legal issues involved in the case coming before the court.
barkan has made clear that he is not giving up on medicare for all. on the contrary, he has said his supporters have two tasks in front of them ― making sure biden beats trump and then making sure biden pursues a progressive agenda.
for years, washington politicians have allowed the pharmaceutical industry, giant insurance companies, and powerful hospital systems to profit off of people when they are at their sickest and most vulnerable, buttigieg said in a prepared statement. my 'medicare for all who want it' plan will create a health care system that puts power in the hands of each american.
the fee itself ― originally two cents on every dollar of assets above $50 million ― is so popular with her base it has become a call-and-response line at her rallies. unlike abolishing private health insurance, it polls high in the broader population as well. and it has baited billionaire financiers and technology executives into lashing out against her ― and in some cases even embarking on quixotic candidacies seemingly designed to blunt her momentum. the increasingly melodramatic hand-wringing of some of these superrich americans has been the silver lining in a cloudy month for the warren campaign.
in 2016, president donald trump defeated democratic rival hillary clinton in the district by 21 percentage points. that same year, the district re-elected franks by an even wider margin, but his main opponent was from the green party, not the democratic party.
what trump and his party of health care have failed to come even close to doing is proposing a credible alternative plan that would achieve anything close to the affordable care act's results. quite the contrary, in fact.
groups like women on web and plan c have interactive websites on which patients can figure out how far along they are in a pregnancy, list any medical issues that might present complications and then seek to have the medication mailed to their home.
but it's also clear that specialties, such as orthopedics, urology, podiatry and cardiology, are an early success for veterans choice in its current form. speeding care for veterans in these specialty areas will likely expand.
but researchers who have followed the affordable care act closely have found that, on the whole, access has clearly improved ― perhaps because critics exaggerate the extent of the problems, and perhaps because even imperfect medicaid or affordable care act plans are superior to having no insurance at all.
a potential opening for a progressive
to be clear, these ideas for knocking down drug prices and expanding insurance coverage are not mutually exclusive. most of the universal coverage and quasi-universal coverage plans that democrats have floated would give the federal government at least some power over pharmaceutical prices.
no one needs to convince me of the urgency to address the issues of equal pay and equal justice, affordable health care for all, real action on voting rights, and ending the corrosive grip that corporate special interests have on our federal government, she said in a statement. but there can be no removal of mitch mcconnell without unity. ... the differences that separate democrats are nothing compared to the chasm that exists between us and the politics and actions of mitch mcconnell.
some ads highlight the ministries' emphasis on faith. in one television spot for medi-share that ran in 2016, families appear interview-style, while soft music plays in the background. you're not only getting taken care of by a medical doctor, one man says to the camera, you're also getting taken care of spiritually, through the power of prayer.
in the report, mueller laid out 10 possible cases in which trump may have obstructed justice. detailing some of those most damning instances — like when trump tried to fire mueller and then instructed then-white house counsel don mcgahn to lie about it — could pack the punch of a viral sound bite and could be what shakes democratic lawmakers from their impeachment torpor.
three career justice department attorneys took their names off the department's brief to the court last week. one of them, a veteran of more than 20 years, quit the day after it was issued. chad readler, the political appointee heading the justice department's civil division, signed off instead, and trump announced his intention to nominate him to the federal appeals court the same day.
but it's not just new parents that need time with their kids.
in the past two weeks, quist has made an issue out of gianforte's murky stance on the republican health care law.
how can someone be injured by a provision without any concrete consequence? she wrote. and how can the mandate be read to compel someone to purchase insurance if the government is admitting that the provision has no consequences?
even before he took the stage, trump made it clear that he wasn't about to throw out his non-playbook by making an announcement to the fraction of people who'd showed up early enough to get into the building on time.
trump's policies, such as they may be, are a disastrous expression of bottled up resentment among the base, a blind lashing out at all they feel besets them. again and again, he offers phony and dangerous prescriptions that betray his complete ignorance of the most basic rudiments of governance, economics, domestic policy, and national security. he caters to racial antagonism, spreading its toxins in the party and the country as a whole. as a man, he is an intellectually vacant and self-obsessed misogynist clearly in the grips of a profound personality disorder which makes him unfit to lead. he is not simply a disgrace to the party, but a product of all that disgraces it.
but while the gop has no official plan to replace the health care law, the president is convinced that he can make repealing it seem appealing.
texas gov. greg abbott (r) pressed pause on his state's phased plan to reopen the economy due to a surge in coronavirus cases that has put great strain on local hospital systems.
maine (whose senator susan collins has expressed misgivings about the gop bill). 14 million is 2.5 times the population of colorado (whose senator cory gardner might think twice about making life harder for the one in five coloradans who are medicaid-dependent).
several democrats in addition to gideon are vying for the chance to unseat collins: former gubernatorial candidate betsy sweet, former google executive ross lejeunesse, attorney bre kidman and travel agent michael bunker. two independent candidates ― attorney tiffany bond and call center worker danielle vanhelsing ― and maine green independent party candidate lisa savage are also running.
either of these approaches would represent a major break with the status quo, in which hospitals have to take whatever the government gives them on medicare and medicaid and other programs, but can then demand higher payments from private insurance. the result is a messy, confusing system where hospitals try to maximize revenue from a mix of private insurance paying more and public programs paying less, with a huge spread between the two.
one postal worker in southern california wasn't given enough breaks and had to sneak pumping sessions in the bathroom. her breasts apparently hurt so badly that she pumped breast milk into the toilet to relieve the pressure. lack of a clean, available space also led her to pump while seated on the locker room floor. her supervisor gave her a seven-day suspension for taking too many breaks. the labor department concluded the discipline amounted to illegal retaliation. the postal service removed it from the employee's record.
tlaib backed down, but later that day, videos surfaced of meadows spreading the racist birther conspiracy theory against president barack obama.
but in spite of those assurances from his staff -- or perhaps because of them -- trump went the extra mile at his rally to make clear to some of his most zealous supporters here in central pennsylvania that he was still the same guy, thrilling his fans and exasperating his detractors in the same manner as always.
meanwhile, those seeking out comprehensive plans because they want or need them will discover those policies have gotten more expensive, thanks to the way short-term plans will affect the rest of the insurance market. some insurance shoppers will have serious, even life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, which will mean their insurance must have a full set of benefits. but those kinds of policies will become more expensive than they can afford.
republican terry branstad, reynolds' predecessor as governor, was another outspoken critic of obamacare. his administration did virtually nothing to promote enrollment, even though, given the state's small size, adding just a few thousand people to the rolls could have made the market more stable. as of 2016, just 20 percent of iowans eligible to get plans through healthcare.gov had signed up, according to figures compiled by the henry j. kaiser family foundation. that was the lowest of any state, well below the national average of 40 percent.
why do we need a pcori or icer anyway? most patients would not want to take a drug if they didn't know it worked, yet we do it all the time. the fda assesses drugs for safety but does not compare one drug to another or look at the cost of a drug. we need organizations that are objective, not dominated by one type of stakeholder or another, and that operate in an open environment where patients can voice their preferences and ask questions.
planned parenthood will be named my little pony academy. mrs. clinton herself will sit on her perch as judge and jury. on an individual case basis, she will decide the health care american women can receive. nicknamed, hillary's right to choose, the program will be rolled out nationally. it will start on bring your child to work day.
pelosi said thursday that democrats would continue to fight to defend and strengthen pre-existing condition protections from congress to the courts.
in 2010, when president barack obama signed the affordable care act, biden famously called it a big fucking deal. although biden's campaign proposal doesn't live up to that standard, it's closer than most people probably realize.
sen. ted cruz (r-texas) said kavanaugh and merrick garland — former president barack obama's 2016 supreme court nominee who never advanced to hearings — were on the same page in the vast majority of decisions both judges participated in on the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit.
they have never mattered to romney as much as his presidential aspirations have. indeed, those stubborn ambitions are so well known that just a day after his washington post op-ed ran, romney sought to clarify he has no plans to primary trump in 2020.
it feels good on the ground in a 2012 way as opposed to a 2016 way in michigan, she said.
more such fights are likely to come. with the trump administration weakening federal restrictions on how states manage their insurance markets, the affordability and quality of health insurance are increasingly in the hands of state officials.
we want to know what you're hearing on the ground from the candidates. if you get any interesting ― or suspicious! ― campaign mailers, robocalls or hear anything else you think we should know about, email us at scoops@huffpost.com.
though obama remains overwhelmingly popular among democrats, an undercurrent of the party's primary contest is the push from some liberal democrats to go far further than his administration in upending the federal health care system or addressing income inequality. sens. bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts have led the charge, calling for more sweeping, systemic change, though neither has explicitly criticized obama by name.
jorjani defended the email by pointing out that he was still a special assistant to zinke at the time and was appointed principal deputy solicitor two months later. he said he was politely reprimanding an employee who was, as he saw it, taking advantage of a trip for what bordered on personal expenses. roddy, he said, responded negatively.
that the billionaire investor would advocate such a measure should help us rethink what really counts as disruption in this economy. that his company would join forces with amazon and jpmorgan chase to create their own health care company should also chasten our expectations of how much the free market can bring about the large-scale change that is truly needed for health care in the united states.
the republicans challenging the affordable care act say the entire law is now invalid because its component parts are so interconnected ― and because that is what congress would have wanted. they base this argument, in part, on the fact that in 2010 congress issued a finding that the mandate was essential for some other parts of the law to work.
the supreme court's conservative majority argued that congress could not constitutionally order people to buy insurance. but chief justice john roberts joined the court's four liberal members to hold the mandate was a valid exercise of congress' tax power.
despite moving ahead with reconciliation, biden and senate democrats are still rhetorically signaling an openness to working with republicans on a relief package. a group of 10 republican senators, including sen. susan collins (r-maine) and mitt romney (r-utah), made a $618 billion counterproposal earlier this week, and met with the president on monday.
kavanaugh declined to weigh in, maintaining that it wouldn't be appropriate for a supreme court nominee to comment on current events or political controversies.
the republican presidential candidate has almost thrown himself onto the ballot, going back to 1988. while in 1988, the real estate tycoon traveled to new hampshire, he did not start a presidential run. then in 2000, he realigned himself with another party, making him ideologically ineligible to run for the republican nomination. in early september 3 2015, the new york native, signed the republican national committee's loyalty pledge, to ensure he would not run as an independent. since then, trump has remained vocal about his political ideas and openly stated his ideas on gun control, abortion and other highly discussed issues. now, trump is in high gear, leading in the majority of iowa polls, and all of the national polls.
but i'd like to hear from them what they think that is, he continued.
but even if the mandate is now unconstitutional, they say, the rest of the affordable care act can stand. and during oral arguments on tuesday, both roberts and kavanaugh made statements suggesting they agree.
attendees loudly booed reed when he said he did not support public funds for planned parenthood.
here is a brief overview of how the system currently works (note: medicaid, medical assistance, and ma all refer to the same program):
but let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that there are trump organization employees who are being hit hard by the obamacare rate increases. believing donald j. trump has any idea about that would require believing that he knows or cares about the personal problems his low-wage workers are experiencing, which, come on.
these races are urban, suburban and rural — they stretch from alaska, to the california foothills, to suburban texas. to win would mean bringing high turnout among african american and latinx voters, getting record numbers of young people to actually go to the ballot box and persuading conservative-leaning voters to switch parties.

the 51-43 vote, which was forced in a rare parliamentary maneuver by senate minority leader chuck schumer (n.y.), is part of an effort by democrats aiming to show that republican claims about supporting protections for preexisting conditions ring hollow. the measure needed 60 votes to advance.
what we do know is that millions of americans could lose their health care if the republicans were successful in their crusade against planned parenthood. every year, planned parenthood serves three million americans -- men and women -- and one in five women will receive care at a planned parenthood clinic in her lifetime. planned parenthood provides nearly 900,000 cervical cancer screenings and breast exams each year. what's more, planned parenthood's family planning services prevents thousands upon thousands of abortions.
at the end of the day our job is to protect the secretary, he wrote.
today, medicaid is an entitlement program, like medicare and social security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. the federal government finances more than half of medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. but states that adopt the healthy adult opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.
another democrat takes up amy mcgrath's mission.
republican leaders' attempts to assuage the freedom caucus by letting states regulate which essential benefits insurance exchange plans had to cover contributed to these defections and likely doomed the bill in the senate.
republicans insist that their plan would reduce premiums, citing the same cbo report they disparage. the part of the story republicans don't tell is why the cbo thinks premiums would go down. it would predominantly be because older and sicker people drop increasingly pricey coverage, and because the market would gravitate toward less generous plans ― in other words, plans with even higher deductibles than the ones republicans have been criticizing all these years. were the republican plan to become law, deductibles for the typical plan would rise by 60 percent to $4,100, according to a henry j. kaiser family foundation analysis that appeared in axios.
you wouldn't know if by asking them about it, though. then, you get blatant, easily debunked lies — from a party that has spent nearly 10 years trying to repeal the law that solved the preexisting conditions problem and never proposed a new way of achieving the same outcome.
about 11.8 million consumers nationwide enrolled in 2018 obamacare exchange plans, according to the u.s. government's centers for medicare and medicaid services. (reporting by brendan pierson in new york; editing by noeleen walder and peter cooney)
what started as a competitive advantage provided by some companies soon became the basic standard americans expected from their employment. that worked well for those with a job. but it also left many americans ― particularly the elderly and the poor ― without coverage, something the private market seemed unwilling to fix.
eventually a manager got on the line and suggested the lammers take advantage of an option the rejection letter had mentioned: filing a formal appeal using medi-share's internal review process. they did, faxing a letter from their family doctor confirming their recollections about the medical history. two weeks ago, the lammers learned that medi-share was reversing its decision. it had approved payment for a balance that had, by that point, reached nearly $75,000.
experts agree that number of uninsured people has risen because of layoffs, perhaps by 5 million to 10 million, but authoritative estimates await government studies due later this year.
president trump sees a chance to fulfill his explicit mission: steal away the vital protections of the aca from countless families that have come to rely on them for their health, their financial security, the lives of those they love, biden said on sunday in his hometown of wilmington, delaware.
2. why are bernie fans so angry at hillary when hillary fans aren't angry at bernie?
but this humanitarian success also underscores the newness and fragility of the remade health insurance market, as a new report issued wednesday by the blue cross blue shield association shows. the customers who flocked to the exchanges are sick and are using a lot of medical care, a trend that could jeopardize obamacare's gains by destabilizing the health insurance system.
we recognize this option is not for everybody, said hopp.
personally, i am more than prepared to set aside my misgivings about hillary and vote for her should she win the democratic nomination, and nearly every bernie supporter i know feels the same. while both democrats and republicans share the trait of relying on the same dodgy, corrupting campaign finance system, it doesn't mean that there are no differences between the parties, and republicans have become so extreme, unhinged, and divorced from reality that those differences are more stark than ever. i also think that a lot of people who now claim that they won't vote for hillary in the general election will find themselves holding their noses and checking her name on the ballot when faced with the reality of a donald trump or ted cruz presidency.
this outburst mirrored a longer wall street journal editorial that appeared at the end of december, but it took trump's amplifications to convince some republicans to take these warnings to heart. as meet the press reported, sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) was urging a cautious approach a day later, saying, i don't think we can just repeal obamacare and say we're going to get the answer two years from now. ... when we repeal obamacare, we need to have the solution in place.
those hit by a major health issue.
the trump administration and several states have been promoting alternatives to obamacare″ coverage from the exchanges that some unemployed people may want to consider, such as short-term policies that can last up to a year.
goodall-witcher hospital is the largest employer in bosque county. our payroll is bigger than the county's entire budget, willmann said. can you imagine what it would do to this county to lose $9 million from the economy a year?
consider this ad: a nurse giving a diagnosis to a white senior. it's bad. he needs treatment. the man frets. i can't pay. i have no coverage. as he sits in fear, show obamacare stats on the screen (patients covered, lives saved). promise we can fix this in congress, together, then flash make america great again and fade to black.
verrilli pointed out that by 2017, congress could see that the affordable care act's new insurance markets would work even without a penalty in place. congress is allowed to learn from empirical experience in the world and adjust its policy choices, verrilli said.
sen. chris murphy (d-conn.) urged people to channel their fears into action.
president obama has already vetoed this bill, which also repealed obamacare for the 62nd time -- another blow to women's health care -- and his veto will be sustained. but we must remain vigilant because we know the republicans will come back again and again to attack planned parenthood, threatening women's access to health care and using inflammatory rhetoric that spurs violence against clinics and providers.
i feel great, one gop leadership aide told the huffington post wednesday night. an aide for house majority whip steve scalise (r-la.) said republicans were looking forward to a good vote.
the ensuing coverage declared clinton's speech a success and panned the gop response from senate majority leader bob dole (kan.). the san jose mercury news praised clinton's conciliatory-sounding speech and criticized dole's sharply partisan response.
along with trying to undo the health care law, trump has publicly stated he wants a justice seated for any disputes arising from the election, and particularly the surge of mail-in ballots expected during the pandemic, as voters prefer to vote by mail.
it ultimately will be less defined by the policy positions, because i think the policy positions it's going to support are going to be very much in line with where the public is. it's going to be successful in changing our track record where most things just aren't seemingly able to get done for one reason or another. [the group] helps them get done, and of course that means in partnership with all of those great advocates out there.
that doesn't mean voters elsewhere felt the same way. especially in states like michigan, trump's attacks on more popular democratic governors addressing the crisis more aggressively may have backfired ― not because voters in those states believed their governors were making all the right decisions, but because they could see their governors taking the threat seriously, listening to the scientists and showing compassion for constituents who were suffering.
associated press writer bill barrow in atlanta contributed to this report.
some found that previously uninsured people who gained coverage because of the affordable care act were less likely to show up at the hospital with advanced, life-threatening versions of conditions like appendicitis and diverticulitis, most likely because they had sought care earlier. others found that pregnant women who got coverage received better prenatal care, with health benefits for them and their babies.
parents may be eligible, but in non-expansion states, eligibility is strictly limited and ranges from just 7% of poverty in texas, or $1,520 a year for a family of three, to 95% of poverty in tennessee, or $20,600.
the anti-obamacare lawsuit is considered weak, even among some conservatives. a group of liberal, conservative, and libertarian legal scholars filed an amicus brief arguing that it would be unlawful for a court to go along with what the conservative states want.
but ultimately wanting to get to a place where everybody has coverage ― the way i think about it is, if my kid was lost in the park and i called the police, they would immediately start searching for him. they wouldn't ask for my insurance card and my co-payment or any of those sorts of things. that's the world that i think most americans believe we need to live in ― where they're not risking their financial security because of health care.
the affordable care act sought to stop those practices by prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, banning annual or lifetime limits on coverage, and mandating full coverage of essential benefits, including mental health care and prescriptions. because these new regulations would make coverage more expensive, the law also made available tax credits that discounted coverage by hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars a year.
all of this is absolutely true. but polls have shown that, in general, people who have coverage are satisfied with it. and support for medicare for all schemes consistently falls when pollsters tell respondents that enrollment in the new plan would be mandatory, even for people who already have employer coverage.
yes, there's plenty of waste and administrative inefficiency, but that couldn't be wrung out of the system overnight, said larry levitt, senior vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation. there is a real risk of delays in care and quality problems if payment rates are cut too much and too fast while coverage is being expanded.
but in many states, republicans opposed to health care expansion, or in some cases opposed to obama personally, worked to block both of those.
wearing a hard hat on plant tours in your district
in that moment, i decided to try the octopus again, as it were... against my meditating, spiritually trained doula, conscious future yoga teacher, this seems icky first instinct.
but this time barkan wasn't making the case for medicare for all, at least not explicitly. he was making the case for biden. and while the former vice president has said he supports universal coverage, he has also said he believes enacting medicare for all would require too dramatic a change ― and too heavy a political lift ― to attempt right away.
but even with those protections in place, insurers can fine-tune benefits or market their plans in ways that will alienate customers likely to run up large medical bills ― and, as a result, reduce profit margins. among the more well-known strategies are constructing networks bereft of specialists and hospitals that attract people with advanced cancer or congenital conditions. plans can also construct formularies less appealing to patients with diabetes, schizophrenia or hiv.
the formula for calculating these tax credits is important. it varies based on income, so that you'll get a bigger tax credit if you make less money. the value also varies depending on how much insurance costs in your area ― in particular, the price of the second-cheapest silver plan, which the law treats as a benchmark. (silver plans, which are less generous than typical employer plans, cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person's medical expenses.)
the conspiracy? donald trump is running for president of the united states only to concede to hillary clinton. former florida gov. jeb accuses trump and former secretary of state hillary clinton in his new ad of having a secret master plan:
over his 20-year career, lynch has been the lead sponsor of five bills that have become law; two establishing post offices, two commemorative, and one to ensure federal employees who are veterans are guaranteed paid medical leave. he's co-sponsored more than 100 others; his record as a democrat is mixed. he's an original co-sponsor of the green new deal, but once called global warming an elitist issue. he has a long record as a self-described anti-abortion democrat — and voted to restrict abortions while in the state legislature — but has changed his tone over the last decade, and votes on party lines.
blue states are expanding the reach of medicaid and building on the aca, while red states are restricting and capping medicaid and exploring ways to scale back insurance regulation. — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) june 10, 2019
uva defended the institution's practices as legally required and necessary to generate positive operating income to invest in medical education, new facilities, research and the latest technology. they point to the virginia debt collection act of 1988, which requires state agencies to aggressively collect money owed.
the resistance to president donald trump has taken a variety of forms, all of them well chronicled by the media. the women's march, which saw some 5 million people take to the streets in a single day, helped fuel the growth of indivisible chapters around the country, and has itself continued organizing meetings and protests since. the groups swing left, flippable and the sister district project are routing people to swing districts where they can be most effective, and groups are forming to challenge democrats in primaries. amid it all, observers and participants alike have wondered what the name is for this nascent movement. the resistance? the opposition?
shealy isn't the only person in south carolina who has been paying attention to steyer. bryant carlos has seen him and his campaign everywhere.
yes, that sounds weird. and it's very different from what happened during a pair of previous legal challenges to the affordable care act. in those cases, conservatives across the country were all in on the effort to strike down the 2010 health care law ― filing briefs, writing op-eds and giving interviews to anybody in the media who would listen.
but biden still had moments in which he appeared uncertain and on the defensive. he often conceded his speaking time under pressure from moderators, unlike the other candidates, and flubbed his closing statement.
next year and the year after, the legislation would result in a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in premiums for people who buy their health insurance on their own instead of getting it from an employer or government program like medicare. starting in 2020, rates would decline and wind up 10 percent lower than they would have been under current law.
association health plans may save some employees and employers money because they offer skimpier benefits, although those savings could be negated if an employee needs care not covered by her plan and has to pay out of pocket.
as for his own health care plan, trump has offered broad statements but few details -- similar to his promises to deport all undocumented immigrants through management.
two other republicans facing reelection joined daines in voting to maintain doj support for the lawsuit: david perdue of georgia and thom tillis of north carolina.
and in a fox news poll taken later that year, 55% of voters said the blame for the swine flu vaccine shortage fell mostly on the companies that made the vaccine, with just 13% primarily blaming the white house.
a plane flew over wilmington, delaware, on thursday afternoon carrying a simple message: joe biden is losing it ― vote trump 2020. it wasn't a new piece of rhetoric. president donald trump's reelection campaign has portrayed biden, again and again, as a doddering old fool who stumbles over words, forgets things and generally is not up to the job of being president.
in a report last year, the united nations warned that world governments must cut global emissions in half over the next 12 years to avoid warming of 1.5 degrees celsius, beyond which climate change is forecast to cause $54 trillion in damages.
i was met with a confused look.
confronted with simmering rebellions from both conservative and moderate republicans in the house, the bid by trump and house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) to repeal and replace obamacare looks increasingly doomed.
the cbo projects that 14 million americans will lose health insurance coverage within a year, by 2018, if the plan as currently proposed by republican leadership is passed.
with america in trouble, perhaps decline, if our extractive elites stopped extracting and started shouldering their fair share of the tax burden, we might see a reversal of fortune.
the kind of insurance obamacare was supposed to eliminate
biden has instead proposed to bolster the affordable care act, or obamacare, by making its financial assistance more generous and extending expanded medicaid coverage for the poor to states that have not expanded it on their own. biden has said he would also seek to create a new government-run insurance program that would be open to everybody but purely optional ― an approach some analysts describe as medicare-for-anybody-who-wants-it.
on friday morning, politico reported on five such gop governors who have been publicly calling on lawmakers to consider keeping the portion of the affordable care act that supports the expansion of medicaid in states that choose to.
newman had to overcome barriers erected by part of her party's establishment. the democratic congressional campaign committee, the official campaign arm for house democrats, last year said it wouldn't do business with political vendors ― such as pollsters, consultants and direct-mail companies ― that did business with candidates challenging party's house members.

initially, the federal government paid 100 percent of the health care costs of the expansion population. the federal share falls to 90 percent in 2020. states will have to make up that difference on their own, a prospect that has kept some states from expanding medicaid.
a three-judge panel of the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals in new orleans, is not expected to decide on tuesday whether to overturn or uphold the ruling by a federal judge in texas last year that the entire aca was unconstitutional.
democratic lawmakers howled their protests. i must say that with the passage of [the bill], we have hit rock bottom. no hearings. no witnesses. no amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. no regular order. no bipartisanship, said then-rep. joe crowley (d-n.y.) during a house ways and means committee markup of a follow-up bill in 2018. the 2017 tax bill, he said, was rammed through this committee and rammed through the house of representatives.
associated press senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vowed this week to restore coverage for people with preexisting conditions should the supreme court uphold the challenge to the affordable care act.
gianforte, 56, founded two successful software companies, including rightnow technologies, which he sold to oracle for $1.5 billion in 2011.
that system stands in marked contrast to what other developed nations built in the 20th century. in western europe, progressive governments created state-run health care systems to care for their citizens as part of the extensive social safety nets developed in the first half of the century. in the u.s., theodore roosevelt's bid for the presidency in 1912 on the progressive party ticket included the first call for a single national health service. but the opportunity died when roosevelt lost the election, in part because his plan had been decried as socialized medicine. that slur would prove incredibly effective at stalling other attempts at health care reform throughout the 20th century.
iowa's started selling its version just last year, following a political battle that looks a lot like the one now taking place in kansas. north carolina's farm bureau had hoped to launch its own plan, but the state legislature just voted down a bill to authorize it.
but battling on is what ginsburg would want. she pointed the way to the fight we need to have, and we're all going to show up for it.
shane scanlon, a spokesman for gianforte's campaign, did not respond to a request for comment on the law's financial benefits for the gop candidate.
they almost pulled it off anyway, after bollier spent primary season building a fundraising advantage over her eventual opponent and drawing national attention to the race from progressive outside groups, which poured money into the contest in october in an effort to flip the seat.
in reality, for each income group, at least some individuals would likely find themselves paying more, not less, once a medicare for all system took effect.
- knife-cutting competitions look like so much fun.
tracy and i are beyond grateful that medi-share has taken the time to listen to our side of the story and re-examine our bills and our situation, danielle said last week, after learning about the decision. the stress of having to figure out how to pay all of these bills out-of-pocket was devastating.
but the hearing comes just two days before house democrats hit the exits for a six-week recess. mueller was initially supposed to testify last week, but the judiciary committee agreed to push it back in order to negotiate for more questioning time.
republicans and democrats agree there are two large groups of swing voters in the state: union workers who make up donnelly's base but voted for trump in 2016 and college-educated suburban voters, mostly women, in the so-called doughnut counties surrounding indianapolis.
huffman added: we are completely emasculated in terms of our ability to have hearings and move the needle in terms of the institution.
sexton still has about $4,000 to go on a bill that he said was more than $30,000 before uva's discount, a fundraising campaign and other payments. he hopes to re-enroll and finish his degree in education next year.

we'd be screwed. we'd be totally screwed, paul said. i would have very few options. at my age, i'm not going to go out and get a job at a big company and get good benefits tomorrow because i got sick ― and then take time off because i need surgery and chemo.
nice use of the parenthetical? this guy paul not only knew what such a thing was, he'd actually read my profile closely enough to find the parentheses. i had to write this guy back. after a few witty back-and-forths, we moved to text messages. the conversation kept rolling, until he mentioned something about pinot and pizza.
if planned parenthood were defunded, other family planning clinics in maine, including community health centers, would see a 63 percent increase in their patient load, she said at the time. some patients would need to drive greater distances to receive care, while others would have to wait longer for an appointment. ... this is about interfering with the ability of a woman to choose the health care provider who is right for her.
that development is hardly unique to michigan. the ranks of the uninsured have fallen everywhere, particularly in states, like michigan, that participated in obamacare's medicaid expansion. but in michigan, like every other state, there have also been trade-offs.
when he got a question about the white house demanding to review scientific reports before they are sent out publicly, chaffetz dismissed the question by noting he had not heard about the issue. when he got a question about trump using an unsecured phone, he said he didn't know about that either, and he wondered what obama had done. when a reporter answered that obama had a secure blackberry, chaffetz made a joke.
no one is above the law in our constitutional system, kavanaugh said. no matter where you come from, no matter how rich you are, how poor you are, no matter your race, gender, your position in life … it's all equal justice under law.
democratic senators are assuredly going to question the nominee as to whether he or she supports trump's position on the lawsuit. normally, nominees punt on these sorts of questions, arguing that the issue could come before them if they are confirmed to the court.
but people at higher incomes receive no such assistance and, in some cases, the premiums make it difficult or even impossible for them to get traditional insurance. this is particularly true in more rural parts of the country, and especially for older consumers, thanks to a combination of factors ― some related to the design of the aca, and some related to the way hostile republican officials at the state and national level have implemented it.
the delay also comes one day after white house press secretary sean spicer agreed with chief deputy whip patrick mchenry (r-n.c.)'s assessment that president donald trump is the closer.
critically, the gop proposal would also eliminate extra subsidies, available under the affordable care act, that reduce out-of-pocket expenses for people whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line, or about $60,000 for a family of four.
the self-reliant community supported itself at a time when black people were subject to racial violence and laws that reinforced segregation. blacks, when we weren't being treated fairly in jim crow, you can go to your own stores and be treated right, he said. so we were rich back then because we supported each other, and we were more of the consumer back then like we are today. so that's what helped those black wall streets grow.
trump attempted to gin up controversy during a press conference on sunday night, citing a new york times op-ed by a catholic leftist and unnamed comedians who he said were engaging in disgraceful attacks on barrett's faith.
if a person who appeared to be of middle eastern descent used a piece of equipment at the gym before mekelburg did, she'd either clean it excessively, complain it was gross or refuse to use the machine, galasso said. she was cruel in every form.
trump hasn't meddled in gop senate primaries, avoiding endorsements of controversial candidates and largely following mcconnell's lead. but it turns out republicans were just worried about the wrong type of statewide race.
from this moment on, in new york city, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, de blasio said.
and it is poor women and women of color who are most likely to seek abortion in the first place. currently 50 percent are below the poverty line, and another 25 percent are low income. this is a marked change since 1973, when abortion was most common among white middle-class women. that reflects, in part, the availability today of more reliable, but also more expensive, forms of birth control such as the birth control pill, which is 99 percent effective when used correctly, and the iud, which can cost $1,200 to insert but requires no further action on the part of the user, like remembering to take a pill. obamacare required insurers to pay for those methods, but changes in health care law under the trump administration have reversed that.
instead, the united states of care aims to serve as a kind of brain trust and troubleshooting resource for state governments seeking to expand coverage. a potential target audience for the group's work might include republican governors who have proved less inimical to medicaid expansion. some states are also struggling to forge health care compromises between democratic governors and republican legislatures, and vice versa.
the only thing consistent about trump's views is that whatever comes after the affordable care act will be 'terrific' and 'better' and 'less expensive.'
correction: a previous version of this article incorrectly described criticism about legislation introduced by sen. tillis' that offers protections for people with preexisting conditions. health policy experts say it does prohibit insurers from denying applicants based on pre-existing conditions and excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage, but it leaves out other protections, such as those for essential health benefits.
people are not just sitting around and watching tv. they are frontliners, she said.
greenblatt said he has a long track record of fair and independent oversight and assured lawmakers he has no intention of shutting down ongoing investigations.
but without their bill, many republicans concede they should do something to bring more certainty to insurers offering plans in 2018.
booker's math is off, even if his point has merit and is shared by other skeptics: thanks to the late arizona sen. john mccain and his infamous thumbs down, republicans were never able to muster even the 50 votes they needed to repeal obamacare through the reconciliation process.
under the trump administration's regulations, the marketing material for short-term plans must contain clear, prominent language informing consumers that the policies are not equivalent to the more comprehensive plans that comply with affordable care act standards. in theory, that should give consumers the information they need to make an informed choice ― a point that administration officials have made repeatedly as their proposal has come under attack.
the 21-year-old university of south carolina senior grew up going to the polls with her mom and grandma, and they instilled in her the importance of voting in every election once she turned 18. she'd just made the cut in the 2016 presidential election, when she cast her vote for hillary clinton. this year, she's leaning toward warren because she has a plan for everything.
the former vice president has begun testing the approach as he nears an expected campaign launch later this month. after remarks at a recent labor union event, biden said he was proud to be an obama-biden democrat, coining a term that his advisers define as pragmatic and progressive, and a bridge between the working-class white voters who have long had an affinity for biden and the younger, more diverse voters who backed obama in historic numbers.
when asked about the funding his pac receives from big business executives, moulton noted his support for campaign finance reform. but he insisted that campaign cash has never affected his policy positions.
trump has throughout these efforts made claims like he did on thursday night ― that he would make sure there was insurance for everybody and that coverage would be cheaper and more secure than it was already.
the online district court cases do include a principal amount sought in a warrant in debt case. however, if the case is settled or dismissed, the principal amount is zero. therefore, khn's reporting of the total for which uva has sued its patients during this period is likely a low estimate.
none of this should be surprising. the architects of the affordable care act were trying to make sure everybody could get decent insurance, regardless of income, and they were willing to adjust financial assistance in order to make that possible. the republicans who would replace the affordable care act aren't trying to put insurance within everybody's reach. they are simply trying to offer a tax break that would available to people buying health insurance, and even then only under some circumstances.
bloomberg via getty images sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) is apparently on board with the possibility of ousting attorney general jeff sessions after the election.
in most states around the country, democrat jon ossoff would have lost his senate race on election night 2020. republican sen. david perdue had racked up 88,000 more votes than ossoff in the first round of voting ― but had failed to win a majority of the votes cast. in georgia, that meant the race would go to a runoff. (perude needed 13,000 additional votes to reach the 50% mark; libertarian candidate shane hazel earned 115,000 votes.)
and yet for the first few years, the program would likely cost the federal government a lot less than medicare for all would. less federal spending likely means fewer tax increases and that could be another political advantage.
frelinghuysen's announcement was a bit of surprise, considering he could still serve as the top republican on the powerful appropriations committee for another four years under house gop rules. but faced with the prospect of a tough race ― hillary clinton lost to donald trump in that district by only 1 point in 2016 ― as well as internal discussions about removing frelinghuysen as chairman after he voted against the party's tax bill, the 71-year-old gop moderate decided to call it quits.
who will govern us – the party of white identity, or one that respects our common humanity?
it absolutely is an argument for medicare for all, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told huffpost tuesday.
a: conservative-leaning critics would say all that government control is bound to stifle innovation, that the free market allocates resources better than the federal government, and that this approach could potentially lead to shortages and rationing.
in the post op-ed, he described seething at past supreme court decisions upholding the affordable care act, even though that's what he's now hoping the court will do. two wrongs don't make a right, he wrote.
voters blamed congressional republicans for a shutdown in 2013 (when the gop wanted to extract concessions on killing obamacare) and two from 1995 to 1996 (when president bill clinton refused to go along with gop budget cuts).
let me be clear, i'm a democrat and i'm a proud democrat and hold democratic values, peters said in an interview with huffpost. but there's a lot of governing that can be done in a way that we build some consensus and in the long run we have to return our country to that kind of way of operating.
that microscopic margin means nearly everything that happened during the hassan-ayotte race could have been a determining factor. did ayotte's decision to disavow trump following revelations he bragged about committing sexual assault lead some conservatives to back trump-supporting independent aaron day, who got about 17,000 votes? ayotte's team has long disputed this idea, noting she ran ahead of the gop presidential nominee.
if they want to bid on the really juicy federal health care contracts, they should have to offer a basic private insurance plan for individuals as well, even if those exchange plans aren't quite as juicy for their investors, warren said. and if some insurance companies really, truly aren't willing to provide high-quality, affordable coverage in exchange for billions of dollars in federal subsidies and access to medicare and medicaid ― if they really, truly want to pick up their toys and go home because their bazillion-dollar profits aren't high enough ― then i say good riddance.
joshua roberts / reuters house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) has insisted that the president will be able to get the american health care act -- which is house republicans' proposal to replace the affordable care act -- passed.
after all, they also want obamacare obliterated ― they just don't want their fingerprints on the detonator.
the huffpost/yougov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted from aug. 24 to 26 among u.s. adults, using a sample selected from yougov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult u.s. population.
popular resistance to the repeal of the affordable care act has begun, with the first signal that republicans could face major political repercussions coming from the large denver suburb of aurora, colorado.
but moderate democrats, like presidential nominee joe biden, have disavowed medicare for all, citing concerns about forcing people satisfied with their employer-sponsored plans into a new program. gross now justifies his embrace of a more modest solution as a practical way forward given the difficulty of previous reform efforts.
trump also failed to ensure that ordinary workers would share in the economy's gains by making it easier for workers to unionize, spriggs said. he filled the national labor relations board with pro-business, republican appointees and curtailed federal government employees' collective bargaining rights.
gary friedman via getty images covered california has been one of the most successful of the affordable care act's exchanges. but lots of californians still struggle with premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
the forum ― hosted by the american federation of state, county and municipal employees, and moderated by huffpost's amanda terkel and the nevada independent's jon ralston ― provided the candidates their own individual time to burrow deep into policy and defend their records. it also underscored the influence of organized labor in this primary, with nearly every serious contender in attendance to court union support.
polls show evers with democrats' best chance ever of defeating republican gov. scott walker, whose moves to crush unions and subsequent political survival have made him public enemy number one for badger state liberals. democratic enthusiasm in the state — helped by opposition to trump, the presence of progressive sen. baldwin on the ballot, and long-standing antipathy to walker — remains high.
her thinking on the latest challenge to the affordable care act is more difficult to pin down. her full statement in that 2017 law review article makes plain that she thinks roberts got it wrong when he joined the liberals in 2012. like many conservative critics, she says it was wrong to call the mandate penalty a tax when the text itself doesn't.
overall, the verdict in this election is unambiguous: the majority of citizens want biden, not trump, to run the country. looking back on the last four years, it's not at all hard to imagine why they might have made that decision.
the legal question is whether trump's administration had legal authority to expand the exemption under both the obamacare law itself and another federal law, the religious freedom restoration act, which allows people to press religious claims against the federal government.
the hospital recorded an additional $109 million in uncollectible debts not considered indigent care, the document shows.
during her confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee two weeks ago, barrett, a favorite of christian conservatives, sidestepped questions on abortion, presidential powers, climate change, voting rights, obamacare and other issues.
getting yelled at by voters in the basement of your local vfw
trump attended a $35,000-a-person fundraiser wednesday for his 2020 re-election campaign ― at the trump international hotel down the street from the white house, once again using his political power to benefit his business interests, flaunting his kleptocratic awfulness and disregard for ethics standards right in front of the american people. i was outside with a feisty group of protestors, but reporters, after being told by the white house late in the day that they could attend, were afterwards uninvited because of supposed logistical concerns. us protestors could see the event, or maybe some lower-donor auxiliary room of it, through the hotel windows, and we saw one guy making a point of chewing plates of food while staring at us, while a jonah ryanish dork pressed his ear against the glass and mouthed i can't hear you.
there is not yet a path for everybody who was uninsured or becomes uninsured to get new coverage, she continued. and for some people, there's a path, but it's really windy and if you get lost on the way, you're going to wind up not getting coverage.
those issues ― not impeachment or tweets or the president's general unfitness for office ― seem to be the things democrats want to target in 2020, particularly in the areas where trump won in 2016.
president biden does not believe, as a principle, it should be difficult ... for people to gain access to health care, she said. he's not been supportive in the past, and is not today, of putting additional restrictions in place.
rob jarvis, a democratic candidate running for congress in ohio, a state ravaged by opioids, timed how long trump spent on the crisis in tonight's speech. we got about 49 seconds, he reported to huffpost. and most of what trump said, he noted, was fear-based.
the hospital ranked no. 1 in virginia by u.s. news & world report is taxpayer-supported and state-funded, not a company with profit motives and shareholder demands. like other nonprofit hospitals, it pays no federal, state or local taxes on the presumption it offers charity care and other community benefits worth at least as much as those breaks. democratic gov. ralph northam, a pediatric neurologist, oversees its board.
at the same time, republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the kinds of insurance available. this is expected to result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health ― and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions.
some members acknowledge that pelosi has actually made efforts to include them in the lawmaking process.
these groups, most of which are religious based, have seen double digit increases in memberships the past few years, thanks in great part to an exemption they received to requirements in the affordable care act (aca).
i like the socialism side of bernie; i think a lot of people are scared of socialism because they think it's more like communism, but it's not, said goodwin, who also added he was leaning toward warren, as he sat in his barber chair. it's just like everybody lives equally. and i like the fact of free school and free health care because most of the other countries have this.
he added that the government should want treatments and tests to be at no cost to the patient because diseases are communicable, and that the current for-profit system disincentivizes people from going to the doctor and getting tested.
and businesses have been largely unaffected by the paid leave program, according to a widely cited survey milkman co-authored a few years ago. for those employers already offering leave, the policy means they spend less on the benefit.
nationally, the number of people without insurance was at an all-time low when obama left office. people who had asthma, diabetes or a history of cancer or heart disease finally had a way to buy comprehensive coverage, just like people in good health, with no markup for their preexisting conditions.
those are just some of the likely consequences if the federal courts rule in favor of a lawsuit challenging the affordable care act and decide — as president donald trump said he hopes they will — that the entire law has to come off the books.
it is a concept, he said. i hope it can get bipartisanship.
rolls back medicaid expansion. thirty-one states and the district of columbia have expanded eligibility for medicaid, thereby insuring more than 10 million people, by taking advantage of extra federal funds that the affordable care act set aside for that purpose. starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer provide those federal funds for people who newly qualify under the expanded eligibility standards. the federal government would continue to provide the extra funds for any expansion enrollee who was on the program before 2020 ― until he or she left medicaid, as people inevitably do. eventually, the expansion population would dwindle and disappear without the federal dollars.
had clinton won, and had house republicans taken the beating that many were predicting, conservatives were preparing to block speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) from another term in the speakership, with the idea that someone like rep. mike pompeo (r-kan.) ― now trump's cia director ― could take the job.
chaffetz, however, appears dead-set on not poking around into trump's finances. he notes he never did a personal investigation into obama or clinton ― that he only probed issues surrounding their government service ― and he doesn't sound eager to go after trump.
twitter users were quick to zero in on one particular element. in a framed portrait, positioned on a side table, is a glam shot of conway decked out in fur.
she added: when i hear that an average american is going to have to spend $600,000 for a green new deal, you can understand how people like me don't think that's logical.
even so, while the question of whether private coverage can coexist with broadened public plans in the united states is a genuine sticking point among democrats, the responses from the candidates who addressed the issue wednesday and thursday nights also highlighted their apparently universal conviction that the federal government should play a much larger role in providing health coverage.
but in a red state like kentucky, where trump is popular and the gop is, too, beating bevin was never going to be easy. it took nearly perfect circumstances in the bluegrass state — and required a candidate, a party, a campaign and an energized grassroots movement working in concert to take advantage of it.
house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady, r-texas, and the tax law's sponsor, has called criticisms that the legislation benefits the wealthy more than the poor baloney. brady argued shortly after trump signed the bill into law that families in his home state of texas would see on average $2,000 more a year in after-tax income.

in the weeks ahead, civil rights lawyers are gearing up to fight for her legacy.
enjeti ― who, like krein, identifies as a right-wing populist ― believes that pro-corporate, trickle-down economics has been an especially tough sell amid the destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recession that has come with it.
my republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think that the american people hate paying taxes but they just love paying insurance premiums, sanders said.
leadership is also looking to stay on the good side of the progressives, despite the occasional slip of the tongue from pelosi.
at the end of the day, i simply cannot erase my skin color even as i am clear i have to challenge sexism and classism and homophobia and transphobia and all forms of hate and oppression, always, within myself. what i am saying is that even within our different marginalized groups, there remains, still, a very real skin-color hierarchy. and while that goes on, that tiny minority that controls everything continues to horde its power and its privilege, and it continues to dictate to the rest of us what we can and cannot do, who we can and cannot be.
we're talking about $51 trillion, the elimination of planes, the elimination of cows, a railway, no planes, i guess nobody can go to hawaii anymore, she said. it doesn't sound rational to me.

tonight, we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet. he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall ― more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps. today is judah's 81st birthday. judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. suddenly the train screeched to a halt. a soldier appeared. judah's family braced for the worst. then, his father cried out with joy: it's the americans.
celinda lake, a leading pollster and democratic strategist who has closely studied maine, thinks collins' political strategy on kavanaugh may be misguided. polls show that maine voters broadly want to see roe upheld and that trump's popularity is declining there. and independent voters in maine, on whom collins relies as a moderate, are wildly in love with their sen. angus king, who caucuses with the democrats and has indicated that he'll vote against kavanaugh.
the question is why gop moderates are so timid about signaling they won't go along with a bill that guts the program. dent is posturing that there are vote problems if republicans repeal the expansion, but at this point, it's just posturing.
california is showing the way to do both, anthony wright, executive director of the california consumer advocacy group health access, told huffpost. you can have a vision for how you plan and think deliberately about getting to universal coverage, but that doesn't have to get in the way of taking concrete, significant steps to provide health care now.
white house office of management and budget director mick mulvaney argued that coverage numbers aren't important. price pledged the gop plan would result in more people having health coverage than do today and that nobody will be worse off financially. and on sunday, ryan dodged the issue ― when asked about how many people would be covered under his bill, he said, i can't answer that question. the speaker previously described comparisons of how many people have coverage under the affordable care act to how many would have it under the american health care act as a beauty contest.
morry gash/getty images president donald trump adopted a less aggressive posture in his second and final 2020 presidential debate. but he did not produce any game-changing moments.
by the end of 2015, likely well over 80,000 u.s. residents had filled at least one prescription for the daily tablet. and given the steadily increasing rate of new prescriptions registered each quarter, the population of hiv-negative people who have at least tried prep has probably swelled considerably by now. this is fantastic news for the effort to stem the tide of hiv infections among men who have sex with men (msm), whom data suggest make up the vast majority of prep users. while it's still too early to determine truvada's initial impact on infection trends—prep started gaining popularity only in late 2013—clinics with large populations of high-risk msm on prep have reported very low hiv rates among them.
looking back, the affordable care act has accomplished much of what it set out to do. the number of people without insurance has reached historic lows. a growing pile of independent, peer-reviewed studies has shown that, overall, people are having an easier time getting medical care, suffering fewer financial problems because of medical bills, and are healthier as a result.
i really hesitate to say this because i was an obama supporter, said handler, 49. i honestly 100% believe that the quality of customer service, the quality of consumer rights, the quality of care — everything has been compromised by the affordable care act.
to enhance successful integration; the top 5% of the illegals will move to staten island, ny. hillary will have connections there from her days as one of the most admired arkansan senators. the former residents of the majestic island will believe they have hit the jackpot. these beach lovers will move en masse into the bankrupt trump casinos in ac. they will once again brag of their place down at the sure.
others are enthusiastic about medicare for all, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition ― for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. that's the approach of a new bill from reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and jan schakowsky (d-ill.).
to replace these broadly popular elements of obamacare, trump again promised something vague that he has had four years to elaborate on but has never done: a brand new, beautiful health care.
gail hagwood said she isn't surprised that the cuts will disproportionately affect minorities. hagwood, 63, is the church administrator for the galilean house of worship in henry county in southwestern virginia. she said she noticed a few dollars more in her monthly paycheck since the tax law went into effect — but not enough to a make a difference in her lifestyle.
many women only reported their employers after they had left their jobs. that was the case with an employee at a sunglass hut in indiana who had trouble getting breaks and pumping at the mall. the investigator wrote that she filed a complaint because she simply wants to educate the employer.
senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) and house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) have not heard a peep from the trump administration regarding health care reform, their offices said. nor have the house and senate minority whips, rep. steny hoyer (d-md.) and sen. dick durbin (d-ill.), according to their offices.
i'm worried because everything that they've laid out, the platforms that i've heard, they tend to be a tax increase in it, and it's going to cost somebody some money, he said. those kinds of things worry me, because i think they would hurt the nation, and they would hurt me and what little saving i have and what little saving a lot of people have. they wake up one morning; it would be evaporated, gone.
we can work alongside advocates of all stripes. andy slavitt, the united states of care
the future of patient care is entirely on trump and his administration, who have, in his own words, already put politics over patients. if people lose access to care, he will have no one to blame but himself.
it's probably safe to say republicans are going through rhetorical contortions about the affordable care act and their efforts to do away with it in the courts because the law's popularity has never been higher, especially its protections for people with preexisting conditions.
that pedigree doesn't mean the 5th circuit judges will also rule against the affordable care act. but late last month, they made an ominous request of the parties. they asked for extra briefs on whether the democratic officials who have taken up the law's defense have standing to appear in court.
this has been an all-out war on suppressing wages to increase profits. joe biden
with kennedy retiring, roberts ― a conservative justice appointed by george w. bush ― will likely become the swing vote on obamacare. in addition to health care, democrats are going to be emphasizing the threat to abortion access from potential justices, since kennedy has long been the main obstacle to overturning the landmark 1973 roe v. wade decision. trump has promised to nominate justices who will overturn the ruling and ban abortion rights.
americans say by a 17-percentage-point margin, 40 percent to 23 percent, that gorsuch, the federal appeals judge nominated by president donald trump to fill the seat left vacant by the death of antonin scalia, should be confirmed. an additional 37 percent aren't sure. (a poll taken after gorsuch's nomination was first announced in february found that americans favored confirmation by a similar 15-point margin, 43 percent to 28 percent, with 29 percent undecided.)
the recess cuts two ways, however. lawmakers may also hear from their constituents over the august break and come back in september ready to force the issue. those sorts of movements have happened in recent augusts past. in 2013, then-speaker john boehner sensed that his members were willing to shut down government over obamacare, and when they came back from the break, he followed suit. in 2015, boehner sensed that republicans were ready to throw him out of the speakership, and by the end of september, he had announced that he was stepping down.
congress passed a huge tax bill last year that, among other things, repealed the individual mandate, a central component of the affordable care act that required most u.s. residents to obtain health coverage or face tax penalties. starting in 2019, those penalties won't exist anymore.
when the pandemic ends, obama, pelosi and all of their allies may finally get a chance to have that celebratory event they'd originally planned for this week.

she lost. the judge, according to court records, said that nelson had the ability to decline the surgery if she didn't like the terms of the deal. she lived with a lien on her farm until she managed to pay off the debt.
you'll see it when we roll it out, walden said, but the long and short of it is we have a great opportunity to reform medicaid, a positive way to give flexibility to states, to bend the cost curve down.
he insulted us, jailed us, we must not elect him president, the narrator declares.
a: sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) is a co-sponsor of the bill sanders has introduced in the senate but has said she would attain medicare for all through a two-step process as president.
but the legislation declares that the new plans shall not be deemed to be insurance, and there's a reason for that. iowa's lawmakers want to make sure the policies aren't subject to the affordable care act's insurance regulations, including those that protect people with pre-existing conditions.
since the fda approved medication abortion in the year 2000, over 2 million u.s. women have used medication to safely and successfully end a pregnancy. statistics show more and more women are choosing this option for its flexibility, privacy and safety. that's why we are running our #10weekafterpill campaign. not only to raise awareness about the abortion pill, but also to improve access to a simple medical option that many may still not be aware of - or in some cases, might confuse with emergency contraception (plan b).
but if the law's weaknesses were never more apparent, the same goes for its strengths.
but there's another change in the republican bill capable of causing even greater pain to older americans and the people who love them: changes to medicaid that could exacerbate the long-term care crisis in which many americans who need nursing homes can't afford them.
and i think what's important is to see the proof in the pudding. so, people are concerned ― they're going to remain concerned until such time as the organization has the opportunity to do its work.
in fact, from her short time on the bench, it seems barrett's conservative inclination is to rule against the rights of individuals, particularly those who are oppressed.
of course, a functioning market in michigan doesn't mean much for consumers in places like arizona, north carolina or tennessee, where the problems are far more severe and may yet get worse ― resulting in higher prices for some people, and fewer choices for nearly everyone. on wednesday, yet another national insurer, anthem, warned that it will start scaling back its presence ― just as aetna and unitedhealth have ― if it doesn't see better returns from its exchange products.
walsh said a similar thing happened with salem radio network, which had been syndicating the am talk radio show he began after leaving congress in 2013. he was told in 2017, during the obamacare repeal debate, that he could not speak about the issue at all if he criticized trump's position. that restriction grew to prohibit any criticism of trump, he said ― a rule he said some salem hosts agreed to live by but he would not. he learned this summer that his contract with salem would not be renewed at the end of this year.
in the debate in nashville, though, biden was particularly pithy as he dispensed with trump's efforts to turn him into a left-wing icon.
the additional taxes will bring the hospital an estimated $2.5 million a year and perhaps take it out of the red, but they won't necessarily lift goodall-witcher out of financial peril, willmann said.
although there were concerns about voter suppression due to most counties' decision to limit in-person voting to a single location, the expansion of mail-in voting proved largely successful in driving turnout. some voters, however, faced delays in receiving their ballots and there were notably long lines at the polls in lexington, pointing to issues that kentucky needs to address before november's election.
republicans lost control of the house of representatives in november, and with it they lost the ability to pass legislation repealing obamacare. they might regain that ability someday, maybe even in 2021 if political circumstances are favorable enough. but the repeal effort was highly unpopular and possibly the single biggest reason republicans lost as many seats as they did. gop leaders in washington aren't going to try again without thinking about that backlash.

in terms of what it does, it decides that the individual mandate is unconstitutional ― and that a big chunk of the aca may be invalid, nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor, told huffpost. but it doesn't say how much or how little is invalid, and leaves it to judge o'connor [to decide].
the chief and justice kavanaugh are both expressing strong skepticism of the red states' position on severability, joseph palmore, a former assistant to the u.s. solicitor general who is now co-chair of morrison & foerster's supreme court practice group, wrote on twitter. if they stick with that position, the #aca will survive.
a series of firearm safety bills passed in connecticut, including two safe storage laws and one ghost gun law. the storage laws require all firearms, loaded or unloaded, to be safely stored in homes occupied by minors, and for pistols kept in vehicles to only be stored in the trunk, a locked glove box, or a locked safe.
sometimes insurers would refuse to pay for claims or even cancel coverage outright, even if there was scant evidence anybody had covered up an illness. indignation over the practice reinforced calls for reform, and helped make the enactment of obamacare and its protections for people with serious medical conditions possible.
the cost of the aca's compromises
the trump bump has saved bevin from going into election day as the most unpopular governor in the country ― that's now rhode island democrat gina raimondo, according to the morning consult ratings ― and he may get another boost when trump stops in lexington to campaign for him monday. but bevin's abrasive style could still leave him adrift in a state with a political culture that was historically less confrontational than national politics, said stephen voss, a university of kentucky political science professor.
he added the proviso that it was up to the people who lived through those grim days to ensure that kids who did not witness sept. 11 appreciate what the sacrifices meant.
the 2017 bill those representatives approved was called the american health care act, or ahca. although early versions of the legislation left the affordable care act's insurance regulations mostly intact, the version that finally passed the house included an amendment, designed to win support from the most conservative republicans, that undermined pre-existing condition protections even for people with employer-sponsored insurance.
that can save firms significant money, says boushey.
mcconnell's allies believe he's been at his weakest when trump and rank-and-file republicans have questioned his effectiveness, such as when obamacare repeal failed in the senate in the summer of 2017. but they argue his work to push through kavanaugh's nomination has restored his approval rating among republicans, making his reelection in kentucky safer (no gop primary challenger has emerged yet) and strengthening his hand when dealing with donors and candidates across the country.
it is useful and necessary to ration services that are not efficacious or cost effective based on scientific evidence, as is done successfully by such countries as the united kingdom, with their national institute for health and care excellence (nice). we do the opposite with our industry-friendly fda approval process. one good example of that is the fda's approval of a 23 mg dose of the alzheimer's drug aricept despite the lack of clinical evidence that it is better than a 10 mg dose and without concern that patients taking the larger dose stopped taking it twice as often due to adverse side effects.

as we move through 2017, there has been a lot of apprehension about the future of access to abortion and reproductive healthcare. (what may come as a surprise to some decision makers is there are studies that suggest the repeal of obamacare may result in a higher abortion rate.)
monday's briefs raised additional arguments that might appeal to conservative judges ― like challenging whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to decide this sort of case or whether the plaintiffs have standing to file such a lawsuit. a reversal of o'connor's decision on either grounds would allow judges to avoid ruling on the merits of the affordable care act while stopping the lawsuit from going forward.
the president often has his own reasons for bringing up certain topics, sometimes it's to distract from something else or change the subject. i don't know, amash said.
the debates didn't shed much light on the answers to those questions. voters will get their first chance to weigh in by february when the iowa caucuses begin and campaign season kicks into high gear.
to be clear, the differences between medicare for all and the more incremental approaches still matter. and they matter a lot.
if we want to reach trump supporters, we need to beat trump at his own game. workshopped cliches like forward together and a better deal will help said cause by about 0%. to win minds, we need to deconstruct trump's tricks while presenting a more compelling vision. and nothing will do this more effectively than taking his promise and fleshing it out in detail so as to help people understand the real choice in front of them.
nevertheless, he said, what he got from the aca was a huge help.
during the days before the cbo released its numbers, leading republicans also made inconsistent promises about the effects of their bill on the number of people with health insurance.
collins' maneuvering throughout the impeachment trial was a carefully orchestrated balancing act. behind the scenes, she pushed her party to give at least the appearance of a fair trial by insisting on longer opening and closing arguments by both the house managers and trump's defense team. but even with her vote to allow witnesses, few observers actually expected her to vote to convict trump and anger his most ardent supporters, especially considering that mcconnell had already secured the necessary majority to acquit him anyway.
his appearance at the drive-in rally of about 360 people, according to his aides, offered a vivid example of the hyperlocal campaign harrison has waged. as the senate voted on barrett's nomination on monday evening ― a hugely consequential development that dominated the airwaves in washington ― harrison delivered a speech that made no mention of it.

as an academic surgeon, i was also bothered by the fact that this opinion piece failed to properly acknowledge those who were involved in the research upon which the article relied. usually, these people are named as co-authors. instead, they are named in a small paragraph just before the reference section. all were employees of the executive office of the president and there were no physicians in the group. again, bias was obvious.
dear gop: when democrats are setting themselves ablaze by advocating for the destruction of american health care, try to resist the temptation of asking them to pass the kerosene, tweeted josh holmes, a republican consultant who previously served as chief of staff to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.).
on several occasions last summer, the president taunted and mocked mccain at rallies where trump's supporters chanted in response, drain the swamp! mccain set off that criticism when, just days after receiving his devastating medical diagnosis, he voted against a republican health care bill to repeal and replace obamacare with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture.
american airlines says it will book full flights despite growing number of coronavirus cases ― 6/27/20, 4:00 p.m. et
the supreme court's one-sentence declaration turning down that request makes it impossible to know why the justices made that decision or what they will do next. they could still take the case in the coming term, which begins in october, or wait until the lower courts are finished sorting through the case.
ernst, a member of gop leadership in the senate, supports moving forward with the confirmation of trump's nominee this presidential election year despite helping block president barack obama's nominee to the supreme court in 2016.
though he took particular delight in trashing cruz, trump appeared equally intent on sticking a thumb in the eye of anyone who had the gall to tell him -- the guy who defied all the pundits by getting this far -- that he was somehow doing it all wrong.
one member on the democratic caucus call complained to huffpost on thursday that the legislation may or may not include infrastructure funding, may or may not include money for the postal service or election security, and may or may not fix problems with the small business loan program that congress established more than a month ago.
but naturally, instead of just using this information to criticize the law and propose something better (or something terrific, as he's fond of saying), trump opted to go a little nuts.
these two programs are jointly operated and financed by the federal government and the states, and there are different benefits and income limits among the states. but medicaid generally is for people with very low incomes ― which would include jobless people who abruptly find themselves with no income at all except for unemployment insurance.

and just a few weeks before that, the century foundation and american prospect magazine ― both well-known incubators of ideas democratic officials end up using ― convened a washington, d.c., conference. it included some of the most influential liberal policy experts. the goal was to begin hashing out the details of plans for improving or replacing the system the affordable care act has created, on the theory that opportunities to pass ambitious legislation may not be far away.
there may be even less debate about the merits of the lawsuit. the most important part of the case is its contention that wiping out the entire law is consistent with congressional intent because when congress first passed the law in 2010, it considered the mandate an essential part of the program's machinery.
a bipartisan health care package will likely also be excluded from the spending bill, lawmakers told cnn. the measure would have included federal subsidies aimed at driving down insurance premiums in the obamacare marketplace. negotiations over the measure reached an impasse, however, after gop lawmakers insisted on new abortion restrictions on those insurance plans.
if president trump gets his way, 130 million americans with pre-existing conditions will lose the aca's lifesaving protections and 23 million americans will lose their health coverage entirely, pelosi said in a statement. there is no legal justification and no moral excuse for the trump administration's disastrous efforts to take away americans' health care.

in reality, studies have shown, the kind of people who would get coverage through medicaid expansion (poor, non-elderly adults) usually have jobs or have reasons, such as disability, for why they don't work. there's no compelling evidence that the requirements encourage more people to get jobs and lots of compelling evidence suggesting the requirements have the opposite effect, because the considerable administrative hassles cause people to lose their coverage even when they shouldn't ― at which point they get sick and then really can't get or keep a job.
human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
alex brandon/associated press this is how it works, says mitch mcconnell.
some states have passed their own, more expansive laws, covering workers who are carved out of the federal statute. but there are still large gaps. the center for worklife law, a research group at the university of california's hastings college of law, estimates that 27.6 million women of child-bearing age aren't legally guaranteed time and space to pump at work. if any of those women filed a complaint, there is little that federal investigators could do about it.
as a teenager, mekelburg attended east brunswick high school, where she stood out for her athletic ability and was a key member of the state championship soccer team. she graduated in 1991. east brunswick high, according to one former classmate, was not a diverse school. it was predominantly white with a large jewish population, the classmate said. he estimated that less than 1 percent of their nearly 500-person class were muslim.
politically, barrett's confirmation couldn't have come at a better time for graham, who led her hearings as chair of the senate judiciary committee. his closing message to voters in ads and in nightly fox news appearances, where he makes direct appeals for funds, has mainly focused on the impact of a conservative supreme court majority and what he says will happen if democrats take control of the senate.
the latest version of medicare for all also includes coverage of home health aides, job counselors, and other supports that allow disabled and elderly people to live on their own, outside of nursing homes or other institutions.
the supposed upside to this approach is that insurers based in lightly regulated states could sell barebones policies to people elsewhere. and while that might enable some people to get a better deal, it would be disastrous for the health insurance markets. if people who need insurance the least can buy the cheap, skimpy plan that wouldn't serve the needs of sicker people, that would leave only the latter group in the insurance pool in the state where they live. this eventually would drive up premiums to an unsustainable degree.
in 2009, a 60 minutes/vanity fair poll placed a secession question in the context of obamacare asking survey respondents which state (california, texas, alaska or hawaii) they would most like to see go. california lead the way with 10% of respondents followed by texas with 8%. alaska and hawaii finished with 3% each. the good news for our imperfect union is that 60% said none (or perhaps less optimistically that they were not sure which state they hoped would leave).
in summary, latinos want to hear that our next president cares about our natural resources, and is ready to fight for them -- and against climate change -- using all the tools available.
the state's insurers say they are particularly worried about persistency ― the extent to which people may be buying coverage during open enrollment or because of a qualifying life event like divorce, and then dropping it after getting a few expensive medical services.
alyse galvin, who is also an independent, and an education activist, is running against young a second time. in 2018, she fell just shy of 7 percentage points behind young, and this time, she's raising more money than him. young, known in washington for his bad behavior and abrasive style (he literally pulled a knife on john boehner once), has spent his 48 years in congress bringing federal funding back for alaska. but galvin says young's time has passed.

imperial county, a rural area east of san diego, just reported a seven-day average positive rate on coronavirus tests of 23%, compared with the statewide rate of 5.7%.
short-term policies won't be available everywhere, because states can restrict or even prohibit them. some have done so already. but whether more follow will hinge, in part, on who is making the decisions come 2019.
donald trump made himself the center of attention like no previous chief executive, turning his every public appearance into must-watch television. he picked fights with fellow world leaders in phone calls, in speeches and on twitter. he hinted about the size of his genitalia in a threat about nuclear weapons. he made falsehoods a defining feature of his white house, averaging nearly a half-dozen each day and racking up more than 2,000 as president. he has, repeatedly, made his own ignorance, his mental fitness and his bigot-friendly racial views a focus of national conversation.
for over fifteen years. that would new york-presbyterian hospital/weill cornell medical center with about 2300 beds. (when folks don't have health insurance, they rely on the er, which is the most expensive portal into the health care system.) 14 million is about three and a half times the number of babies born every year in the us. (some pregnant women will likely unable to obtain adequate prenatal care under the proposed gop legislation.)

first, hillary's campaign (aided by the democratic national committee) pretended that bernie's campaign didn't even exist, since everyone knew hillary would be the nominee before a single vote was cast. when that failed, bernie's candidacy was simply dismissed since someone calling himself a democratic socialist could never win in a general election. when bernie's campaign became competitive, his goals and prescriptions for what america needed were given a pat on the head and dismissed as well-meaning but naïve idealism. later, hillary characterized bernie's proposals as pie in the sky stuff meant to trick young people to vote for him with promises of free stuff, continuing the characterization of bernie supporters as mostly dumb children (literally or just intellectually) who don't do their research, think for themselves, or understand politics, the issues, or how the real world works, and are thus deserving of hillary's pity. and, of course, there was the infamous double-barrel blast of feminist icon gloria steinem and former secretary of state madeleine albright -- both hillary supporters -- who respectively characterized young women who support bernie as simply being boy crazy (since, as steinem said, the boys are with bernie,) and earning themselves a special place in hell for not supporting another woman (both later apologized). and, for dessert, there's the implication by some hillary supporters that those critical of hillary are simply misogynists or those duped by republican propaganda.
what congress did in 2017 supersedes what it did in 2010, as a high-profile, ideologically diverse group of law professors wrote in a friend of the court brief. two of them were conservative- or libertarian-leaning experts who played key roles in previous challenges to the health care law.
obamacare expanded medicaid in two ways. first, it added eligibility for all adults earning up to 138% of the poverty level (previously, eligibility was largely focused on the very poor, single mothers, and the disabled). second, for individuals made newly-eligible by that expansion, obamacare provided a higher federal payment share for their medical expenses. for traditional medicaid, the federal share is, on average, 57%. obamacare provided a 90% federal share for the expansion population.
democrats quickly closed ranks behind biden after a tumultuous primary because they were so determined to oust trump. but they remain divided ideologically and temperamentally, with arguments already breaking out. on thursday, progressives and moderates within the house democratic caucus fought on a conference call, arguing about why the party, which had hoped to pick up a few seats, instead lost several.
if an advantage of these public option plans is their relative lack of disruption, a disadvantage is their relative complexity.
this administration has focused in on those issues in ways that previous administrations did not, says heather boushey, the executive director and chief economist of the washington center for equitable growth, noting that's been driven in part by the obama administration's ideology and in part by the economic conditions over the last decade.

former secretary of state and 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said friday's victory came about because people fought hard.
bush, a registered nurse and pastor, has called for medicare for all, criminal justice reform and raising the minimum wage. but clay, armed with more money than his opponent and a record of never losing an election, remains confident.
trump's tax bill, which did become law, similarly reflected the traditional republican philosophy that the best way to boost the economy is to give the wealthiest people in the country more cash. he lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, lowered the top income tax rate from 39% to 36%, and expanded the amount of household wealth exempt from the estate tax to $22 million per couple.
the boldest, most sweeping idea democrats have is the one that bernie sanders, the independent senator from vermont, made famous in his 2016 bid for the democratic presidential nomination. he and his allies want to create a single government-run program that would cover all medical expenses and enroll every single person living in the u.s.
but most people who got coverage through the medicaid expansion are either working already or cannot hold jobs, because they are caring for others or have serious conditions of their own, studies have shown repeatedly. and in arkansas, which imposed work requirements last year, more than 18,000 people lost their coverage for failing to comply.
quist's campaign has plowed some of that cash into ads hitting gianforte for voicing support for the law.
we have long said we would work with republicans to improve the aca if republicans will drop repeal. but they have to drop repeal first, said schumer spokesman matt house.
for a guy throwing socialist rocks, huffman said, trump lives in a glass dacha.
asking for public comment in apparent preparation for a policy change that could harm millions of struggling americans over time, without providing the public with research and data on these basic questions, suggests this is not a serious effort to explore the important substantive issues that poverty measurement presents, parrott said in a statement.
exactly how this will all play out is difficult to know, as the regulatory changes are likely to affect individuals in widely varying ways.
the twist? he blames those measures on senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, not the president who signed them into law.
the future promises americans safety. the protection, north and south walls and no possibility of an attack by sea. in another decade, it will be impossible to enter us shores from the atlantic or pacific. all the plastic and debris washing up on our beaches will form a natural barrier.
these subsidies are paid to health insurance companies directly, and the law requires them to reduce eligible customers' cost-sharing whether the federal government makes the payments or not. and nonpayment isn't a theoretical problem; it's a real one.
editor's note: donald trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the u.s.
but they never gave up on their crusade to roll back the law, and last year the trump administration took the highly unusual step of having the justice department file a brief on behalf of the lawsuit. prior to this maneuver, three justice department lawyers removed their names from the brief, and one 20-year veteran of the department quit. trump nominated the lead lawyer who signed the brief, chad readler, for a federal judgeship the same day the department submitted its brief; the senate confirmed him this march.
when another reporter asked about trump's insistence that there was massive-scale voter fraud, chaffetz did say he saw no evidence of that, but he also added that trump was free to use the department of justice to investigate. when a reporter asked whether that might be wasteful, and whether chaffetz could do an investigation on that waste, he shrugged.
this is one of the many areas in which undoing the law would be a lot more complicated than it sounds.
one sign of this is that he's suddenly being levelheaded at turns ― which might be even scarier than his raging impulsiveness. there's a new, more pragmatic trump swallowing his pride and backing gop candidates who voted against his agenda or who have pointed to his offensive and destructive actions and twitter rantings.
alito at one point suggested that women who work for small employers, and who thus must buy policies on the exchanges, somehow frustrate the government's desire to give all women access to free contraception. verrilli set him straight immediately.
so let's recognize the 44th anniversary of roe vs. wade by continuing our work to improve the availability of medically accurate information and affordable healthcare. health, safety, and access are something all people deserve.
at that point, the supreme court grabbed it, presumably to put the matter to rest once and for all. it is impossible to know which justices voted to take the case (it takes only four) or why.

and then trump actually did something about it, bullying the company at rallies and then helping to strike a deal between carrier and the state government that would keep the factory in operation in exchange for some tax credits.

durbin's line of questioning began with an issue that he has long promised to bring up, stemming from kavanaugh's 2006 confirmation hearing for his post on the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit.
that landscape is less certain now. aetna and humana have cut back obamacare enrollment for 2017 after losses, and president donald trump and fellow republicans are weighing a repeal and replace path for obamacare.
in response to whether democrats would try to get mueller to make conclusions that his report specifically avoided — like, for instance, whether trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he wasn't the president — jayapal said democrats might attempt to ask him some of those questions.
one exception is courtney callaway, an omaha-based broker for prime choice insurance. although callaway knows that the ministries work well for a lot of people, she won't sell them because she doesn't think she can stand behind them with the confidence she has in traditional insurance policies. to me it's too dangerous, callaway told huffpost. it's not insurance.

the most dramatic break came last year, when collins voted to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court. reproductive rights supporters were especially dismayed by collins' vote, since it put in place a conservative majority that could overturn roe v. wade or, at the very least, dramatically weaken abortion rights in the country. collins had also voted to confirm conservative neil gorsuch to the supreme court in 2017, and she's been a reliable vote to confirm trump judges to lower courts who have anti-abortion records.
the possibility of that happening should concern everyone, regardless of age. if you can't find affordable nursing home care for a loved one, that care falls to family caregivers ― and maybe you.

everybody, i think, knows that paul ryan does not have president trump's best interests at heart, right? boyle said monday morning on breitbart news' sirius radio show. he tried to undermine him repeatedly during the course of 2016, even after he was the republican nominee for president. paul ryan did nothing to help president trump win on november the 8th. nothing. nothing. and since then has been repeatedly trying to co-opt and destroy the trump agenda.
another big factor in michigan ― again, common to the states where obamacare is working best ― seems to be the health care landscape that existed even before the law took effect. as marianne udow-phillips, director of the ann arbor-based center for healthcare research and transformation, explained to me recently, local and predominantly nonprofit insurers like blue cross, hap and priority dominate the state. the only national insurers that have thrived in michigan are companies like molina that specialize in insuring medicaid patients and have done so for years.
despite what you're hearing about medicare for seniors being weakened, the truth is exactly the opposite, sanders said on wednesday. it will be strengthened.
this move by the trump administration to take away health care will prove far more detrimental to the administration and the republican party than any gains they might have made by the issuance of attorney general william barr's letter summarizing the findings of mueller's investigation, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) said tuesday.
some 49% of republican and republican-leaning independents who voted for trump in 2016 said they consider themselves more supporters of trump than of the republican party. just 19% said they were more supporters of the party, with another 28% saying they were supporters of both.
a: the energy behind medicare for all is a credit to sanders and his allies, some of whom, like physicians for a national health plan, have been at this for decades.
it was there that mekelburg's life took an unusual turn. in november 2005, only a few blocks from where mekelburg and siino lived, a young woman who worked as a stripper was stabbed to death in an apartment, her throat slashed so viciously that she was nearly decapitated. police found a bloody fingerprint on the wall and arrested the victim's on-and-off boyfriend, paul cortez, a handsome aspiring actor who worked as a personal trainer at a neighborhood gym. a jury found cortez guilty of second-degree murder. in march 2007, he was sentenced to 25 years to life.
bain capital recently elicited scrutiny for its role in the bankruptcy of toys r us, which it bought with other private equity firms and saddled with debt. the company's collapse this year put 33,000 retail workers out of a job, and they are now demanding $70 million in severance from bain and the other private equity firms.
in reality, requirements that insurers sell to anybody, regardless of medical condition and at uniform prices, would come off the books if the affordable care act went away. so would requirements that all policies cover 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity and prescription drugs.
the differences among the candidates is in how they would address these problems. medicare for all would wipe away existing insurance arrangements and enroll everybody into a new government-run plan, with essentially zero out-of-pocket costs. the financing would come through some kind of taxes, but the idea is that most people would end up spending less money ― in many cases, a lot less ― than they do today. the new system would also be simpler for both patients and providers, especially when it comes to billing.
the affordable care act bolstered medicare in several ways, most obviously by gradually eliminating a gap in prescription drug coverage, known as the doughnut hole, that left seniors on the hook for especially high out-of-pocket costs. without the affordable care act in place, the doughnut hole would open back up.
i have always voted, but not been active politically with the party, she said. i was a fellow in hillary's campaign. volunteered in the local office, phone banks, etc. now i'm a member of the south of dayton democratic club, i'm organizing a no hate group, i have a group i email to keep them informed of opportunities to be involved. the first thing i do every morning is send emails to congressmen and make phone calls to [sen. rob] portman and [rep. mike] turner.
new mexico also made headway in criminal justice reform. the state banned the box ― prohibiting employers from including a question on job applications about an applicant's criminal history ― and legislators are considering barring jail officials from putting juveniles, pregnant women and inmates with serious mental disabilities in solitary confinement. new mexico also decriminalized drug paraphernalia (the first state in the country to do so) and small quantities of marijuana.
it could also be a tragedy for the millions of people who depend on the affordable care act for health insurance because of a lawsuit that the supreme court is scheduled to hear on nov. 10.
lucas' health is good now. he gets exams every two years to make sure his heart is healthy, and he takes some generic prescriptions for his high blood pressure.
of course, wraparound services and other forms of prep outreach aren't necessarily cheap; widespread use of prep among black msm will likely come with a much higher overall price tag than for their white peers.

reports suggest lawmakers may scrap several controversial riders in an effort to get the bill passed before midnight on friday, when funding for the government is set to dry up. progress on the bill, which provides over a trillion dollars in funding, has been stymied by disagreements over president donald trump's border wall and other several hot-button issues.
that leaves us with november, and with turning out the vote of those who believe in what's right while fighting voter apathy and voter suppression ― not to mention russian bots ― as we push back against those who might be energized in trump's base, high on a toxic brew of hate and paranoia.
maybe that helps explain what bevin actually proposes to do now. on medicaid, bevin has talked about requiring beneficiaries to pay more for their care, not taking their coverage away from them.
gina santoro's boyfriend was apprehended three days after her death and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. there were other criminal prosecutions in the pre-roe era as well, mostly for aiding in the procurement of an abortion, almost never of the patient herself.
trump, meanwhile, urged republican senators at a weekly caucus lunch to again embrace the issue of health care ahead of the 2020 election.
sen. elizabeth warren (mass.) said if she were elected, she would commit to making sure labor leaders had a place in her administration.
wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who i promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps. the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. african-american, hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. more people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.
fox news' laura ingraham summed it up: the america we know and love doesn't exist anymore. massive demographic changes have been foisted on the american people … that none of us ever voted for and most of us don't want. in case anyone missed the point, she added: this is related to both legal and illegal immigration.
one of the ironies of the republican attack on the affordable care act is it's made it more popular in voters' eyes, especially as voters have a chance to compare the affordable care act to the republican alternatives, garin said.
i worked from home at jobs i chose. thanks to obamacare, the only anxiety-producing thing in my life was that the liberal ideals i'd campaigned for since high school had just been crushed, just when i'd finally let myself believe that a highly competent woman would win the day. the fact that she did not prevail over such an ignoramus was not something i could discuss lightly.
with the white house recently estimating that the true cost of the opioid epidemic topped $500 billion in 2015, critics have accused the administration of dedicating insufficient attention and resources to the crisis. even during his address on tuesday, trump spent far more time discussing other issues, including a handful of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants over the past few years.
in total, according to estimates by the urban institute, 20 million people would lose health insurance. many, many more would lose protections ― like a prohibition on annual or lifetime benefit limits ― they might need in case of catastrophic medical issues.
for instance, kentucky last year proposed work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance and establishing new fees for all members based on income. a study found the proposal would reduce the number of residents on medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.
senator mccaskill cast the deciding vote for obamacare that created the healthcare system mess, kelli ford, a spokeswoman for hawley's campaign, wrote in an email. prescription drug prices have skyrocketed, millions have lost their health insurance plans, premiums have doubled, and claire mccaskill has done nothing to fix the problem she created.
they're self-identifying and self-gathering, pastorek added, stressing that all this energy is organic. they're not waiting for the democratic party to tell them what to do. they're doing it themselves, and it's great.
stephanopoulos: you're trying to strike down the whole law. trump: george, we have run it really well. but we also have now other … we have other alternatives to obamacare that are 50% less expensive, and they're actually better. stephanopoulos: it's been 3½ years. trump: george, it's been 40 years since you had good health care ― you've never really had good health care in this country. this country has never had it.
more than 12 hours after the second day's proceedings began, judge brett kavanaugh has been dismissed for the evening.
during those eight years of the obama administration, i would watch the unconditional love for obama slowly begin to disappear, beginning with the battle over health care for all americans—obamacare. i observed the indisputable sound and fury of white people, including angry white men in the united states congress, declare war on the president.
trump and other republican leaders have been promising that their plans would somehow not hurt americans, but the gop is unwilling to spend the money required to provide benefits to this many people.
if i needed another heart procedure all of a sudden and i was on one of those plans again, i'd be very scared, said blackshear, who currently is covered by a policy from the aca's exchange. though imperfect, he said, the policy is reliable, and he hasn't had trouble getting the insurance to cover his annual electrocardiograms, cardiologist visits and blood work.

as a result, trump's plan would dramatically increase the number of people who would be uninsured by scrapping obamacare and making cuts to medicaid. that's despite trump's repeated assurances that when he's president, nobody will die in the streets due to lack of health care. there's nothing about guaranteeing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, either, even though he has expressed vague support for these protections in the past.
long before trump entered politics, romney had clearly established his propensity for flip-flopping. in his first run for public office against then-sen. ted kennedy (d) in 1994 and later in his successful 2002 race for governor of massachusetts, romney declared himself a strong supporter of abortion rights – a requisite position for any republican hoping to win office in new england. in both races, romney cozied up to planned parenthood to demonstrate his pro-choice commitments.
but gross' background as a health care reform advocate carries political risks, as well as advantages.
those concerns would be moot in president-elect donald trump's version of the obamacare repeal and replace, where those actions would happen essentially simultaneously. (most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day ― could be the same hour, trump said wednesday, evidently believing in an alternate universe where congress works like that.)
spicer, nevertheless, said the office's analysis ought to be taken with skepticism. their record is what i'm calling into question. when you look at the number of people and the cost on what they scored the last obamacare bill on, it's way off, spicer said.
a health services research journal report found that when a rural area's only hospital closes, income per capita falls by 4 percent and unemployment rises by 1.6 percent.

dinkin, of the working families party, would not say that warren should herself go on the attack against buttigieg. but he predicted that buttigieg will have to answer for his presence at the tea party event.
but the sicker population making up these exchange marketplaces doesn't seem to be getting balanced out by healthier customers who pay into the insurance risk pool without drawing down as much in benefits. absent that balance, health insurance companies will raise rates further in future years to cover their costs, which could price out consumers -- especially those who are healthy and who need coverage least and thus are the least costly to insure.
i do not believe the house has met its burden of showing that the president's conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office, collins said on tuesday, echoing other republicans who argued that trump's conduct, while wrong, didn't merit his conviction.
spicer himself used to be much more trusting of congressional budget office numbers, when they suited his previous bosses' agendas.
democratic national convention via associated press former secretary of state john kerry speaks via video during the second night of the democratic national convention on tuesday.
this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
trump voters' support for trump has remained relatively consistent over that time.
the political problem for republicans is that voters aren't likely to believe they suddenly care about pre-existing conditions, just because they say they do.
mekelburg, who declined multiple requests from huffpost to comment, has managed to keep almost all of her personal information off the internet. the 45-year-old resident of fishkill, new york, grew up in a jewish family in east brunswick, new jersey, a fairly affluent community not far south of new york city. her father owns a wholesale business called mekelburg co. that sells magnets, keychains and assorted gimcrackery. her brother runs a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in brooklyn that also bears the family name.

those experts aren't the only ones weighing in on the case. organizations representing pretty much every major stakeholder in health care ― from patient advocacy groups to physicians ― have filed briefs warning of the dire consequences if the 5th circuit judges rule for the plaintiffs.
lawmakers in iowa did this last year, with legislation that permits the state's farm bureau to sell health plans that operate just like normal insurance policies ― collecting premiums, paying hospital bills and so on ― but are exempt from both state and federal insurance rules. this means the plans don't have to include all the aca's essential benefits, and the farm bureau can deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

i think it's hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down, roberts said. congress left the rest of the law intact. ... that seems to be compelling evidence on the question.
congressional leaders have agreed on a spending bill to keep the government open, and deep inside that agreement is a provision that helps explain why american health care is so expensive.
she acknowledged she's not so naive to think that everyone in her state party is pleased with her. but that's okay.
more than 100 house democrats pleaded with health and human services secretary alex azar for a special enrollment period for the coronavirus outbreak in a letter, as did nine senate democrats in a letter to majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) and minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.).
biden's plan also has a public option. specifically, it would create a new, government-run insurance plan that would be available to anybody who wanted to enroll in it. critically, this new plan would be open to low-income people residing in states like florida, georgia and texas where officials have refused to participate in the affordable care act's medicaid expansion.

you have to have an honest conversation about that and what those monuments symbolize, but what they also do is trigger 400 years of trauma for black communities, she said, adding, the localities where they are need to decide if they want to take them down. they should be able to take them down, or we at the commonwealth level should do so as well.
mcsally, meanwhile, is preparing to remind voters of sinema's past as a liberal state legislator and left-leaning activist. she told her volunteers she has the perfect contrast ready, referencing a photo of sinema in a pink tutu protesting the iraq war.
when trump threatened north korea on twitter, mccain critiqued the move by saying, i don't think that's a way you attack an issue and a challenge like this. of trump's performance at the nato summit in 2018, mccain said it was disappointing, yet ultimately unsurprising. after trump congratulated russian president vladimir putin on his election victory, mccain noted, an american president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.
in addition to requiring players to use their real names, learned league also lists its users' gender, location and college. which is how we know that user mulvaneym, who, remarkably, has never missed a day of questions, is a male from lancaster, south carolina, who attended georgetown university and chose a shamrock as his user flag.
if the effect of repealing the individual mandate is not included, the tax rates for low- to middle-income americans would decrease, not increase, according to an analysis toomey and other republicans asked jct to conduct — though the decreases would still not be as much as the rate reductions for wealthy payers.
mcgrath claimed victory in an email to supporters tuesday afternoon, saying that she was humbled to be your nominee against mcconnell and that she can't wait to get started in sending him into retirement.
medicare for all would basically wipe away existing insurance arrangements, public and private, and replace them with a new government-run insurance plan. the benefits would be comprehensive and more generous than anything you see today, even compared to traditional medicare: it'd cover all medically necessary care, and there would be no out-of-pocket costs except for some token copayments on certain name-brand prescription drugs.
and then there is matt rosendale, the republican candidate who running against two-term incumbent sen. jon tester in montana. rosendale is the state's insurance commissioner, putting him in a unique position not just to talk about health care policy but also to enact it. among his notable actions was last year's decision to reverse a long-standing prohibition on christian health sharing ministries ― which, like the plans trump just approved, have some combination of exclusions for pre-existing conditions, limits on coverage and big gaps in benefits.

mccready isn't running again. democrat cynthia wallace, a black woman with a 25-year history in the financial services industry, is. wallace, like most democrats running in moderate suburban districts, has been focusing on health care, saying she will focus on lowering prescription costs and expanding covid-19 testing if elected.
this is the defining choice facing voters next tuesday.
there are limits to how much improvement, or damage, trump could make to the health insurance exchanges, but there are several key actions that will go a long way to determining whether his administration wants to make the markets work better or worse.
griffin pivarunas for khn uva medical center treated heather waldron in 2017 for complications from an intestinal malformation. the hospital sued her for $164,000 after she discovered her insurance had lapsed. that was more than twice what a commercial insurer would have paid for the same care.

whatever the case's precise trajectory, the law's fate will inevitably come down to some extremely conservative jurists ― including, potentially, some sympathetic to the extremely conservative worldview fox and yost lay out in their brief.
trump was the most audacious of all, repeatedly saying thinks like everybody's got to be covered and, during the transition, assuring a washington post interviewer that he wanted insurance for everybody. polling and interviews have made it clear that many people, including a lot of trump voters, took the promise seriously. if they didn't truly expect everybody to be covered, they at least expected everybody's coverage to be better.
now conservatives and some gop moderates, concerned that republicans don't have a clear plan on how they'll move forward with an obamacare alternative, could team up later this week to take down the first real vote in the house to set up a repeal of the law.

give it a few days, for goodness sake! chaffetz told the huffington post this week. all the flailing before he was even sworn in was a bit silly, if not purely immature.
but for trump and other republicans, using the affordable care act to offer assistance during an emergency would be an admission that the law and its benefits help people. an admission of that sort would blow up the decade-long republican mantra that obamacare is nothing but a train wreck destroying the american health care system.
sen. rand paul (r-ky.) has also strongly suggested he would vote against a motion to proceed on the revised bill no matter the status of cruz's amendment. he called it the same as the old bill, except worse, and, should a motion to proceed fail, he would push senate gop leaders to hold a vote on a straight repeal.
that recognition did not age well. ryan turned out to be as committed to fiscal responsibility as his republican predecessors were ― which is to say, he wasn't very committed at all, as a handful of critics had long warned. (one of them was new york times columnist paul krugman, who in 2010 called ryan a flimflam man.) although he didn't like to advertise it, he too had voted for those deficit-busting proposals of the bush era.

it will be up to the insurers whether to offer renewals and under what conditions, administration officials explained in a conference call on tuesday night. and states will still retain the right to regulate the plans more tightly, whether that means keeping the obama rules in place or prohibiting the sale of short-term plans altogether.

in the case of tax reform, there is time for the rich to show their heart. the last major tax reform bill, signed by president ronald reagan in 1986, took two years to hash out and assemble. and no doubt trump will find the issue more complicated than he imagined. thus the rich have time to organize and lobby for a more equitable tax system. but of course, organizing prowess is the least of it; growing a heart is.
it's not altogether surprising then that the state's voters increasingly do not identify with either major party. while the state has more registered republicans than registered democrats, more people than in either group ― and a majority of alaska's voters ― now choose not to affiliate with any political party, according to official state data.
in that letter, bertolini warned that rejection of the merger by justice department regulators would lead aetna to reduce our 2017 exchange footprint.
democrats are also offering to undo one of the few tax increases republicans implemented in their 2017 tax bill with a provision allowing homeowners to write off state and local taxes (salt) above $10,000. that tax cut would be highly regressive; the tax policy center estimates that the richest 1% of households would receive 56% of the benefit of that change, and the top 5% would get 80%.
biden then pivoted to attacking trump for having a bank account in china, where tax records obtained by the new york times show he has paid more in taxes than in the united states. the move shifted the conversation to uncomfortable terrain for trump as biden pressed him to prove that he has no compromising financial ties in foreign nations by releasing his tax returns.

although the number of uninsured americans has grown because of job losses due to the economic hit of covid-19, the trump administration resisted calls to authorize a special enrollment period for people uninsured in the pandemic. failure to repeal and replace obamacare as he repeatedly vowed to do was one of former president donald trump's most bitter disappointments. his administration continued trying to find ways to limit the program or unravel it entirely. a supreme court decision on trump's final legal challenge to the affordable care act is expected this year.

the bluntest consequences of eliminating the entire law would be the millions of newly uninsured americans. funding for the medicaid expansion would disappear, leaving people with earnings just above the poverty line without access to health care. likewise, the tax credit subsidies that allow customers to buy private insurance on the law's exchange marketplaces would go away, making coverage unaffordable.

one of the things that progressives look at in the affordable care act is that they see something like the medicaid expansion as the most successful part of the law precisely because it was unafraid to circumvent the private insurance industry. you talked about those 22 house republicans who voted against repeal and the three in the senate ― it was basically because of medicaid expansion, and that was the most progressive part of the law.

it also helps, udow-phillips says, that so many of michigan's insurers are nonprofits with histories of citing the public good as part of their missions.
mccaskill, on the campaign trail, has defended the law – but also admitted passing it on a party-line vote was a mistake.

medicaid expansion: the bill includes a phase out of the medicaid expansion, via a freeze in eligibility for obamacare's enhanced 90% federal share of medicaid costs for new enrollees beginning in 2020. this phase-out would likely take at least 2-5 years to be effective once implemented in 2020.

the fallout from the title x gag rule could be significant. in some states, like alaska, connecticut, minnesota and utah, planned parenthood manages the title x networks. in some rural areas, it's the only provider for communities to receive family planning services.
tom williams via getty images senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has reopened the quest for the holy grail of republican government: cutting medicare, medicaid and social security to pay for tax cuts.
both the sanders bill and a house counterpart from rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) envision enrolling nearly everybody in a single, newly created government insurance plan that would control payments to all parts of the health care system, including for hospitals. sanders would make this transition in four years, jayapal in two.
other justices, other factors that could matter
protections for people with pre-existing conditions would vanish. initiatives to improve hospital quality would stop. rules for calorie counts at restaurants would no longer be in force.
steyer's ad campaign may have a much stronger impact on black voters as two of his rivals — sens. kamala harris of california and cory booker of new jersey — have dropped out of the presidential race in recent months. the two senators, both of whom are black, failed to gain traction, despite strong outreach to south carolina voters from both campaigns, which hoped to recreate the 2008 primary success of former president barack obama.
but the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out of the medicaid expansion, leaving those with incomes between those two thresholds with no source of coverage. in states like idaho, they're effectively too poor for obamacare.
instead, they fall back on policy choices that would make cheap, bare-bones coverage more available to people in good health, but only by making comprehensive coverage more expensive for those who need or want it.
durbin probed if her strict adherence to originalism means a president could not unilaterally deny the right to vote based on race, noting restrictions on mail-in ballots being erected in several states before nov. 3.
early versions of the legislation democrats debated in 2009 and 2010 envisioned subsidies that were both more generous and available to more people. had that kind of legislation passed, many fewer people would be struggling with premiums today.
on thursday, to his credit, chaffetz did take a hard stance against the administration. earlier in the day, kellyanne conway promoted ivanka trump's clothing line during a morning fox news hit from the white house. later in the day, chaffetz said the endorsement was clearly over the line and unacceptable. he and cummings eventually sent a scolding letter referring conway to the office of government ethics for an investigation.
the threat to do away with obamacare is once again on the rise nearly 10 years after it was passed, as a major challenge to the health care law got a sympathetic-sounding hearing in a federal appeals court this week.
jonathan ernst / reuters president donald trump addresses a crowd of electrical contractors. trump's celebration of blue-collar workers was a key part of his appeal in 2016, but he hasn't governed accordingly.
texas v. azar, as this latest lawsuit is known, comes from republican officials representing 20 states. it asserts that, by eliminating the financial penalty for people without insurance as part of the 2017 tax cut, congress removed the health care law's constitutional underpinning.

washington ― the democratic congressional campaign committee raised a record-breaking $31 million in the first quarter of the year, the house democrats' campaign arm announced on friday.
but even with california officials trying so hard to make the affordable care act work, lots of people have struggled with the cost of insurance. among them are residents who make just a little too much income to qualify for the law's financial assistance ― that is, anybody making more than four times the poverty line, which today works out to about $50,000 a year for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four.
barren of ideas for helping its base voters, it resorted to blame-shifting and scapegoating -- of government, obama, illegal immigrants, muslims and other minorities. instead of looking forward, the party indulged a primal nostalgia for simpler times, an imaginary white folks' paradise which can never be resurrected.
nelson said he spoke with vice president mike pence and other white house staff about putting together a bipartisan infrastructure bill. the response he received from them was very good, nelson said.
legal experts view the underpinnings of the lawsuit dubiously, but its outcome is a lot more uncertain now that trump has nominated conservative amy coney barrett to succeed justice ruth bader ginsburg on the supreme court. democrats argue barrett, who has argued against obamacare in the past, is part of a republican plan to kill protections for people with preexisting conditions.
nobody disputes the need for action. federal tax credits available through healthcare.gov can discount insurance deeply, and it's one reason that the number of people without insurance plunged, in kansas and the u.s. as a whole, after the affordable care act took full effect in 2014.
trump is leading in iowa among republicans with only a day to go before the caucuses, according to a bloomberg/des moines register/selzer poll released late saturday. twenty-eight percent of those polled said trump was their first choice, compared to 23 percent who plan to support cruz.
they both realize how vulnerable they are, and how desperate their situation could become, if the supreme court invalidates the aca. if shit hits the fan, we'll probably be the first people to not make it, rice said. it's a frightening time.
on jan. 3, i woke up completely blind in my left eye. it was the start of a horrific three months. in addition to what i learned was a blood clot causing my blindness, i also had numerous severe complications of my disease throughout my body. it was abundantly clear that i was critically ill; my family was called and the faculty banded around me in the hospital.
ryan's plan, released last week with much fanfare, calls for repealing almost all of the affordable care act and replacing it with a mix of small-ball measures, like setting up high-risk pools for people with costly illnesses and raising premiums for older consumers to lower rates for younger adults. in some cases, it would allow health insurers to return to the practice of denying insurance to people with pre-existing conditions.
we're scheduled to break even in 2017, and 2016 was close to that, lolli said. we did not experience the kinds of losses they had elsewhere, not even close. we're on a good path and we think we can be in this for the long haul.
some democrats took mcconnell's remarks as a step toward their preferred solution. sen. bill nelson (d-fla.) said it represented a path forward that is enormously smoother.
hopp and brase said the limits are well-known to those who sign up and are part of the price of being a member.

several months ago, obama and biden agreed that it would be best if the former president did not endorse any candidate early in the primary, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation, meaning biden will be running as an obama-biden democrat without obama's explicit backing. the person with knowledge of obama and biden's discussion, as well as several biden advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity in order to disclose private conversations.
the catch is that these steps would entail new taxes, new regulations, or both ― steps that the trump administration and its allies oppose. that is why officials have settled, instead, on a strategy of letting insurers offer policies that simply don't provide the same level of protection ― and aren't as widely available ― as comprehensive coverage.
the obama administration sought $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the bugs and the virus. the senate passed a compromise measure in may for $1.1 billion, but republicans in the house insisted on adding riders to that bill targeting planned parenthood, the clean water act and obamacare, as well as protecting the display of the confederate flag. democrats refused to back the modified bill in july, and both sides continue to blame the other.
the tax credits are also refundable, which means that if your income tax liability is smaller than the value of the credit, or if you have no liability at all, you still get the full value. this is very important in health care because a large number of people buying through exchanges are working in low-paying jobs. they are hotel housekeepers and clerks at big-box stores, home health aides and security guards. if the credits weren't refundable, they wouldn't get much or any assistance, even though they are the ones who need it most.

the more incremental approaches other democrats, including biden, have proposed vary from candidate to candidate. but in general they seek to make the affordable care act's financial assistance more generous and, then, to create a new, government-run program open to anybody who wants to enroll. most of these plans also envision some form of automatic enrollment for lower-income americans for whom coverage would basically be free.
all of this is taking place in a political environment increasingly hostile for republicans. angry constituents are flooding lawmakers' town halls demanding more details about the replacement plan, while polling shows a marked upswing in public approval for the affordable care act and a notable decline in support for repeal.
however, boyle reportedly told colleagues last week that there are no sacred cows in war ― meaning the site would even attack republicans if they strayed from breitbart's brand of populist, nationalist conservatism. he has interviewed several republicans who are concerned with or opposed to the health care bill, including former alaska gov. sarah palin and sen. rand paul (r-ky.).
it will be fascinating to see just what advances are made in the coming years.
from the start of trump's presidency, his staff and entire administration have had trouble dealing with trump's tendency to say untrue and inflammatory things generally, but particularly on twitter, which trump jealously defends as his sure-fire method of getting his unfiltered message out to his supporters.
and now new york sen. chuck schumer hopes he can persuade abrams to join sinema in congress' upper chamber. schumer and nevada sen. catherine cortez masto have met with abrams, hoping to get her to challenge gop sen. david perdue, a trump favorite and former ceo who is running for a second term in 2020.

out of 100 members in the senate, she's the only one that's really wearing the balls right now, carroll knutson, a 74-year-old republican resident of soldotna, alaska, told huffpost during a reporting trip to the state in 2017, right after her vote against obamacare repeal. i don't know if you can put that in your story.
over the race's final days, booker hit mcgrath for being a pro-trump democrat, an allegation based on an earlier comment in which she'd blamed mcconnell for standing in the way of parts of trump's agenda, and for choosing not to attend protests over taylor's killing.
but if people who buy short-term policies get seriously ill, they could end up spending a lot more money on medical care than they would with a comprehensive policy under the affordable care act, because they'll be paying out of pocket for services such as mental health care, maternity care or prescription drugs that short-term plans frequently don't cover completely or simply don't cover at all.

khn analyzed virginia civil case records from both the district and circuit courts from july 2012 through june 2018, based on the date a case was filed. these case records were acquired from ben schoenfeld, a volunteer for code for america, a nonprofit focused on improving government technology. schoenfeld compiles court records that are available directly from virginia's court system (from both circuit and district courts) and posts them on the website virginiacourtdata.org.

there is usually no financial incentive to filing a complaint, though a company can be required to provide backpay if it fired a worker or cut her hours due to pumping, or withheld pay for normally paid breaks. that was the case with a wawa convenience store in bethlehem, pa., which had to reinstate and pay nearly $5,000 to one breastfeeding mom who'd been terminated. but most workers are rarely owed anything but an accommodation under the federal law.
when trump or the congress allocates grant money ― 'here's a billion or two billion in grants' ― and then cuts medicaid or destabilizes the exchanges, they're actually cutting money for addiction treatment, humphreys, who served in the obama administration, said. you can act like you are doing great work, but what you are doing is gutting the system.
things were bleak at carson's campaign headquarters on super tuesday. asked by the huffington post to clarify whether he would drop out, carson simply replied, we'll see.
there's no shortage of agenda items for the new congress that's just been seated in washington. but lost among the anguished cries to reopen the government and enact ethics reform will be a lesser-advertised but crucial item: addressing major problems in the 2017 tax bill that president donald trump signed into law a year ago.
the backlash was strong: polls showed gop repeal proposals were among the most unpopular legislative efforts in decades. and it doesn't look like the voters haven't forgotten. it is almost certainly a big reason the electoral prospects for democrats look as promising as they do.
rep. john garamendi (d-calif.) said he was not at all frustrated with the priority the aca had taken over medicare for all.
the original plan on medicare, under the affordable care act, was for the doughnut hole to close in 2020. last year, congress passed a law that moved up the timeline so that it would close in 2019. but that legislation was a modification of the affordable care act, and it's not clear what would happen to a law modifying a law that, years after enactment, the courts determine is become unconstitutional.
romney's win-at-any-cost approach has marked his entire career, and it is surely the fire behind his attacks on trump.
through serve america pac, he has some major wins under his belt, foremost among them the march special election victory of conor lamb, a fellow marine who defied the odds in a pennsylvania congressional district that donald trump won by nearly 20 percentage points.
and he felt confident there would be some state and local government funding ― at least in some form. (pelosi said this week that congress may have to provide that aid in stages: first to states, then to local governments and municipalities.)
the hearing kicked off with chaos tuesday as democrats demanded more time to review 42,000 pages of documents from kavanaugh's time working in president george w. bush's white house. theirs wasn't the only coordinated dissent in the room ― protesters also disrupted the proceedings.

as someone who is proud to have called manhattan home since birth, but who also currently belongs to the summer intern demographic, i was forced by the sudden, sweeping arrival of my peers to renegotiate my relationship with the city. the manhattan of the summer interns was only slightly less of a bubble than is the college campus, and it was easy to get tunnel vision. i know from twenty-one years of experience that the city is so much more than a smoggy, sweaty, summer-smothering inferno, it's more than wall street, and it's more than its top five most instagrammable restaurants. and yet, my time did seem to condense into a consciousness marked only by the pendulum that swings between the workweek and the weekend. few people have captured this rhythm as well as mark sebastian in his repetitive chorus for the lovin' spoonful's hit summer in the city. the song's depiction of struggling to 'make it' in greenwich village in the heat of july is as accurate today as it was then in 1966. this summer's college interns were hardly the first and certainly not the last to feel discouraged, drenched in sweat, on the streets of manhattan. it is only through being absorbed within the tiny intern world that have i been able to fully understand this greater, so often clichéd truth: perseverance in the face of obstacles is what the city is all about. that, if nothing else, is something that every intern can be proud to have taken part in.
looking away and pretending it's not there, while peeking through the drapes, doesn't stop kitty genovese from getting butchered.
house conservatives are adamant that any repeal bill take away the expansion, which increased free or low-cost medicaid coverage for people making less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level ― about $16,000 a year for a single person. the house freedom caucus voted monday night to oppose any repeal bill that was not as aggressive as the one the house and senate passed in 2015. that bill gutted the medicaid expansion.
the gop's senseless war on planned parenthood is only part of it. how many of us know that, due to draconian laws sponsored by republicans, 90 percent of american counties have no legal abortion provider? how many of us have stopped to consider that no healthy family needs gop-sponsored parental consent laws, which in authoritarian, abusive and incestuous families can lead to the murder of a daughter?
i voted against the affordable care act, better known as obamacare, because it was taking insurance away from millions of georgians, perdue said wednesday in defense of ossoff's attacks. this is exactly what i'm talking about. he'll talk about anything except his own accountability and his own responsibility.
by the budget center's calculations, a family of four making $50,000 would pay $67 a month in premiums for a standard plan, instead of an average of $252 currently, while also qualifying for help with deductibles and copays. the boost in premium assistance would be available for this year and for 2022.

normally, congress also relies on the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation to assess how much money its tax proposals will either add to or take away from the treasury. in 2017 the jct issued 27 reports, but republicans eschewed the panel's advice on the big question of whether the proposed tax cuts would generate any economic growth to partially offset the trillions of dollars in lost revenue.
meanwhile, harrison's campaign has engaged in some political jujitsu by attempting to elevate bill bledsoe, a conservative constitution party candidate who dropped out of the senate race in early october, but whose name still appears on the ballot. in television and digital ads, harrison's campaign attacked bledsoe as too conservative for the state and overly friendly with trump.
on thursday, three career attorneys from the department of justice asked to remove themselves from the case. that is highly unusual, leaving legal observers like bagley to speculate that the lawyers may have felt they could not in good conscience sign onto the brief.
trump famously celebrated that vote in the rose garden, with house republicans as his guests. this is a great plan, he said.
in a closed-door meeting on the day of the vote, mcsally reportedly stood up and told colleagues that it was time to get this fucking thing done.
so guess what? i had a great time and met some awesome guys, who were also interested in meeting someone who was healthy, active and on the spiritual path. (for real!)
down in page county, in rural southwest iowa, party member christine adcock said that four times the normal crowd showed up to the first county meeting after the election ― a whopping 20 people!! adcock followed up a week later with an update: the february meeting drew 30.
one reason democrats are leaning heavily on this argument is the difficult senate map before them and the need to find issues, like defending pre-existing conditions, that resonate with independents and even some republican voters. this year, democrats are defending seats in 10 states that president donald trump carried in 2016, and one of their best opportunities to pick up a new seat is in arizona, another state that trump won.
sanders envisions moving all people into the new government insurance program over the course of four years. that is a key difference between his bill and the latest version of house medicare for all legislation, which rep. pramila jayapal introduced in february and which calls for a transition of just two years.
biden has not yet said much specifically about policy and, following reports that he was crafting a climate change proposal that would appeal to donald trump voters, rejected suggestions that he was looking for a middle road. but biden has also said he still believes in bipartisan reform, sounding an awful lot like the 2008 candidate who predicted republicans would be more reasonable once bush was out of office.
today, people who buy coverage through healthcare.gov, a state-run analogue like covered california, or directly from insurers no longer have to worry that prospective insurers will treat them differently or deny them coverage because they have diabetes or cancer. they also know the policies they buy will cover a set of 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity care, and prescription drugs, paying for pretty much anything that might be associated with a major illness or injury.
in the end, mcgrath won handily in many of kentucky's rural counties, as well as in some suburban areas.
experts who actually study health care and labor markets said all along that such a shift to part-time work would be unlikely, in part because employers still had lots of incentive to offer company health plans. and research since the affordable care act's full implementation has mostly backed up that intuition.
republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. but kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. the new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. in the 1990s, the republican congress and democratic president bill clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.
if congress had wanted to repeal the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions of the law, it would've done so ― but it didn't, nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan, told huffpost.
the court's reputation would be shattered, as would the public's faith in democracy, the newspaper wrote on monday. cementing a conservative majority on the court is not worth such a price.
house democrats are proposing a number of common-sense ideas to help combat the actual coronavirus pandemic. they aim to pour money into hospitals, and they want to expand health care benefits past the free coronavirus testing congress passed in march.
thus far, the united states of care's modest body of work reflects this mission. the group's first paper is a nine-page primer on efforts to expand health insurance coverage in massachusetts, vermont, colorado, california and nevada. the pamphlet analyzes what made each effort fail or succeed from a policy and political perspective. for example, it claims that the single-payer bill that passed the california senate last year faced political opposition because of the lack of a concrete plan to finance it.
oh, great, now this - jonathan cohn: president donald trump said on friday morning that if senate republicans can't get behind their leadership's health care bill, then they should just repeal the affordable care act right away and work on its replacement later. trump made the suggestion in a tweet. as always, it's difficult to know how seriously to take the comment ― or whether to take it seriously at all…. trump's tweet seemed to be endorsing an idea that sen. ben sasse (r-neb.) floated minutes earlier on fox news and, according to the the wall street journal, in a formal letter to the white house ― that if senate leaders can't assemble a majority by july 10, they should try a different strategy: vote to repeal the bill outright, or at least strip its funding, and then spend a month in non-stop hearings and negotiations to hammer out a deal on a new coverage scheme. [huffpost]
mulvaney (or someone who shares his name, alma mater, hometown, irish pride and at least one acquaintance) appears to be a member of learned league, an online, invite-only trivia competition that pits players against each other over the course of each 25-day-long season. a player's first season is free, while the next year's worth of seasons costs $30. each business day of the season, users go head-to-head with another player in their assigned league to answer six fill-in-the-blank trivia questions from a number of categories as they attempt to rise through the ranks.
at this point, the idea is for republicans to just pass this smaller repeal ― which will likely get rid of the individual and employer mandates, as well as a medical devices tax ― and enter into a conference with the house so that republicans can come up with some larger repeal-and-replace measure later.
while biden has avoided directly weighing in on the debate over the 60-vote threshold and other process questions early in his campaign, booker ― who generally shares biden's philosophy about the necessity of working with the gop and combines it with a hearty dose of rhetoric about love and the need to unite the country ― has weighed in. at a progressive summit in d.c. earlier this year, he said filibuster reform was foolhardy because it also protected democratic priorities.
kavanaugh's two daughters, margaret, 13, and liza, 10, did not join their parents for the start of the second day of the confirmation hearing. the girls left early in the first day of the hearing amid continued protests.
people will buy these policies, show up at the hospital for a condition they did not expect, and discover they are not covered. lori wing-heier, director of alaska's division of insurance
title ii – ways and means:
the key thing to watch is whether the trump administration uses the legal dispute as an excuse to cancel payments to insurers and create chaos, or instead tries to work through the legal process and make the payments as planned, larry levitt, senior vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, said on twitter.
maintaining a strong social media presence
it will take a long time to undo the increases in income inequality that we've seen since reagan took office. the obama tax changes, however, are unquestionably a step in the right direction, one that should have a real impact over time. moreover, recent data shows that, in addition to overall wage growth improving, wage growth has been even stronger at lower-income than higher-income levels. according to one measure: on a rolling twelve-month basis, [the past year] marks by far the best relative performance among non-college educated workers going back to 1997.
this is really an indicator of how severe concern 1 is. the higher the cost, the bigger the entitlement, and the greater long-term risk to the federal fiscal condition if things spiral has to be paid for. i) some of this can be covered by using savings from repealing obamacare, but that really just means enacting a republican plan that deficit spends at the same rate as current law. ii) if cost exceeds obamacare spending, than either some of the obamacare taxes must be kept, or new revenues raised in other ways. the released bill includes a further delay of repealing obamacare taxes, likely to produce this necessary revenue.
schumer accused republicans who crossed party lines to support advancing his bill on thursday of doing so merely out political expediency.
both biden and sanders won delegates during the formal nominating process — the first real acknowledgment of the party's heated primary process. biden easily surpassed the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, while sanders fell short with 1,073 delegates.
typically, the online enrollment system was only shut down for a few hours at a time and it was much less frequent than once a week, cnn reported in september 2017, citing former officials.
low-key statements like mcconnell's, though, have tended to get buried in the blizzard of claims trump has made nearly from his first day in office about how successful he has been.
some insurers neither pay or receive much money. but some do. in 2016, florida blue, the state's blue cross and blue shield affiliate, received nearly half a billion dollars in risk adjustment payments. that was equal to about 42 percent of its gross profit in the individual market,so the administration's payment stoppage is major blow (if only temporary).
pocan made a similar point to huffpost on friday, saying there was always going to be frustration from the members who aren't at the negotiating table.
aside from the governor himself, no one did more to cement bevin's status as the least-popular republican governor in the united states than brewer, the public school employee who sparked kentucky's mass mobilization of teachers last year, when thousands of educators responded to bevin's proposed changes to public pensions by calling in sick and shutting down kentucky schools.

the site fivethirtyeight, which tracks how often members of congress vote with trump, found that baldwin is near the bottom ― right along with democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as massachusetts, new york and california.
in the 60 minutes interview with donald trump and mike pence, attempts by correspondent lesley stahl to get insights into pence was noticeably futile.
limiting hospital prices could be pretty difficult
senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) used a procedural rule to force senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) to adjourn the senate for the day in protest of republicans withholding more than 100,000 pages of documents from kavanaugh's records.
on monday, five of them put their protests on paper ― by introducing an amendment to the budget resolution that would push back that jan. 27 date until march 3. repeal and replace should take place simultaneously, and this amendment will give the incoming administration more time to outline its priorities, sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) said. by exercising due diligence we can create a stable transition to an open health care marketplace that provides far greater choice and more affordable plans for the american people.
braun has a simpler job: he just needs to keep pro-trump voters in his corner.
if the trump administration succeeds in its pledge to roll back obamacare, african americans would be particularly vulnerable to the wave of medical disenfranchisement that would devastate the country unless congress passes robust legislation to properly replace the outgoing president's crowning achievement.
and the key to shoring up the health insurance exchanges right now is catering to the carriers, even if those same changes make the law less consumer-friendly.
and the reinterpretation appears to have some limits. a senior labor department official told stephanie armour of the wall street journal, who was first to report on the proposal's substance, that ahps still could not vary premiums based on health status. that seems to be consistent with the regulation's wording.
lord knows just how big a mess betsy devos plans to make of her supposed area of expertise, k-12 education. for now, many of her department's public actions have focused on hurting college students, especially the victims of predatory for-profit colleges. proceeding with her plans to dump obama rules aimed at holding bad colleges accountable, devos's team apparently has also now set its sights on campus sexual assault, that is, on weakening protections against campus sexual assault. since 2014, the department has every week released a list of colleges and universities being investigated for alleged mishandling of sexual violence claims. this week, candice jackson, the acting head of the department's office for civil rights, gave a speech in which she denounced the effort as a list of shame and said the department might soon stop publishing it ― which would make nervous college administrators happy but would weaken accountability and protection of students.
so far, this has been an all-volunteer effort. luke and elena mayville and garrett and emily strizich aren't getting paid. all their funding has come from small donations.
at the beginning of the process the democrats made it very clear they were not going to support anything that guts obamacare, rep. steve scalise (r-la.), the majority whip, said when asked if he'd had any conversations with democratic counterparts. so immediately they said, 'look, if it involves getting rid of obamacare, we don't want to be a part of that discussion.'
but americans are more enthusiastic about proposals to make enrollment in government-run insurance voluntary rather than mandatory. and once americans hear some of the common attacks that conservatives deploy against government-run insurance schemes, they get more skittish about the idea.
sen. susan collins (r-maine), a supporter of the law who helped save it in 2017 when republicans in congress attempted to repeal it, agreed.
but clinton's cynical, dishonest assault on single-payer is consistent with the weird, sinister turn her campaign made at the outset of 2016. earlier this month, clinton attempted to smear sanders as being soft on wall street, suggesting that he doesn't have a plan to take on shadow banking. this is daffy any way you look at it. as we've noted before, sanders favors aggressively breaking up the large financial institutions that engage in shadow banking. he would buttress those efforts by reinstating glass-steagall and hit those shadow banks that remain unaffected with a tax on their transactions.
yuri gripas/reuters democrats think sen. dean heller (r-nev.) is an example of a republican who could be in trouble if the gop's replacement plan for obamacare passes.
coverage is really important if you lose it, responded host chris wallace.
not really sure ... getting shit for not texting/calling every 5 minutes. trying to make me find jesus. no physical, emotional, or intellectual attraction. extremism. putting toilet paper on the roll backwards. that's all that comes to mind. you?
washington ― it took the house months of infighting and a failed first attempt to ultimately pass a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act. more than two weeks later, senate republicans are nowhere near reaching an agreement on a bill of their own.
here is the truth: trump has no idea what he wants to do about the serious flaws in the american health care system. for trump, touting health policy is akin to the teetotaler president telling consumers that trump vodka is great-tasting. he has no clue about either of these things. how could he?
on tuesday, trump ally and newsmax founder christopher ruddy urged the president to ditch conservatives and rekindle the bipartisanship in congress that obama destroyed. ruddy's suggestion: empanel a bipartisan committee to report back by year's end with a feasible plan to fix obamacare.
the political conversation on health care these days is increasingly about the future, especially among progressive activists thinking about how a democratic president and congress could improve the affordable care act or maybe replace it with something better. that makes a lot of sense, given how many people are still struggling with medical bills. but it will be at least two years before major new reforms can become law and, in the interim, health care for some people who already have it will remain in jeopardy.
obama, no matter how noble his campaign, was being propped up to mask the searing racism and economic injustices of our country.
and the tax credits are a work in progress, thune said. a big concern there, he said, is that the house bill ― unlike the affordable care act ― doesn't tailor the tax credits to income, making it a lot harder for the poor and even some middle-class consumers to afford coverage.
patients would pay for care on a sliding scale based on their income, he said. these programs would build on new york city's and new york state's health care safety net, which is more comprehensive than in most states.
barack obama has been 'dad-in-chief' in a way we haven't seen before in the white house, said bravo. he talks openly about the need for fathers to be engaged, but also that women are disproportionately affected by the lack of [family-friendly] policies.
this is, to put it in simple terms, hogwash. and it's the same hogwash trump and the gop have been trying to pour down america's throat for a decade.
i am living proof of how bad it was before the affordable care act. the fact that i am still alive is because i was lucky: as someone in the medical profession, i had numerous doctors who went out of their way to help me for free and then i was able to move to another state where i was covered.
white nationalists, misogynists and neo-nazis all amplified mekelburg's comments about me. so did prominent far-right propagandists such as jack posobiec and mike cernovich, both of whom had been instrumental in driving the near-deadly pizzagate disinformation campaign.
funding those csr payments would be a small step that republicans could take ― with democrats ― to reinforce the obamacare insurance markets. but that move would almost certainly draw the ire of conservatives, and it's unclear what legislative vehicle congress could use for csrs.
it is precisely the problem, verrilli said in response to a question from alito urging a contraceptive-only plan. it's not a less restrictive alternative, because it has precisely the problem congress was trying to overcome in the preventive services provision.
trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top democratic and republican congressional leaders.
grassley asked whether kavanaugh would have a problem ruling against the president who nominated him, a common concern among democrats.
the supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case next month, a week after election day. the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg and barrett's nomination to be her replacement seemingly puts the aca in greater jeopardy.
later in the week, trump gave an hour-long, televised performance hosting a meeting on the plight of some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. democrats and republicans backing a bill protecting their status were stunned a day later, when trump called a much smaller meeting – not televised – where he reversed his earlier position while reportedly refusing to help immigrants from shithole countries like haiti or those in africa.
if trump in fact plans to proceed with a plan to dislodge the notoriously independent members of the house freedom caucus in primary elections, he has his work cut out for him. the members are almost entirely clustered in extremely conservative congressional districts where their ideology-driven stubbornness is a political asset.
this claim is just plain silly since no one is planning on actually paying her the money. she should look up citizens united v. federal election commission for a definition of bribery, a ruling handed down by several justices for whom she voted, and a ruling which she's benefited from in the form of corporate donations.
their appeal to black voters was far from perfect: district of columbia mayor muriel bowser and atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms were both brought on to talk about structural racism, even while protesters in both cities argue their mayors have not done nearly enough to reform their police departments.
inslee then politely explained to mccain that her claims were basically b.s. (though he didn't use that particular term).
she's going to the court, graham said. this is the first time in american history that we've nominated a woman who's unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.
plenty of people who belong to ministries have told reporters how much they like the coverage ― that they appreciate both the savings and the spiritual support, and that it was there for them when they needed it.
a fourth poll from morning consult and politico, released wednesday, finds considerably more positive views of the bill, with 46 percent of voters approving and 35 percent disapproving. while 27 percent don't think the bill goes far enough in changing the health system, according to the survey, 24 percent think it goes too far, and 17 percent that it goes far enough.
ramos pressed biden on president barack obama's deportations of undocumented immigrants and asked him why latinos should trust him. he also challenged biden when he dodged the question. he then turned to castro, the former obama cabinet secretary and the only latino candidate in the field, and asked him why voters should trust democrats to deal with immigration reform since the party failed to do it when it controlled congress and the white house in 2009.
in the years since, however, the law has grown increasingly popular. in kff's latest polling, conducted last month, 49% of americans held a favorable view of the aca, compared to the 42% who viewed it negatively.
where were you when r party refused to use the power of the purse to defund obamacare ? https://t.co/oah1b92pfs — sean hannity (@seanhannity) august 5, 2016
at a government contractor in oklahoma, one worker said she endured the indignity of having her female manager stand outside the nursing room and time her while she pumped. the manager threatened to discipline her if she didn't stop pumping after four months, even though the employee stayed late to make up for her pumping time. she eventually suffered from mastitis. according to the case file, her boss asked her why she was still breastfeeding if she had an infection.
she understands all of georgia, says kenny mullins, an official with a local international brotherhood of electrical workers chapter. she's fighting against tax hikes that are going to hurt guys like me that get up at the crack of dawn to go and work long hours.
earlier this month, mcconnell said he had not been at the white house since august because of its handling of covid-19 precautions.
all of this adds to the evidence that the politics of the issue have changed, turning a one-time strength for republicans into a serious liability. and it could have a big impact come november.
going back to the 2009 debate, the 2010 debate, i think we all agreed on pre-existing conditions, he said. (again, attempts to prevent the passage of obamacare, as well as the yearslong effort to repeal it, contradict roe's claim.)
as veterans choice expands, the confusion around the program that persists among veterans must be addressed with dedicated outreach and education.
if the repeal-and-replace gambit fails, and the public is prepared to blame republicans for ruining the insurance markets, those offers by democrats could start to look pretty good to a president whose entire agenda could be infected by a fatally flawed health care plan.
lamb, who now sits in a safer seat thanks to redistricting but remains wary of trashing trump, cited a tweet where the president promised not to cut medicare or medicaid. and he has tried to cut those things every single year, and it's the democrats in congress who stop him, lamb said.
bernhardt applauded trump for tapping jorjani for the solicitor role, citing his corporate and legal experience.
he actually is moving the numbers in his direction compared to a year ago, in terms of the wall, sen. john thune (r-s.d.) argued tuesday.
and warren has struggled to turn the tables on her centrist rivals. during the last debate, she attacked buttigieg's plan ― which would not provide health insurance for every american ― as medicare for all who can afford it. the line has not caught on. and warren has generally bypassed chances to bash her primary rivals.
more immediately, democrats must figure out how best to meet the needs of a public still very scared of the virus and experiencing financial pain because covid-19 relief has lapsed. and they must do so in a world where ― unless they manage to win both of the coming runoffs in georgia ― republicans control the senate.
being blunt, the only bright spots i've seen have been from groups like brand new congress and crooked media. both are brilliant efforts, but both are also non-representative of the dnc itself. trump has a hundred megaphones through which to reach his base, while most americans have no idea who tom perez is or what hopes he may have for this country.
the response from biden and sanders
for now, it's impossible to be certain
however, a special election, where turnout is typically much lower is a completely different beast, according to robertson.
that would be a massive change from how the program currently works, with federal and state governments together spending whatever it costs to treat beneficiaries. this setup allows medicaid funding to expand during economic downturns and public health emergencies.
the main appeal of medicare for america is its potential to achieve much of what the sanders proposal would, without all the disruption. but medicare for america would still change quite a lot. of the public plan proposals, medicare for america comes closest to medicare for all, says karen pollitz, senior fellow at the henry j. kaiser family foundation.
full repeal of the affordable care act remains a very real possibility if republicans get through the midterm elections with their congressional majorities intact. but even if the law stays on the books, its future will depend heavily on who wields power at the state level ― as governors, insurance commissioners and members of state legislatures.
don't let the schumer clowns out of this web massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess, he added, referring to sen. chuck schumer (d-n.y.), leader of the democrats in the u.s. senate. it will fall of its own weight - be careful!
there are fewer and fewer political incentives to working with republicans as well. recent polling showed two-thirds of americans support the president's relief proposal — a data point that prompted biden's white house chief of staff ron klain to declare the plan bipartisan on its merits, regardless of how republicans actually vote.
biden advisers say it's more than nostalgia that positions the former vice president well in the 2020 campaign. they argue that despite a vocal left flank, the bulk of the democratic party is still in line with many of initiatives of the obama administration, including the overhaul of the nation's federal health care laws and the paris climate accord.
the basis for the claim is that the affordable care act has dramatically increased federal spending, mostly by plowing hundreds of billions of dollars every year into medicaid and tax credits that help people buy private insurance on healthcare.gov or one of the state-based exchanges. but the law's architects also found offsetting revenue and cuts ― they raised taxes on the wealthy, for example, and reduced what medicare pays to hospitals.
when you get sick, why should it affect your education? he asked.
most recently, after exhaustively studying the impact of russia's strategically leaked emails, the esteemed political scientist catherine hall jamieson concluded: it is therefore very likely without russian interventions, donald j trump not be the us's 45th president. russia continues these blatant efforts in 2018: late last month, the doj indicted a russian linked to firms close to putin for investing $10 million in a targeted social media campaign intended to sow division and discord in us political system and thereby influence public sentiment.
it was also the first i heard of an organization called doctors for america (known as doctors for obama at the time), who were fiercely advocating for the aca. as a patient, i felt grateful to see doctors fighting for my health care. as rudolf virchow once said, medicine is a social science. ... the physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor, and the social problems should be largely solved by them. a physician's oath extends beyond those who are lucky enough to see them in their office.
in lieu of the current tax revision, tipirneni proposes making the middle-class tax cuts in the law permanent and expanding them so they reach more people.
while republicans from both chambers managed to report the larger military and veterans appropriations bill out of conference, the result strayed from what had originally passed in the senate. angry democrats pointed to new partisan riders.
he said biden vowed to close down charter schools. biden's plan is skeptical on charters, but would not abolish them entirely.
another ad, from the liberal nonprofit group piedmont rising, attacks north carolina gop sen. thom tillis for rushing an appointment on to the supreme court who will vote to overturn on our healthcare.
but sanders quickly let the topic drop, moving on to discuss his work to improve veterans' health care as the top democrat on the senate veterans affairs committee. in the same answer, he noted he had voted against increases in military spending during the trump administration. that's a potential point of contrast with warren, but he never mentioned her votes to make the contrast clear.
this is partially a result of the relatively short speech times: no one other than the four biggest speakers ― biden, former president barack obama, vice presidential nominee kamala harris and former first lady michelle obama ― had more than 20 minutes to speak.
i don't disagree with where [chapo trap house and other leftist groups are coming from]. i mean, i hesitate to understand why they are criticizing an organization that's three days old. but that's fine. i think the organization will learn from its critics.
under the affordable care act, 37 states expanded medicaid to allow any adults who earn up to 133% of the poverty level, or about $17,000 a year for a single person, to get benefits. voters in missouri and oklahoma approved medicaid expansions this year but the benefits aren't yet available. wisconsin didn't fully expand medicaid but offers coverage to people earning up to the poverty limit, which is about $12,800 a year for a single person.
several recent studies, including two that were released on wednesday morning, examined what the republican approach would mean in practice.
in the end, rand researchers determined, the nyha as designed would reduce overall spending on medical care in new york state. and as long as taxes to pay for the program were sufficiently progressive, the benefits would flow primarily away from the rich and toward lower- and middle-income groups.
asked whether she was disappointed that the national party had not provided more support for her bid, tipirneni responded indirectly.
the unemployment rate remains over 10%, many businesses and jobs are gone for good, experts say the economy will be stuck in a recession for years, trillion-dollar deficits are expected for equally as long, deaths attributed to covid-19 have topped 175,000 and continue rising ― significantly higher than in other developed countries ― testing backlogs persist in parts of the country, and a vaccine is unlikely before the end of the year.
the constituents also booed loudly when reed offered details on what a replacement for obamacare could look like. they jeered when he called the affordable care act a failing system and suggested that a new system would give more americans health savings accounts. most americans can't afford to put aside the money required for these accounts.
it was not hard for jolly to imagine the panic of his fellow members.
for better or worse, biden has instead proposed to bolster the aca by making its financial assistance more generous, by making subsidized insurance available to more people and by creating a public option into which enrollment would be voluntary.

the rising burden of health care costs is unsustainable for patients, families, and taxpayers. we will have to deal with it sooner than later. when that time comes, we will have to take a societal perspective in deciding, based on scientific evidence, what services can be provided for all americans, not just the most affluent among us.
win mcnamee via getty images president donald trump barely mentioned the opioid crisis in his state of the union address tuesday night.
but if you dig into the independent estimates of what either bill would cost, you'll discover that the more optimistic versions ― the ones showing that the programs can pay for themselves and leave most people better off ― frequently assume the new public programs would pay at roughly medicare rates.

farm bureau officials have said they intend to model their policies on the ones in iowa and tennessee, which are relatively generous. one reason the bill is as popular as it is, partisans on all sides agree, is that the farm bureau name carries a lot of weight in kansas, with people accustomed to relying on it for everything from business training to travel discounts. simply put, they trust it.

lesniewski goes on to report that while corker understood the tremendous desire by republicans to just repeal immediately, he was more inclined to trump's point of view, and he pointed to comments by trump that said repeal and replace should be moved simultaneously.

i think she's making a very severe miscalculation of how much cover she has on roe, which is zero, lake said, and how much cover she has [among independents] with king voting the other way. i think she is seriously miscalculating how this will play and also how maine women will respond to it. she's relied on them for her support, and they are not for this nomination. there's a big gender gap.
durbin called trump's intent to dismantle the health care law a cloud — an orange cloud — over her nomination, a political slam at the president's tan.
specifically, it prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because of someone's health status. it requires insurers to pay for treatment of pre-existing conditions once somebody gets coverage. it mandates that all policies include out-of-pocket limits and a comprehensive set of essential benefits that would include coverage for any serious medical problem.
the architects of the 2010 health care law, including president barack obama, understood that it didn't go far enough ― that it didn't cover enough people and that it didn't offer sufficiently good coverage to enough people.
the six-term senator was released earlier this month from the mayo clinic in phoenix following surgery for an intestinal infection.
sen. pat toomey (r-pa.) said he's still studying the bill and that there's a lot i'm not wild about, but the increase in premiums for older americans wasn't one of them.
it's a reflection of how far the party's internal conversation has shifted in the direction of government-run insurance ― even since the 2016 presidential campaign, when sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) made a pure single-payer system the cornerstone of his democratic primary run. it's also a leading indicator of how democrats plan to approach health care as they start thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign.
and when huffpost noted that there wasn't an alternative gop plan, hurd responded, um, there's some piece of legislation, and we can point you to it. thanks, my man.
applications for health coverage would once again require consumers to detail every time they've been sick or injured, going back as far as 10 years, so that insurers could decide whether to issue a policy and how much to charge.
in 1974, there were three broadcast television networks and dozens of major daily newspapers, whose journalists worked on a shared consensus of fact-based reporting. in 2019, there are many fewer newspapers, and instead there are a host of right-wing media outlets, dominated by fox news, that serve to repeat and amplify trump's claims, regardless of their accuracy.
the central issue in the lawsuit is whether, by reducing the affordable care act's individual mandate penalty to zero, trump and the then-gop-controlled congress in 2017 introduced a fatal constitutional flaw into the program — one that requires the courts to wipe it out entirely.
of course, the bill is not all politics.
association health plans could not explicitly discriminate based on health under the proposed new rules. but i have no doubt they would find clever ways of cherry picking healthier people implicitly -- e.g., based on what benefits they cover. — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) january 4, 2018
they did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.
house republicans sued the obama administration in 2014 to halt these payments, arguing the funding needs congressional approval it didn't receive. a federal judge sided with house republicans last year, prompting an appeal from obama's justice department. when trump took office, his administration became the defendant, so he and congressional leaders got the court's permission to delay the proceedings.
last week, we hit pruitt over the revelation that his epa had kicked dozens of respected scientists off the agency's board of scientific counselors. this week it was revealed that pruitt's chief of staff, ryan jackson, pressured the leader of that board, deborah swackhamer, before her scheduled congressional testimony, to play down the dismissals. i was stunned that he was pushing me to 'correct' something in my testimony, swackhamer said. i was factual, and he was not. i felt bullied. lamar smith, the house science committee chair who loves fossil fuel companies as much as pruitt, insisted that jackson did nothing wrong.
republicans do not have a plan because there is no way for them to have a plan. americans want less-expensive health care and less-horrible health insurance. cutting medicaid and medicare and throwing away the health insurance subsidies from the affordable care act will not achieve those results.
the health care law has already survived two supreme court challenges. the first one, from 2012, focused on the same underlying issue in tuesday's case: the individual mandate. writing for a 5-4 majority, roberts upheld the mandate on the grounds that it was a constitutionally permissible use of the federal government's power to levy taxes.
when you feel sick, even before you go to the doctor, where do you look for information? many go to google or other search engines, but that information isn't always reliable. besides, it is often downright scary. and how can anyone trust tv advertisements that promise fields of flowers and happiness to anyone who takes the medication, all while a dispassionate voice-over lists terrible side effects.
addressing roe v. wade, sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) asked how kavanaugh would overturn the notion of judicial precedent in a case, given the judge's previous comments on his commitment to the practice.
bottom line? an internet search can get you started when you need information. but as a patient, you need to know that there are places you can trust to give you the whole story. the more organizations like pcori and icer that we have, the faster we will get to a place in medicine that gives us information we can depend on.

and while pelosi may take an occasional shot or let them down legislatively, they're not airing their grievances publicly ― at least not yet.

hatch made the comments during a speech about the recent gop tax overhaul that repealed the health care law's individual mandate, according to the hill.
the affordable care act, for sure, has its share of worrisome problems. but rather than calling for fixing them or rolling out a plan to achieve its goals of expanded coverage, cost-containment and quality-improvement, trump dismisses obamacare as a failure. undoing the law would create major disruption after years in which it has transformed the health care system, provided coverage to more than 17 million previously uninsured people and trimmed the uninsured rate to historically low levels.
shazam! the next day, my tinder box had several mutual matches. i will stop and say i do love this feature, as it cuts down on the volume of email and uncomfortable feelings around online dating. to be honest, i was shocked, because i had figured tinder for the more visual, less spiritual crowd.
still, in politics, as elsewhere, you don't normally hit a guy while he's down. but jeb was up, in the beginning. and trump realized early there was no narrative for jeb's run, and jeb was schizoid. jeb started as jeb! but surrounded himself with his father's and brother's hacks. jeb continues to be a prop for trump, who initially attacked the awkward (here's the deal) jeb as low energy to contrast with himself -- take-charge (i make good deals) trump. more recently, trump used jeb as a prop for the establishment as he urged voters to compare jeb's faltering $130 million campaign with his own, spending a fraction, but putting him in first place. that's the way a businessman does it.
i'm pretty sure we'll see some plans that are only one or two degrees different from an aca plan, though it'll still be underwritten, so a lot cheaper ― and not available to people with pre-existing conditions, said joel ario, a former commissioner from pennsylvania and oregon who is now a managing director at manatt health. it really opens a pandora's box.
but democrats have a strategic choice they need to make: do they go after the russian contacts component laid out in the first part of the report, or do they focus on the perhaps more solid evidence that trump obstructed justice?
rep. conor lamb (d-pa.), who won a special election in early 2018 in a district trump carried by 20 points, told huffpost that the budget offered a really clear example of a place where he promised one thing in 2016, and he has in fact done the exact opposite.
it is hard not to see in the race for arizona's 8th some of the same elements that propelled democrats to an upset victory in the march 14 special election for pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
this is our future ― our fate ― and our choice to make. i am asking you to choose greatness.
a ruling against the aca would have far-reaching consequences, starting with an estimated 20 million people losing their health coverage. medicaid expansion and health insurance subsidies would disappear, as would extra help for medicare beneficiaries' drug costs and a slew of other things.
several republican lawmakers have said as much. among them is lamar alexander, the retiring senator from tennessee who is chairman of a committee with direct jurisdiction over the health care law. i am not aware of a single senator who said they were voting to repeal obamacare when they voted to eliminate the individual mandate penalty, he said last year.

but the district has changed. it's younger (the median age is 38) and more diverse, with a roughly 30% latino population — communities newman focused on in her campaign. the district is also solidly middle class, with the median household income roughly $66,800, according to the latest census numbers.
worries about these kinds of issues were very much on the minds of some of the state officials who met in boston a week ago, for a gathering of the national association of insurance commissioners.
for years, this writer has advocated for a george washington visionary to step forth from the wall street or corporate sector, one who combines business acumen with a humanitarian feel for his/her fellow citizens, who'd propose the reforms that would put a human face on american capitalism, who'd rebalance america's great experiment of capitalism and democracy ― to bolster the democracy that is faltering and temper the capitalism that is turbo-charged (and, by the way, bolster the usa brand). this visionary risks being called a traitor to his/her class, but also a savior of the nation.
just since this past election, a number of friends have quite suddenly expressed interest in becoming more involved in the party ― many of them have been activists with local environmental groups and in some cases the green party, said sylvia tognetti.
the wealthy will retain slightly lower rates after 2025 mostly because of benefits from the permanent corporate tax cuts, which will increase some kinds of income such as dividends. some of the biggest tax cuts in 2025 are for those earning more than $75,000, with rate reductions between 0.6 percent and 1.5 percent of income, according to jct. about 44 percent of white americans earn this amount compared with 24 percent of blacks and 30 percent of hispanics, according to the center's analysis.
the minute-long ad also includes footage of undocumented immigrants detained at the border, scenes from the charlottesville rally, when a white nationalist intentionally drove into a crowd of anti-racism protesters, as well as law enforcement deploying tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators against police brutality outside the white house earlier this month.
a former educator, albergottie believes the massachusetts senator has a plan for the issues most important to her and her children, such as student loan relief and childcare. (alycia albergottie, warren's south carolina state director, is her daughter.) those are the issues that senator warren [is] talking about that are important for her, she told huffpost. and i do believe it's because she's a woman.
the 37-year-old three-term congressman will appear on national tv following trump's speech on jan. 30 to present the democratic party's response, according to the boston globe.
today, thanks to the affordable care act, which became law in 2010, my patients have protections whether they have obtained their insurance on the insurance exchange, through the government or through their employer. my patients do not have to worry about an annual cap on care, or a lifetime one either — a huge relief considering my patients have lifelong incurable diseases. my younger patients transitioning from school to the work force can get their first job without worrying about having a preexisting condition that would prevent them from securing affordable insurance. my female patients do not get charged more than my male patients just because of their sex. when i was pregnant, my maternity coverage was already covered by my insurance — i did not have to pay for additional coverage.
we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
this is why we need to keep up and intensify the pressure, and at the same time hammer home the need to protect medicaid – especially as republicans are now talking about including drastic cuts and changes to medicaid as part of their repeal of the aca.
since president barack obama signed the affordable care act in 2010, republicans have made repealing the law their mantra. they've fired up their base and put democrats on the defensive by promising that once they had power, they would repeal and replace.
they don't need all the specifics now. medicare for all isn't going to become law as long as republicans control the senate and donald trump is the president. meanwhile, the lawmakers and staff working on plans have already done more thinking than their conservative counterparts did about mythical, ultimately ill-fated obamacare replacements.
but in 2017, even after her vote for gorsuch, planned parenthood gave her an award, recognizing her for being an outspoken champion for women's health.
what are you doing to educate or re-educate yourself not to be racist, not to be so fragile, as a white person regardless of your gender or gender identity, so that you do not get bent out of shape any time a person of color says anything that challenges the very real white supremacy that permeates every corner of america, and this world? or do you actually believe, sister, brother, fellow human being, that white supremacy is only something that is owned by racist right-wingers who show up in places like berkeley, california, or charlottesville, virginia, to spread violence and fear and hate?
peck noted that hhs doesn't spend money on emails, the way it does for television or digital ads, so canceling those would seem particularly ill-advised.
the trump administration's proposed rules focus on association health plans ― ahps ― which are policies that organizations sell to small businesses or individuals. an example of an ahp would be a policy that a realtor's association sells to individual real estate agents, or one that a state business organization sells to family-owned businesses.
trump's latest effort to wipe out the affordable care act might very well fail, simply because even judges with previously expressed animus to the law may have little tolerance for such a shoddy argument.
although the candidates didn't knock one another often, a few of them addressed the broader question hanging over the primary: whether the party should put up a progressive who excites the base, or a centrist who might have a better chance of winning over trump voters.
frieden on sunday suggested that these states reopened too early.
buttigieg, who is the democratic mayor of south bend, indiana, is among the candidates wary of going that far.
but their instructions were vague, and legal experts like nicholas bagley, a university of michigan professor who co-authored a brief in the case, thinks it's likely o'connor will conclude that only small portions of the law can remain on the books.
another democratic member who also wished to remain anonymous was even blunter about the leadership: it's always nancy's way, the member said of the speaker. now she just doesn't have to deal with anyone telling her they have a better way.
what kind of america awaits millennials and their children: a society that strives to realize its best ideals, or the hobbesian homeland of trump and a terminally debased political party which, to preserve itself and its patrons, erodes democracy and metastasizes primordial bigotry?
there was a brief pause for the committee to discuss the appropriateness of the question before harris was allowed to continue her line of questioning.
we still have thousands of people in the state of washington who still do not have that comfort, who still live under the anxiety of a potential loss of coverage, who still are dealing not only with the problem of a disease but the problem of anxiety over their economic circumstances, inslee said.
congressman mike coffman, a republican who represents the swing district there, planned a small event at a library to meet with constituents. he expected just a handful of people, but 150 individuals showed up. most of them, according to local media reports, were present to plead with him not to go forward with an obamacare repeal without a suitable replacement in place.
he said he has, quote, very good information that china wants biden to win because biden's soft on china or cheerleads for china. the u.s. intelligence community says china wants biden to win because it sees trump as unpredictable.
i'm not afraid to stand up to anyone who's trying to rig the system. and i'm not afraid to sit down with anyone who can help come up with solutions, baldwin said.
even if you are fortunate enough to have employer-provided health care insurance or the means to purchase coverage, the promise of a return to free market flexibility should arouse dread. after all, the beneficiary of the flexibility will be the insurance company, whose rewards will come at the expense of you the patient.
mcconnell has taken the same federal-funds-for-me-but-not-for-thee approach to scientific and medical research, flooding the public university of louisville with research dollars even as he backs nationwide budget deals slashing government investment in medicine.
tom williams via getty images president donald trump tweeted on friday that he will nominate stephen moore to serve on the federal reserve's board of governors.
democratic leaders in congress have few tools available to prevent the gop from passing legislation dismantling the affordable care act in the coming weeks. they can try to slow down the senate debate long enough to make their case to the american people, again, that the upsides of obamacare outweigh the downsides, that the millions who've been helped by the law shouldn't see their benefits stripped away, and that the republican plan to repeal the law now but not enact a new set of reforms for up to four years is dangerous.
by the time obama made that visit in 2010, the house and senate had already passed their versions of health care reform. the senate did so with a 60-vote supermajority, in order to overcome a republican filibuster. nancy pelosi, the california democrat who was speaker of the house at the time, hadn't quite sold her caucus on voting for the senate's less generous, less progressive version. but she was close.
a key variable in all of this is the states, which have authority to regulate such plans on their own. several already have strong rules on the book, as a recent survey of state policies from the commonwealth fund noted. more states could take similar action.
trump, meanwhile, has been clearer on his political calculations than he is on his policy wish list. the way he describes it, he and the gop are generously offering to relieve democrats of the problems the affordable care act created or failed to solve. in his stated view, the best political course for republicans would be to do nothing and allow obamacare's shortcomings to mount so they can blame democrats for enacting it in the first place.
after chaffetz was such an aggressive watchdog of obama, and after he looked poised to attack clinton at every turn, chaffetz's hands-off approach to trump is smelling like hypocrisy. but that's not how chaffetz sees it.
rt if you agree: we need to stop #obamacare in kentucky! — matt bevin (@mattbevin) may 16, 2014
some california democrats wanted to go farther and open up medi-cal to undocumented residents of all ages. they cited, among other things, evidence that undocumented workers, who make up about 10 percent of the workforce, were less likely to get regular care ― and that, especially in the case of families, the inability of parents to get insurance meant that kids were going without coverage as well.
participation in sharing plans has increased from less than 200,000 a decade ago to more than 1 million today, according to the trade association that represents them. it is almost certainly financial appeal, rather than spiritual, that is driving this sudden growth. joining a ministry can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month less than enrolling in a traditional health insurance plan, especially in areas where premiums under the affordable care act have become most expensive.
house gop leadership has adopted a similar take-it-or-leave it approach to repealing obamacare. and because their baseline has been the removal of the prior president's signature domestic achievement, they've spent their energy exclusively on shoring up the vote in their own party.
there's so much stuff that you learn, and i get so upset now, pfeifer said. this is stuff that's right up front — they should just get it done.
and thousands of others. the bigotry was garden-variety islamophobia: memes about sharia executions and child rape, genital mutilation and muslims torturing and butchering various life forms while dusky columns of saracens, every one of them a potential jihadist, march into western lands bent on pillage. what made @amymek special was her industriousness. she never took a break.
i actually spend little time on twitter, replied hannity, who has penned nearly 32,000 tweets over seven years. but i have fun mixing it up.
meyers said that the conversation about religion and reproductive health has been dominated by the religious right ― despite the fact that clergy played a role in the abortion rights movement.
the agreement still needs approval from the full legislature and a signature from newsom. but despite a few pending issues in non-health parts of the budget, enactment appears to be all but certain, according to advocates and analysts who have followed the debate closely.
representative nick zerwas from elk river is the chief author of the ma bill hf225, attempting to raise the spend-down to $990 per month (the poverty level) and the asset limit to $10,000.
obamacare is a disaster that has hurt the middle class, the aide said, and we call on all democrats to put the american people first.
ryan has cited ayn rand, the libertarian philosopher, as a major influence. at a 2005 conference, audio of which the atlantic eventually obtained, he said, it is the morality of what is occurring right now, and how it offends the morality of individuals working toward their own free will to produce, to achieve, to succeed, that is under attack, and it is that what i think ayn rand would be commenting on.
the american medical association has also endorsed paid sick leave, arguing that by giving individuals time off to care for themselves or their children, they are reducing the risk of transmitting diseases or viruses to others or prolonging illness.
despite the claimed progress that has occurred under the aca, the president would like to see policy makers (congress?) take steps to improve the health insurance marketplace, increase financial assistance for marketplace enrollees, reduce prescription drug costs, and institute a public plan option for areas devoid of individual market competition for health insurance plans.
simply enacting such a program would be daunting, especially if the senate does not modify or abolish the filibuster, which effectively requires a vote of 60 members to pass most legislation. in an interview with huffpost on saturday, sanders indicated that he was wary of abolishing the filibuster.
and if the new health care legislation ends up looking like the american health care act, the republican bill that the house of representatives passed in early may, it could easily affect health insurance arrangements for the majority of americans ― most obviously, by depriving 23 million people of coverage altogether, according to projections by the congressional budget office.
more importantly, mr. trump controls the news cycle, so he appears to be a leader. besides scalia, the week's headline should be: george w. bush campaigns in south carolina for jeb. instead, trump effectively book-ends ws visit, pre-empting the former president's emergence from hibernation, putting the brothers on defense. w gave a bill clinton-like funny, upbeat and persuasive speech, but it won't give jeb the win he needs. jeb gave a nice forceful talk, but his candidacy remains a non-sequitur, and trump got that long ago.
i didn't choose to be diabetic, gordon said. why should i have to suffer because my body is fighting me? it's so disheartening that there are humans out there who don't understand and think that just because you happened to get unlucky in life, you don't deserve to live, said gordon, who is studying communications at the state university of new york at new paltz and works at a library and a planetarium.
for the first time in roughly a decade, democrats rather than republicans are the ones dreaming and talking about passing major new health care legislation. that's because democrats for most of the last 10 years had their hands full trying to stop republicans from undermining or repealing the affordable care act.
most join out of principle, hopp said. it's an operation consistent with their religious values.
in addition, the insidious legacy of the tuskegee syphilis experiment continues to wreak havoc on the overall health of african americans more than 40 years after the sadistic, decades-long program was finally exposed. an inherited culture of mistrust of the medical establishment and propensity for medical conspiracy theories may leave black msm wary of hiv prevention that comes in a pill and requires routine medical care. furthermore, many african americans are raised with a strong bias against going to the doctor for anything but serious illness.
inspired by stories like alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law. this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african-american community. the first step act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. now, states across the country are following our lead. america is a nation that believes in redemption.
it's like a football team, liberal rep. ro khanna (d-calif.) said. you got to have some folks who will catch the 40-yard pass. you got to have other folks who will get you the 2-yard run, the 3-yard run. a football team won't win without all the types of players.
in a district like mine, social security and medicare and medicaid are important and no one wants to lose their health insurance, rep. anthony brindisi (d-n.y.), who won his district in 2018 despite trump winning it in 2016 by 15 points, told huffpost tuesday.
associated press former vice president joe biden has been rising n the polls in his bid to unseat president donald trump.
his sotu remarks ring hollow ― no new proposals, no call for substantial new resources, said daniel raymond, policy director at the harm reduction coalition. if trump were running a corporation to end this crisis, shareholders looking for results would be ready to oust him.
but the net effect of repeal, even with a republican alternative in place, is likely to be more exposure to medical bills ― and, as a result, worse access to medical care.
mcconnell's track record is just not that of a brilliant strategist. his reputation for genius rests instead on the ineptitude of his opponents.
another poll finding was about priorities: 51 percent of self-identified democrats think it's more important for their party to focus on improving and protecting the affordable care act, while 38 percent think it's more important to pass medicare for all.
while differences between candidates could manifest themselves in plenty of ways in office, any democratic president would have an extremely tough time actually enacting systemic changes like medicare for all. lost in all of these health care debates between presidential contenders is that the resulting health care policies would probably all look very similar, regardless of which person wins.
ap photo/susan walsh, pool supreme court nominee amy coney barrett at her confirmation hearing on tuesday. she dodged questions about how she would rule on the forthcoming supreme court case about the affordable care act.
millions more with preexisting conditions could wind up virtually uninsurable, just as they were in the days before the affordable care act. others would lose access to the law's guaranteed benefits, which include coverage for hospitalizations and prescription drugs. and those with the highest health care expenses could once again face annual or lifetime limits on their coverage that would cut them off once their costs reached a certain dollar threshold.
jeffrey young contributed to this report.
i don't think this works against it. the reality is, there's unsexy hard work that hasn't happened on the ground to get these things passed, and those are things that the people we're hoping to hire, and have hired already, understand well.
our situation today is less drastic, but not so different. there's no scenario in which 63 million trump voters will fall on their knees to beg forgiveness. why not abandon that hope and get ahead on the one thing that can be done? as all our best stories tell us, grace produces more repentance than strict justice ever has or can.
he said it was more complicated than anyone thought, stewart replied, in a dig at trump's ridiculed comments on the complexities of the health care system.
here's how mulvaneym's career average of correctly answered questions compares to the average user, broken down by category.
democrats also would eliminate the affordable care act's so-called family glitch, which has prevented otherwise eligible families from accessing subsidies if a single member of the household is offered health coverage by an employer, even if that employer doesn't cover family members.
of course it's real, replied murtaugh. instead of teasing any details, he then criticized biden's plan and the obama-era affordable care act, and said he wouldn't get ahead of the white house about any announcement.
bloomberg are attempting to bring all of this together with their acquisition of netbox blue, a company that provide social media monitoring and governance technology.
it's just one more reason the november elections are so important. if republicans don't suffer electoral consequences for their behavior, they will have no reason to change. they'll be able to keep lying about their determination to preserve access to health care, even as they get back to work on taking it away.
as we know, up to one third of all health services provided each year are either unnecessary, inappropriate, or even harmful. (4) here are some examples of why we need a much stronger approach to research on comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness of health services being provided in this country:
moore was thinking, in part, about the affordable care act's employer mandate, which requires that companies pay a fine if they don't offer coverage to workers putting in more than 30 hours a week. employers, he said, would respond by forcing workers to get under that 30-hour requirement.
donald trump disregarded warnings from his top medical and intelligence experts about this outbreak for months, while lying to the american people about the overwhelming threat we faced, said andrew bates, a spokesman for likely democratic nominee joe biden, who served as obama's vice president. this is a historic failure of leadership that every american is paying for.
but for now, at least, hospitals have shown no interest in discussing further cuts. on the contrary, they are part of an industry-wide lobbying effort to defeat any expansion of government-run health insurance, even relatively modest ones that wouldn't do much to affect their revenue. that lobbying effort includes propaganda warning of long waits and shortages because, the industry group says, lower payments would inevitably lead to rationing. in the face of such pressure, pushing for more aggressive cuts has a certain political logic, even if advocates are prepared to settle a milder version in the end.
two years into his tenure as chairman, chaffetz has proven he can work better with democrats than issa. but that is maybe the lowest standard of bipartisanship on capitol hill. and in the early stages of the trump presidency, there are hardly any signs chaffetz will work with democrats to conduct any real oversight of trump.
elections, as we all know, have consequences. the last several months have laid bare the potential consequences to latino families and communities of the choices we have before us in the presidential contest. the stakes couldn't be higher and standing on the sidelines is utterly unacceptable. we must all do our part. the agenda above is simply too important to leave in the wrong hands.

the nations of the european union are preparing to reopen to international visitors ― but u.s. travelers hoping to fly to the eu in the near future may not get the chance, as coronavirus cases in the u.s. continue to explode.
insurers could charge them higher premiums, refuse to pay bills associated with their pre-existing conditions, or simply deny them coverage outright. the available policies frequently had big gaps in benefits, like limited prescription coverage or no payment for psychiatric services, in no small part because insurers knew this was a way to avoid paying big bills.
lisa stands up for alaska, gross told huffpost in an interview. i don't get that feeling from dan sullivan at all.
democrats understood that moving forward had political peril. they had gotten a taste of electoral defeat that january, when a special election in massachusetts put the late democrat edward kennedy's old seat in the hands of a republican and set in motion the chain of events that led to that march vote on the house floor. but democrats were also leading quite a large posse, including pretty much every organization that represented either the people who provide health care (like the american medical association and the american hospital association) or the people who most frequently consume it (like aarp and the american heart association).
trump's fake interest in reforming the health care system this time followed the white house's it-would-be-shocking-if-any-other-president-else-did-it decision last week to side with a bunch of state gop officials who are trying to use the courts to kill the affordable care act because everything else they've attempted hasn't worked.
an employee at a jared vault jewelry store in oklahoma city wasn't given a private space to pump, so she often clocked out and drove home when she needed to do it. the arrangement was not only inconvenient but cost her wages. another woman who worked at a cosmetics shop in a miami mall was told to use the public restroom, where the lack of privacy and heavy foot traffic made it difficult. the aggravation of dealing with her boss and the mall's management over the issue discouraged her from breastfeeding. little by little [she] pumped less and less, until eventually she gave up, the case file states. the woman filed a complaint against the employer to avoid this from happening to anyone else in the future.
on march 13 in boise and its suburbs, volunteers met in coffee shops to check in, collect materials and share stories. aaron swisher, one of two democrats vying to challenge u.s. rep. mike simpson (r) this november, stopped by to lend support. it's swisher's first political campaign.
morrisey won the primary by just under 8,000 votes, while blankenship finished a distant third. in the general, manchin and outside democratic groups hammered morrisey's lobbying history, alleging he got rich working for the opioid industry. manchin won with just under 50% of the vote in november, beating morrisey by 3 percentage points.
some republican-appointed judges take that notion seriously, which is one reason why the case might ultimately fail ― if not in the circuit court, then at some point later on in the supreme court. but it is no sure thing, which is why the affordable care act and health insurance for tens of millions of people are suddenly in jeopardy again.
all this deception is understandable from a political standpoint. the republican position that the aca is all bad and that people with preexisting conditions should have fewer protections from insurance companies is unpopular. also, the lies work on a lot of people.
this enrollment period during the coronavirus pandemic is an early test of biden's strategy to use the affordable care act as a springboard toward health coverage for all. advancing on a parallel track, the new covid-19 relief bill from house democrats would offer a generous, though temporary, increase in subsidies for people covered by the law known as obamacare.
the trump administration merely wants the court to throw out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. this, by the way, is separate from all the other stuff trump is doing to damage the affordable care act's insurance markets.
andy slavitt, who oversaw the aca while serving in the obama administration, reacted to the initial news with a tweet that called the decision aggressive and needless sabotage of the law.
warren was also among nearly two dozen democrats who, back in january, stood alongside bernie sanders, the independent senator from vermont, when he introduced a proposal that would wipe out private insurance and create, in its place, a program like medicare that would enroll all americans.
the budget scorekeeper's assessment found the revised bill would save less money than the original but have similar poor outcomes. as with the original version, 24 million fewer people would have health insurance by 2026. premiums would also rise 10 percent to 15 percent in 2018 and 2019 ― then wind up 10 percent lower by 2026, after high prices drove older customers from the market. the new version of the bill would cut just $150 billion from the deficit over 10 years, while the original legislation would have cut $337 billion.
these are some of the many ways that we ration health care in our largely private, under-regulated for-profit health care marketplace:
hagwood said such a small bump in take-home pay for workers like her won't be much economic help for the county, where many businesses throughout martinsville, the county's biggest town, with a population 13,100, remain boarded up. high grass grows on some empty lots. for most of the 20th century, the county had thriving textile and furniture industries, but they began leaving the area in the 1990s as the work moved to lower-wage countries. although the county recently recorded its lowest unemployment rate in 18 years, at 3.8 percent, the poverty rate remains stubbornly high — 19 percent of people live below the poverty line compared with the national average of 12.7 percent. about 55 percent of hispanics and 21 percent of blacks in the county live in poverty.
i used to be a preacher. the first lesson you learn is never to make it hard for someone to take a step towards jesus. to demand immediate and total conversion is to waste your effort while doing violence to the deeper idea of slow love. political conversion is no different. we want small wins that compound. any hint of judgment or coercion undoes this. we need only explain our beliefs in the most honest, direct means possible and then embody them attractively, projecting good will as we go.
but we must start somewhere at turning things around as we face the most devastating and harrowing political reality of our lifetimes. that's only going to happen when the gop hits rock bottom as progressive momentum surges. and it's appearing that may happen this november.

instead, uva's emergency department gave him a ct scan, a bill for $6,931 and, when he didn't pay, a lawsuit. uva did give him a 30% discount based on his financial circumstances, he said — meaning the sore throat would cost about $4,800.

prior to the affordable care act, health insurance companies could turn away people with pre-existing medical conditions, offer them coverage that cost much more than for healthier people, or sell them a policy that expressly didn't cover health problems with which they'd been diagnosed.
the story has been updated with the cbo's announcement that it will soon release new estimates for the american health care act.
the timing of threatening to repeal the bill — which would leave 23 million people without health insurance — couldn't be worse. the u.s. on saturday set a record for the number of new coronavirus cases recorded in a single day, reaching more than 42,000 saturday. the american death toll from the disease has hit 126,000.

even with my doubts i too, like many, hosted an election night watch party—tuesday, nov. 4, 2008—at a nightclub in new york city's greenwich village called element. those who were complete strangers reached across race, gender, sexual orientation, class, religion, no religion, ability and disability to hug each other as it was announced that obama had won! people openly wept, some convulsed in total shock and had to sit down, on a chair, on the dance floor, particularly when now president-elect obama came out on the stage in that frosty chicago air and declared, change has come to america. . . .
california, new york and washington are among the states that embraced the affordable care act by immediately adopting its medicaid expansion for low-income adults and by creating state-run health insurance exchanges.
unlike gross, sullivan has taken a neutral approach, citing the need to respect the federal government's approval process.
throughout those nine years and the preceding year and a half of legislative activity around the aca, the gop has promised over and over and over again that it would have a great plan that reduced health care costs and made sure people had access to affordable health insurance.
it was after roe that the current ideological rift began.
courtesy of us park service the number of americans projected to lose their health insurance between 2017-2018 will be about 14 times this crowd size. photo shows march for women's lives, feb 10, 2015, estimated between 800,000 and 1 million in attendance.
for anyone watching day two of the convention, it may have felt disjointed at times. the program jumped from regular people sharing stories about health care struggles, to former republican secretary of state colin powell praising biden as the right person to keep the nation safe, to an emotional message from jill biden about grief and resilience. there may not have been a clear flow, but the snippets were designed to appeal to each of biden's constituencies.
vulnerable republicans do seem to sense how damaging trump's budget could be for their party. rep. brian fitzpatrick (r-pa.), who represents a new district that is about evenly split between democrats and republicans, had no problem criticizing the trump budget. i'm opposed to it. completely opposed to it, he said.
we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ice special agent elvin hernandez. when elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic. at the age of eight, elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. elvin says: if i can make sure these young girls get their justice, i've done my job. thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.
trump's attempt to capitalize on hunter biden's baggage backfired
reaching out to predecessors had been a common practice among modern presidents, but not for trump, who frequently claims that he is smarter than those who came before him.
in the current political context, trump backing a lawsuit to shatter the affordable care act and making transparently meaningless promises about health care reform is even more ridiculous because democrats control the house. among democrats, the only question about health policy is whether to shore up obamacare or to commit to a fully government-financed health care system. if trump were to come out in favor of those things, it would be truly stunning.
obamacare's new rules have proved wildly popular, and today republicans fall all over themselves to express their support for them, even as they simultaneously try to undermine them. but those rules also forced insurers to upgrade their existing policies in order to meet the new standards. many just canceled the old policies instead, to the dismay of people who had enrolled in them and had taken obama's promise literally.
in 2010, the pew research center asked respondents if they would favor or oppose allowing an american state to secede and become independent from the country if a majority of the people from that state wanted to do this? one in four americans (25 percent) favored allowing a state to secede while 67 percent were opposed.
as a point of fact, the medicare program envisioned under medicare for all is not the program as it exists today. unlike what biden insinuated, however, it would have more generous benefits and little to no out-of-pocket spending. senior citizens, like everyone else, would be enrolled in a single-payer, national health care program.

josephson said she feels good about their insurance even though the family had to pay out of pocket for two years for wesley's daily vision therapy sessions, which their policy didn't cover. that service cost her $6,000 over those two years, but it was worth the cost, she said, because wesley showed positive results. his eyes still don't coordinate, but he has improved enough so that reading is much easier than it used to be, she said.
even as republicans in the senate judiciary committee were ramming through brett kavanaugh's nomination to the supreme court (a fifth republican justice, who just happens to believe the president is immune to subpoenas or even investigation), those same senators were plotting with trump on another attack on the rule of law.
a beshear victory on tuesday, mcgarvey said, would show that in kentucky, given the choice between a really unpopular republican and a democrat who mostly talks about economic issues, public education and health care, we can win. another loss, though, would prove equally devastating, because if democrats can't win now ― against the least popular republican governor in america, who struggled to win support from his own party in may's primary and has antagonized and enraged seemingly everyone in this state at some point over the last four years ― it's hard to imagine they have much of a near-term future here at all.
states end up in this defensive crouch, keith humphreys, a stanford professor and expert on substance abuse programs, told huffpost. they think, wait a minute, if we build a building, buildings need maintenance, light, heat ― where's the money going to come from when the grant ends?
here are nine ways republicans in washington and across the country are working together to make health insurance even worse.
trump fared far better in his final appearance with biden than in the two candidates' first debate, which was a disaster marked by trump's constant interruptions.
in these respects, cap's proposal bears more than a small resemblance to some other plans in circulation ― including one that yale political scientist jacob hacker and the economic policy institute first sketched out in 2007, as well as a scheme that writer jon walker put forward in the pages of shadowproof just a year ago.
alice trexler, a veteran member of the arlington town democratic committee, witnessed the same bursting attendance at the convention meeting, but did so with the perspective of somebody who's been to many of them.
the lower courts' actions have created uncertainty about the future of the entire affordable care act, and that uncertainty threatens adverse consequences for our nation's healthcare system, including for patients, doctors, insurers, and state and local governments, the brief says.
twila brase, the president of the citizens' council for health freedom, told healthline the ministry health sharing programs also give members freedom of choice.
obama administration officials and a handful of allies in congress tried to protect ipab but eventually relented in the face of pressure, in some cases from democrats as well as republicans in congress.
short-term plans, unlike affordable care act plans and employer plans, can reject consumers because of pre-existing conditions. they can also refuse to pay claims if they determine that a policyholder received treatment for something the insurer later determines was pre-existing. these policies also frequently have poor coverage for essential needs like hospitalizations and can cap benefits at a specific dollar amount and refuse to cover anything beyond that.
the democratic primary is two things. one, an authenticity contest, in which clinton and sanders try to show die-hard democrats that they are really, really like them -- even though both are career politicians. two, a statement of the party's purpose. here is the dream, even if it can't be enacted anytime soon.
what also came out of this debate is proof that neither ted cruz nor bernie sanders are familiar with the laws they have already passed. a woman asked what would happen to pregnancy and newborn coverage if obamacare were repealed? sanders said she would be uncovered if obamacare was repealed. cruz was simply silent. neither noted that we already have legislation on the books that protects pregnant women and children. in 1997, edward kennedy and orin hatch, the odd couple of health care, worked together to pass the children's health insurance program, administered by the united states department of health and human services. for families with incomes that are modest but too high to qualify for medicaid, the chip program provides coverage for pregnant women who do not already have pregnancy coverage, as well as coverage for all uninsured children. for those whose qualify for medicaid, pregnancy is covered automatically, as is coverage for any children born of medicaid recipients.
perhaps the most astounding mistake clinton has made, in recent days, is the way she's gone about competing with sanders on the issue of health care. sanders favors a single-payer, medicare-for-all system. clinton would prefer to make incremental expansions to obamacare.
a few people, including senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) took it upon themselves to make some edits to the tweet.
health cost sharing groups have been around for more than 20 years.
despite a large division in the democratic party over the best health care solution ― single-payer or a continuation and possible expansion of something like obamacare ― progressives in congress appear to be in lockstep with house speaker nancy pelosi's priority of shoring up the aca before tackling anything like medicare for all.
short-term plans, unlike affordable care act plans and employer plans, can reject consumers because of pre-existing conditions. they can also refuse to pay claims if they determine that a policyholder received treatment for something the insurer later determines was pre-existing. these policies also frequently have poor coverage for essential needs like hospitalizations and can cap benefits at a specific dollar amount and refuse to cover anything beyond that.
to be very clear, our aim is to get every american health care coverage. and you can say that, but people will parse everything you say to say, well, that's coverage, that's not care, or you can say, it should be affordable, or you say the word access, and everybody reads into all these words.
that the law needs fixing is not in dispute. why it needs fixing is most vividly illuminated by contrasting it with another massive piece of tax legislation, the reagan-era tax reform act of 1986.
it's easy to see why these strategies would not sit well with conservatives. but republicans don't really have alternatives.
anyone with minor children living at home should check first to see if their kids qualify for medicaid or chip, as the children's health insurance program is known. (many states adopted different names for these programs. medicaid is called tenncare in tennessee, for example, and vermont's chip is called dr. dynasaur.)
you know, i'm a doctor, and i know that might be med school. so, do you want a coverage that doesn't include maternity that obviously would be principally appealing to young men, when it doesn't include maternity?
but democrats weren't giving in. in a last-ditch effort tuesday, senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) reached out to mcconnell, asking him to separate the zika funding from the military appropriations bill. democrats also want to strike provisions that take some money from obamacare to pay for zika costs and others that target planned parenthood.
andy slavitt: i would actually agree with that characterization. i'm no fan of bipartisanship for bipartisanship's sake.
trump seems more focused on juicing tv ratings with a big show at this week's gop convention than he does on the public health crisis. the president will reportedly make an appearance every night in an effort to upstage last week's mostly virtual democratic national convention, and his family members will play big roles during the event.
it's so scammy, he said. i felt abandoned by my insurance company.
we can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
the president's made abundantly clear that his plan all along has been to destroy the affordable care act, said jesse ferguson, a democratic consultant who works with health care groups. first was by repeal, then it was going to be by lawsuit, and now he's going to try to pick the judge to rule on the lawsuit.
for years, the economic commentariat has enjoyed a running joke: stephen moore.
that doesn't mean the same thing would happen with medicare for all. one reason the affordable care act's rate shock led to so much anger is that the new obamacare plans came with high deductibles. lots of people felt like they were paying more but not getting great insurance in return. the whole point of medicare for all, like the nyha, is to give everybody better insurance than they have today.
sen. bill nelson (d-fla.), one of several senators who attended a meeting at the white house on thursday, said he was for all of the above. but he warned that public-private partnerships alone will not solve the problem of the infrastructure debilitation that we have in the country.
putnam has said he supports trump's policies, but could continue to struggle. trump is scheduled to appear at a rally for desantis on july 31.
franch said that in her nine years there, she's never seen this sort of engagement. they had a gathering at furman university after the women's march to build upon the momentum and figure out next steps. even though the meeting took place on super bowl sunday, there were about 1,000 people in the audience.
if successful, such efforts would have a devastating effect on the fight against the opioid epidemic.
congressional republicans could have fixed this issue simply by repealing the language in the aca about the mandate, which is toothless without fines now. they haven't. moreover, nearly every republican senator voted to sustain the trump administration's support for the lawsuit seeking to strike down obamacare in its entirety earlier this month.
harris has said that carper is beholden to corporate interests. the senator's vote to confirm trump supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh as a d.c. circuit court judge in 2006 could hurt his re-election chances, but he said he will not confirm kavanaugh to the supreme court.
among the gop members targeted by the tour is rep. martha mcsally, who is likely to be the republican nominee in arizona's hotly-contested senate race; california rep. mimi walters, who is facing a challenge from law professor katie porter, a protege of massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren; colorado rep. mike coffman; florida rep. carlos curbelo; iowa rep. rod blum; illinois reps. peter roskam and mike bost; michigan rep. david trott; nebraska rep. don bacon; virginia rep. barbara comstock and new york rep. claudia tenney, a top trump ally.
harris says a more dramatic change makes sense because a government program like medicare is the surest, most efficient way to make sure everybody has comprehensive coverage. we have a medicare system that's already working, harris wrote in her post. now, let's expand it to all americans and give everyone access to comprehensive health care.
even the white house appeared reticent about embracing the new plan.
the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day! oh, wow! he joked. let's celebrate! hey!
2. mitch mcconnell, senate majority leader (last week's ranking: 2), paul ryan, speaker of the house, and all other republicans in congress.
all of this is taking place against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in which the top democratic candidates support more ambitious schemes, including medicare for all, that would get the u.s. to universal coverage or at least awfully close while addressing other problems, like the difficulty of dealing with private insurers, that narrower reforms cannot.
his history on lgbtq issues has become liberal enough that the human rights campaign endorsed lynch over goldstein, who is openly gay and runs massachusetts general hospital's transgender health program.
there's so much to say about the republican memo criticizing the fbi and justice department's investigation of a member of donald trump's presidential campaign. and what better way to say it than in the trending hashtag #yomemo?
many people do not understand that there are many kinds of christians. conservative christians dominate the television and radio media and influence people to think that this brand of christianity 'is' christianity. although they have great influence, this stance is far from representing the true tenets of the person of jesus christ, wiley said. as a progressive womanist christian who is concerned about wholeness in the community, especially for those who are marginalized and disenfranchised, my task is to do what jesus did, to meet people where they are with love and understanding, and bring healing and freedom to them.
it's not true at all, hicks said. it's just a cruel policy. the whole bill is cruel. there's no compassion in it. he's such a hypocrite. he's going to uninsure 24 million people.
congress could fund the treatment and testing for the uninsured in an emergency spending bill that is expected to pass the house and senate this week. and if such a provision made it into the bill, republicans and democrats would almost certainly vote for the idea overwhelmingly.
mike blake / reuters sharing the presidential debate stage for the first time, former vice president joe biden and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) largely avoided a long-awaited showdown.
ok, i'll bite. what is the far better and much less expensive alternative? i'll wait...🙄 — david gorski, md, phd (@gorskon) june 27, 2020
what we're doing is we're going to be doing a health care plan — preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions ― as an example, yourself, it sounds like that's exactly perfect, trump said at the time. that's exactly what we're talking about. we're going to be doing a health care plan very strongly and protect people with preexisting conditions.
santoro, 28 years old when she died, was separated from her husband of 10 years, whom she accused of abusing her. she had begun seeing a married man, became pregnant, and feared for her life when she learned her estranged husband was coming back to town. she and her boyfriend, using a borrowed textbook and surgical instruments, attempted to perform an abortion, but something went fatally wrong. he fled; her body was found by a maid the next morning. her daughters were told she had died in a car accident and did not learn the truth until the controversial photo was published and she was recognized by her sister.
a ruling in favor of the state officials or the trump administration would herald the return of the days when people with any black marks on their medical histories could find themselves uninsurable.
greg gianforte, the republican candidate for montana's open house seat, stands to get tax cuts worth nearly $800,000 a year if the house health care bill becomes law, according to a new analysis.
everything is up in the air. we don't know what's going to happen, she said.
the primary victory gives mcgrath a second chance to win a seat in congress after she narrowly lost the race for a central kentucky house seat to gop rep. andy barr in 2018.
it means building a permanent campaign infrastructure that sits here year in and year out, self said. that means fundraising all the time. that means communications all the time. that means a digital program that runs all the time. … because we haven't had to organize for 20, 30 years, there isn't that network of professional campaign staff that you see in other states. so we've got to build that.
the concept behind block grants and similar proposals for medicaid is simple: instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. and that amount is less than states get now.
donnelly's campaign has repeatedly pointed out that as a state representative in 2016, braun voted against a measure that would retract tax breaks given to businesses that move their operations out of state.
one veteran asked ernst about whether she would do more to investigate russia meddling in our elections and meddling with our democracy. when ernst noted that last week, she called on president donald trump to stand up against vladimir putin, constituents shouted: investigate trump!
the mayo clinic, charities and fundraisers helped enough that rice and crawford could pay down most of her roughly $1 million in medical bills, but the cancer still cost the couple $25,000 out of pocket. rice still needs ongoing care and supplies that cost about $5,000 a year, and crawford, 48, requires medication to treat their bipolar disorder.
reforming obamacare, in michigan and beyond
but if the ahca fight proved anything among house republicans, it's that the only bill that can pass with votes in just their conference is one that undermines protections for the sick in exchange for lower premiums for everybody else.
a closer look at trump's list of claimed historic accomplishments, though, shows that virtually all of the major ones are generic republican party objectives that any gop president would have approved. what's more, they were almost entirely the work of a republican congress led by house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), and which had been waiting years for a republican president to come along.
whichever approach to health care reform ― and whichever candidate ― ultimately prevails, one thing is clear: democratic candidates and voters alike agree the american health care system is flawed, and the government should play a big role in fixing it.
the regulation isn't final yet ― and states will have their say
if you leave any loopholes open, insurers will take full advantage, and people with health needs will quickly find the coverage they need to be inaccessible, unaffordable or both, said sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown's center for health insurance reform.
washington ― when rep. jason chaffetz, the republican chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee, thought hillary clinton was going to be president, he could barely wait to start investigating.
kavanaugh similarly declined to weigh in on trump's controversial comments last year in which he said both sides were to blame for violence at the charlottesville, virginia, white supremacist rally. i stay out of commenting on current events, the judge explained.
otter issued an executive order inviting insurance companies to design health plans that, among other things, could charge people different rates based on their medical histories. this was so obviously a violation of the affordable care act that even the trump administration had to tell idaho they couldn't do it. but in its rejection, the administration reminded state officials that its own efforts to undermine obamacare made the idaho plan redundant.
there is more at stake here than the future of the affordable care act, fox and yost write. the real issue in this case is power — and, in particular, the limits of judicial power.
iowa more democrats voted absentee than on election day.
public polling gives gross' allies reason to be upbeat. gross was tied with sullivan in a late august survey conducted by public policy polling, a democratic firm that sometimes overstates the chances of its party's candidates.
her group counts arrests and forced interventions on pregnant women in the united states and tallied 413 cases between 1973 and 2005 and a jump to 800 between 2006 and 2018. most are for drinking or drug use during pregnancy, but others include refusing a c-section, refusing bedrest, refusing a doctor's recommendation for additional diabetes testing, and a failed attempt at suicide, the last of which resulted in a murder charge.
there's a risk in voting against these bills. most members actually want to provide relief to workers struggling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus, and voting no during a time of distinct challenge for people just because you want a better bill can be politically perilous.
it's pretty shocking when you think about all the grudges trump has held, refusing to hire people who spoke out against him during the campaign (and thwarting those who slipped in from getting better jobs in the administration) while venting against gop senators like arizona's jeff flake for criticizing him and john mccain for voting against obamacare repeal.
it's not just that republicans are less interested in talking about the issue ― it's also that democrats are finally feeling emboldened.
amy zellmer is an award-winning author, speaker, and advocate of traumatic brain injury (tbi). she is a frequent contributor to the huffington post, and has created a private facebook group for survivors and also produces a podcast series. she sits on the brain injury advisory council (biac) through the brain injury association of america's and is involved with the minnesota brain injury alliance. she travels the country with her yorkie, pixxie, to help raise awareness about this silent and invisible injury that affects over 2.5 million americans each year.
there are about 1 million nonwhite registered voters in south carolina. the problem for democrats is that only about half of them vote regularly. if harrison can drive historic turnout among the black community, that would bolster his chances of winning greatly.
sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) appeared to give kavanaugh a chance to respond to critics who say he snubbed fred guttenberg, the father of a parkland shooting victim, on tuesday. kavanaugh instead spent several minutes on his charitable habits, including his experience helping the homeless through catholic organizations.
marshall will fill the seat sen. pat roberts (r) held for more than two decades. roberts' decision to retire at the end of this term set off a heated gop primary race to replace him, especially after secretary of state mike pompeo decided against a run. marshall defeated former kansas secretary of state kris kobach, an anti-immigration hard-liner whose campaign democrats tried to boost in hopes it would help them turn the seat blue.
the president was seeking momentum on the campaign trail a day after he and biden squared off in dueling televised town halls that showcased striking differences in temperament, views on racial justice and approaches to the pandemic.
making a few simple points about household budgeting, porter demonstrated how the bank's $16.50 minimum wage is not keeping pace with basic living expenses in california ― which puts bank employees hundreds of dollars in the red every month, while the bank's shareholders enjoy over $1 billion a month in pure profit.
during the transition, [biden] pushed as hard as anyone for the administration's proposal to achieve universal coverage, said mark gitenstein, who was co-chair of biden's transition team and said he was in every health care meeting that biden attended during that period. we had a number of conversations about timing and how best to achieve our goal, but the vice president never wavered in his belief that everyone in this country deserves quality, affordable health care.
the suburban philadelphia congressman denied sexually harassing the woman, and blamed the stress of the gop's failed obamacare repeal for some of the behavior she perceived as hostile. he used taxpayer dollars to settle her complaint.
the move made sense — trump remains popular in the state, and polling showed more than 60% of kentucky voters oppose impeaching the president. but democrats suggested trump's campaign rally may have backfired in cities like louisville and lexington, where voters detest the president and huge margins voting for beshear helped doom bevin.
but legal analysts from across the political spectrum thought the statements were hints at how roberts and kavanaugh would likely vote. and that could save the remainder of the affordable care act, given that the three democratic appointees on the bench are also expected to vote to uphold the rest of the law, even if the mandate itself comes off the books.
republicans are already anticipating some losses in next week's elections, but there's a lingering nightmare scenario they also have to brace for: what happens if democrats win big — like, really big?
to the extent experts have tried to perform similar analyses on the sanders proposal, the verdict has been mixed, depending in part on assumptions they made about missing details in the bill.
here's a summary from huffpost a few months ago detailing the deliberation involved in creating obamacare:
but trump, who is down in the polls with less than two weeks until election day, needed a home run ― and he didn't get it. biden held his own. and trump still lacks answers about his administration's handling of the coronavirus, how he would achieve universal coverage in the absence of the affordable care act and how he could ensure that gains in the stock market benefit ordinary people.
why the gop lawsuit is so weak ― and so dangerous
ernst, an anti-abortion senator who is seeking her second term this year, joined 38 of her republican senate colleagues in january in asking the supreme court to revisit and potentially overturn roe, which protects the right to abortion. the friend of the court brief was also signed by 168 house members.
but while the case seems unlikely to prevail, defenders of the law and advocates for the people who depend on it aren't ready to dismiss the threat out of hand. and it's easy to see why, given not just the stakes but also the circumstances of wednesday's hearing.
it's hard to see how any of this would prevent anyone dying in the street.
government health care programs with multiple private insurers, including medicare advantage, almost always have risk adjustment schemes. when they work properly, the insurers with the healthy customers basically send money over to the ones with the sicker customers.
yes, the candidate was still the boss of his campaign.
two years ago, trump halted payments to insurers that cover the poorest policyholders, making the process of buying coverage more confusing and causing insurers to increase premiums (although, for convoluted reasons, some subsidized policyholders wound up with cheaper coverage anyway). the same year, trump slashed the budget for public outreach about the insurance sign-up period and enrollment counselors.
there's appetite on both sides of the aisle to think about ways to improve conditions for working moms at this point in history, sherwin said. there could be real momentum around strengthening this.
under the 2010 affordable care act, former democratic president barack obama's signature domestic policy achievement commonly known as obamacare, 31 states expanded medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, adding millions of people to the rolls.
with the dissolution of the individual mandate, these changes have potential to shake up the markets for people buying coverage on their own.
the race will test alaska's independent streak.
nobody today is telling us what they're going to replace it with, he said. i don't think anybody knows, to be honest with you.
it would put [states] in a horrendous position if they have a significant outbreak, holahan said. it would either be bad for them fiscally if they decide to serve everybody or it would be bad for people if they decide that they couldn't because they agreed to this capped amount of federal money.
the idea is also popular, according to the new kaiser poll. fifty-six percent of americans strongly favor or somewhat favor the idea, compared with 42 percent who somewhat oppose or strongly oppose.
the killing of george floyd in may, and the subsequent protests around police violence and structural racism, have essentially left the party with no choice but to embrace the black lives matter movement, even if neither harris nor biden explicitly said the phrase black lives matter. (hillary clinton, however, did.)
americans who lost jobs and job-based health benefits from a company with at least 20 employees can opt to remain in their current health insurance, typically for 18 months but sometimes longer. cobra ― named after the law that created it, the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 ― gives former employees that right.

a rattled collins has resorted to calling this bribery in an exclusive statement to right-wing website newsmax, which tells us exactly which audience she's attempting to shore up and gain sympathy from.
but giving those institutions extra money, like easing up on payment reductions, has implications for the budget math of health reform, because it could increase the price of health care ― and thus the price of a new national health system.
if moderates got serious about opposing a bill touching the medicaid program, and if conservatives were truly serious about opposing a bill that doesn't touch it, an obamacare repeal might be impossible.
this says something important about the debate over health care, which has taken on a more prominent role as the presidential campaign nears its end. we tend to talk about obamacare like it's one program, but it's really more like 51 different programs ― one for each state, plus one for the district of columbia. in some states, like arizona, the insurance marketplaces for individual consumers look like actuarial train wrecks, and some residents are going to struggle as a result. in other states, like california, the marketplaces are functioning more or less as intended ― and the law is achieving most of its primary goals.
the most profound effect on coverage would be on medicaid, the government-run health program for the poor. thirty-six states plus the district of columbia have expanded the program to cover residents with income below or just above the poverty line. for millions of people, it has meant less financial hardship, better access to care and improved health, research has shown.

mekelburg had also been trying to make inroads into what ibrahim hooper calls the cottage-industry of islam haters, which is run by bigots such as pamela geller, robert spencer, david horowitz, brigitte gabriel and frank gaffney — several of whom have close ties to the republican establishment and the trump administration. their efforts can be remunerative, thanks to generous funding from conservative and libertarian foundations such as the donors capital fund.
washington – at least from a ratings standpoint, america's 45th presidency without a doubt has had a successful first season, tremendous even.
but premiums would be falling because insurance would be covering less, so that medical care was becoming cheaper on the front end (when people paid premiums), but more expensive on the back end (when they actually used medical services).
cigna intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options in accordance with the merger agreement, it said in a statement.
officials at the new york state office of mental health, which oversees all mental health treatment in the prison system, and the new york state department of corrections and community supervision told huffpost that mekelburg has never worked for them. she isn't licensed as a psychotherapist or a social worker ― although she tricked galasso and her then-boyfriend into doing counseling sessions with her, according to galasso. huffpost could find no evidence of mekelburg ever holding a full-time job anywhere.
the labor department records make clear that many companies still break a law meant to protect a mother's right to pump at work, including companies that tout themselves as mother-friendly. employers broke the law in 255 of the cases huffpost obtained, or 68%. in slightly more than half the cases, employers violated the requirement that they provide adequate space for pumping. in roughly a third, they violated the requirement that they provide sufficient break time. in nearly one out of every five cases, employers ran afoul of both provisions. a complaint from a worker prompted the vast majority of the investigations.
this invocation of original intent is important, legal experts said tuesday, because it typically appeals only to right-wing judges, and the 5th circuit, based in new orleans, happens to have quite a few of those. eleven of its 16 active judges were appointed by republican presidents, and that includes five appointed just in the last few years by trump.
iowa's gop leaders could have tried some version of that. they also could have launched, finally, a serious outreach effort to boost enrollment.
how swiftly and ruthlessly would trump's version of the saturday night massacre unfold? if republicans keep control of both chambers of congress, where oversight has consistently been more like a cover-up, count on trump and his new, pliable attorney general to waste no time in trying to shut it down. any other investigations of trump's sprawling corruption will likely meet the same fate.
trump has already corrupted the democratic sensibility of republican base voters. polling shows that many republicans don't care that trump is a congenital liar; more republicans than not believe trump should have the power to shut down news outlets. most remarkably, 40 percent of republicans are willing to accept russian interference in our elections if it helps their party win.
biden's plan would allow these under-insured or uninsured workers to go into the health coverage exchanges and take advantage of the newly enhanced subsidies there by enrolling in one of the private insurance options, whether it's a local blue cross plan or something from a big company like aetna. they could also choose to enroll in the new public option that biden has promised to create.
there is no love lost between waters and wall street, and she's pushed back against republican attacks on freshmen democrats in the past. in march, when mchenry and his colleague rep. alex mooney (r-w.va.) were taking veiled shots at rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), waters made no apologies about shutting them down.
here's what the gop has in mind: weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. skimpier benefits that leave out coverage for important medical needs. less protection from financial harm due to illness. and a number of actions designed to make the affordable care act's exchanges less stable for the millions of americans who use them.
bill baer, who was head of the justice department's antitrust division when it decided to sue to block both the insurance deals but has since left the agency, also hailed the decision. together with the decision on aetna and humana, this preserves five large national providers of critically important health insurance products, he said.
congress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions. ... it repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place, five legal scholars, two of whom had led previous legal challenges to the affordable care act, wrote in an official brief when the case first went before a u.s. district judge in texas.
correction: a previous version of this story indicated john mccain had been released from the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota, instead of in phoenix.
the case is separate from a challenge to the health care law that the court has agreed to hear in its term that begins in october.
republicans are outraged ― outraged! ― that anyone would believe they don't support protecting people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination. they feel so strongly about this that they are doing absolutely nothing about it.
when reed said this could be fixed simply by growing the economy, the crowd booed loudly again.
little happened on thursday night to directly and immediately threaten the polling lead of the top three presidential candidates ― former vice president joe biden, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) ― and, beyond their now-standard opening 30-minute exchange on health care and medicare for all and a brief scuffle on biden's vote for the iraq war, they avoided directly criticizing each other.
note that even as obama highlighted progress on gender equity, he also reminded us that progress is not perfection, and called for continued efforts to achieve full equality. there's one other thing the president did not mention, but which is of crucial importance in understanding the achievements of his administration in terms of progressive economics. the federal tax code has become significantly more progressive than it was eight years ago, and is overall more progressive than it has been since before reagan's presidency, with the top 1% paying their highest effective tax rates since 1979.
teixeira also suggested that she cast doubt on buttigieg's experience implementing complex policies and his credibility as a fighter for ordinary people.
cohn, however, was not worried about these changes in his fox news sunday interview.
schuelke also is new to politics. taking action lets her feel she has a say in a state where the elected leaders aren't listening, she said. we are so out of balance. if you are in the middle or you are a democrat, you have no voice, she said.
one can debate the best policies and solutions for all this -- and we should. but the gop has utterly abdicated its responsibility to participate in reasoned governance, and so given us donald trump.
previous income thresholds would remain the same, but instead of $500 per dependent like the last round, the new proposal offers $1,200 ― with the amount families are receiving capped at $6,000.
the plan endorsed by house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.), by contrast, offers less financial assistance to low-income people, likely resulting in millions of americans losing the health coverage they have today, and provides tax credits to people with higher incomes. the bill scraps key consumer protections.
america's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress, biden said. that we've found the light. and in this dark moment, i believe we are poised to make great progress again. that we can find the light once more.
yes, our economy has recovered from crisis stronger than almost any other in the world. but there are folks of all races who are still hurting -- who still can't find work that pays enough to keep the lights on, who still can't save for retirement. we've still got a big racial gap in economic opportunity. the overall unemployment rate is 5 percent, but the black unemployment rate is almost nine. we've still got an achievement gap when black boys and girls graduate high school and college at lower rates than white boys and white girls. harriet tubman may be going on the twenty, but we've still got a gender gap when a black woman working full-time still earns just 66 percent of what a white man gets paid. (applause.) we've got a justice gap when too many black boys and girls pass through a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. this is one area where things have gotten worse. when i was in college, about half a million people in america were behind bars. today, there are about 2.2 million. black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than white men.
biden has never viewed the 2020 election as a fight over policy, instead preferring to frame it as a vaguer, more grandiose fight over the soul of the nation. during the primaries, he would often apologize to audiences if he spent too much time talking about policy ― a sharp contrast to candidates like sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.).
one reason sanders' position on the filibuster matters is that medicare for all entails replacing existing insurance arrangements, public and private, with a single government program that would enroll nearly everybody and set prices throughout the health care system.
a number of progressive groups have supported collins over the years, believing that she was one of the few reasonable republicans left in the caucus who supported issues like lgbtq equality, the environment and abortion.
two house committees began moving the legislation wednesday without a cbo analysis about what it would do ― to the consternation of democrats, who failed to force the panels to delay their proceedings until they had that information.
on this unusually cold morning in columbia, a multigenerational, largely black crowd listened, restlessly at times, as the candidates tried to win them over. sanders reminded them of his stance on president donald trump's foreign policy and king's opposition to the vietnam war. steyer, standing with a group of black campaign workers, said he may not be able to feel black americans' pain but is with them in the fight for equality. gabbard evoked south carolina civil rights activist septima clark and vowed to carry the torch she did. patrick, the only black candidate in the race at that time, who has since dropped out, rattled on for a 16-minute sermon to a crowd that had mostly dispersed after the front-runners delivered their remarks.

these plans are not insurance and the law does not treat them that way. they are voluntary arrangements for people who agree to certain conditions, such as abiding by christian faith, or forswearing alcohol and smoking. they generally do not pay for services that violate religious tenets, such as abortion or maternity coverage from pregnancies out of wedlock. they also offer spiritual support, soliciting prayers for the sick from their members.
furthermore, two of the newly democrat-controlled states banned the homophobic and transphobic gay and trans panic defense, which had allowed defendants to potentially justify a violent crime as a reaction to a victim's sexuality. connecticut became the fifth state to do so, banning the defense for violence or criminal behavior, and new york, the sixth, prohibited the defense for homicides. new york also passed the gender expression non-discrimination act, which aims to combat discrimination against transgender people by establishing gender identity as a protected class in multiple contexts, including housing and employment.
they're saying, 'here's this option that's affordable and wonderful,' and not talking about how limited the plans are. jessica altman, pennsylvania insurance commissioner
as it turned out, the elements of trump's candidacy with the narrowest public appeal ― racism, mismanagement, vanity, inattention to policy detail ― came to fruition, while the heterodox policy stances and rhetoric that gave some on the populist left and right the faintest whiff of optimism fell by the wayside.
basically, a disabled minnesotan receiving ssdi (social security disability insurance) of $1000 a month would be required to pay out of their own pocket the first $208 of their monthly medical bills — leaving them with $792 to cover all of their expenses for the entire month. ssdi is something they have paid into during their working career. they were disabled through no fault of their own and they should be able to keep it to live off of — they earned it.
there are multiple black needs and if you're going to develop a strategy to appeal to people of color you have to recognize there are multiple boxes to check. bobby donaldson, a professor of african american history and the director for the center for civil rights history and research at the university of south carolina
obama and his allies sought to minimize that sort of disruption, by avoiding major changes to employer coverage, when they wrote the legislation that eventually became the affordable care act. but they also wanted to rewrite the rules for people buying private insurance on their own, because those were the policies with huge benefit gaps and the ones insurers frequently would not sell to people with preexisting conditions.
i think our kids should have a better start for their future than debt. and then most of the people who can't afford health care, he said. my heart goes out to them. that's why i'm going more for bernie and elizabeth because they are fighting for this.
about this growing inequality, there has likewise been much talk. but, again, are we hearing cries from the rich that this inequality, and the suffering and insecurity it inflicts on so many, is intolerable, unendurable, cannot be allowed to continue, must be amended? (no.)
throughout late 2017, national republicans had a deep-seated fear president donald trump would put their party's majority in the u.s. senate at risk. after the failure of the party's obamacare repeal efforts, trump was feuding with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. recently ousted white house strategist steve bannon was preparing a political insurrection, threatening to mount and fund primary challenges to every incumbent republican senator, save for ted cruz of texas.
stevenson's office is located on the campus of benedict college, and he said he is constantly making sure students are registered to vote. he graduated from south carolina state university, a historically black college in orangeburg, and learned the importance of political activism through an african politics class he took in the 1970s. he is looking forward to hearing about how the candidates plan to support historically black colleges and universities with more funding. in january, for example, biden launched an outreach program on hbcu campuses across the country to get more support from younger black voters.

without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get coverage. that will cause yet more problems for insurers, who will respond in the same way they have before: by raising rates or pulling out of markets altogether.
republicans will likely respond as they always have, making the argument sen. dean heller (r-nev.) did in a closed-door event this month. the problem, they'll say, is still with the law itself. give republicans more seats in congress, and this time, they'll actually repeal it.
one reason may be that public opinion about medicare for all reflects not just feelings about their existing insurance but also feelings about the alternative, especially in an era when faith in government remains, by historical standards, relatively low.
he's a judge who's not trying to impose any personal preferences onto his decision but take the law as written, kavanaugh said of garland.
the sums that go back and forth in the aca's risk adjustment program are substantial. in 2016, the payments were equivalent to 11 percent of all the premium dollars insurers collected when selling comprehensive policies to individuals, according to federal statistics. and that is just an overall figure, with lots of variation from carrier to carrier.

the u.s. has by far the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths; brazil has the second highest numbers, with over 1.3 million recorded infections and at least 57,00 deaths as of sunday.
critics have seen trump's response to the crisis as slow and muddled. last spring, trump created an opioid commission to study the epidemic and make recommendations. many of its proposals were aimed at organizing a public health response to those suffering from opioid addiction. trump spent most of the past year unsuccessfully pushing to repeal obamacare ― which would mean tens of thousands of addicts would have lost access to drug treatment.
indeed, not only does their already agreed-upon budget for 2019 renew the call for repealing the affordable care act, many top-tier republican candidates and the trump administration are at this very moment party to a lawsuit directly aimed at nullifying protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
hatch spokesman matt whitlock tried to put a band-aid on the senator's obamacare insults.
asked about his vote, sullivan's campaign manager matt shuckerow emphasized sullivan's work to stop parts of the law that he believes hurt the state, including the proposed tax on high-cost cadillac insurance plans that cover many union members, a medical device tax, and the individual mandate to buy health insurance. (democrats and republicans united to repeal all three provisions in a dec. 2019 spending bill.)
republicans were indeed limited in their ability to change the rest of the health care law. but that's because they didn't have the votes to do it. just months before, prior to passing the tax cut, republicans had tried desperately to pass legislation repealing the affordable care act ― and they used the same reconciliation procedures to do it. they famously came up one vote short in the senate when the late arizona republican sen. john mccain gave a dramatic thumbs down.
today's decision in texas v. azar is a win for all americans and confirms what i have said all along: that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of obamacare, is unconstitutional, president donald trump said in a statement. trump also stated that his administration will continue implementing the affordable care act while the case goes through the courts.
however, biden's opponents have crept into his lead with black voters nationally, according to a quinnipiac poll released on feb. 10, shortly after his weak performance in iowa. former new york city mayor michael bloomberg's support among black voters has skyrocketed to 22%, with biden just ahead of him at 27%. a feb. 21 nbc poll found that sanders now has similar levels of support among black voters nationally as biden does.
the industry itself doesn't make guarantees, she said.
besides, the status quo rations care too ― by making it so inaccessible for people with skimpy coverage or no insurance at all. all over the u.s., every single day, people are delaying or simply skipping procedures because they can't afford them and high hospital prices are one reason why.
but grayson has his share of accolades as well. he has been called the most effective member of the house by slate magazine. he has also written more bills and passed more amendments than any other member of the house.
sen. jeff flake (r-ariz.) asked kavanaugh whether he believes a president should be able to use his authority to pressure agencies for political purposes, citing president donald trump's suggestion that the department of justice ought to lay off prosecuting republicans ahead of the november midterm elections.
indeed, self-preservation seems to have been the sole motivation behind trump's lame insistence that he alone can fix it.
whatever he decides, the 5th circuit ruling still represents a victory for trump and his allies, who in 2017 tried and failed to pass legislation repealing president barack obama's signature domestic policy achievement.
even as as house republicans prepared to take this momentous step, there were new signs of just how difficult passing legislation would be. the house legislation calls for rolling back the affordable care act's expansion of medicaid, which the majority of states have embraced and allowed millions to get insurance.
as it just so happens, acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney is also from lancaster, south carolina, also attended georgetown and is also a proud irish-american. what's more, learned league allows members to see who players have invited to join the league, and two of the players referred by mulvaneym — weichertm and johnsonb8 — share names with mulvaney's picks for acting director of the office of personnel management in the white house office of management and budget and acting deputy director of the cfpb, respectively. we've reached out to mulvaney for confirmation on his trivia habit and will update if and when we hear back.
it'd be a lot simpler than the existing system ― no more billing hassles, no more dealing with pre-authorization from insurance companies, no more worrying about whether a doctor is in-network. the government could really limit national health spending, in the way most other countries do.
this is why, i believe, people in america rejected both the bush and clinton political dynasties in 2016. people are tired of business as usual, the same recycled political speak, the same names and faces, no matter how well-intentioned. polar opposites, yes, but sanders and trump represent truth-telling to their followers. moreover, that truth-telling has got to be rooted in what is best for all people, not just some people. that truth-telling has got to be about healing people, not hurting people. that truth-telling cannot be limited to when politicians are campaigning, nor is it just american politics that needs to be transformed.
many of those relying on straight ma through the ma expansion (like myself) are at risk of losing their benefits with the repeal of the affordable health care act (aca, obamacare). those with ma disability are at risk of losing their benefits because of block grants that the gop wants to push through.

you shouldn't have to worry about an attorney general taking away your health care, a democratic super pac ad in missouri says. an ad in north dakota features a woman with heart disease declaring to gop rep. kevin cramer: i don't know why you voted to allow insurance companies go back to denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. but i know [democratic sen. heidi heitkamp] would never do that.
democrats point out they have already sent gsa multiple letters asking for additional information about the trump hotel lease. if chaffetz were really serious about aggressive oversight and working through this issue, they charge, why did he only ask for an unredacted version of the lease and not the other information committee members sought? why aren't lawmakers holding a hearing?
in theory, these sorts of reforms should not be difficult to enact. but some of the most important ones require legislative action, and republicans in congress have refused to discuss changes short of outright repeal.
this is the biggest challenge i've faced, graham, who has held the seat since 2003, acknowledged on tuesday at a rally headlined by vice president mike pence. the appearance so late in the race by such a high-profile gop speaker ― pence's first visit to south carolina in over a year ― signaled the earth may be slowly shifting in what has long been regarded as a gop stronghold.
pence has advocated for tax cuts, obamacare repeal and less federal control over second amendment rights. the businessman called obamacare, formally known as the affordable care act, an attack on the middle class.
and yet, clinton has responded to the adversity by doing, frankly, what clintons always tend to do -- going on the attack. that's not necessarily a bad thing, as long as those attacks make sense in the context of a democratic primary. what clinton has come up with, however, is strategic madness.
to me the executives who overcharge for epi-pens and any single gop senator who mangled obamacare are made out of the same cheap swath of cheese cloth.

we're going to be listening to the governor and the kentucky general assembly, freshman rep. james comer (r-ky.) said wednesday. kentucky's uninsured rate fell by more than 12 percentage points under the affordable care act ― the largest drop of any state in the nation. the state's republican governor, matt bevin, ran as an opponent of obamacare. but after he was elected, he went back on a promise to gut the medicaid expansion.
rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), the democratic socialist who nominated sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) for the presidency, stressed the importance of strong progressive priorities. she used her short speaking time to celebrate a movement of people striving to recognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny and homophobia.

let me remind you about the trump campaign for president, in which he said he wanted to repeal the affordable care act and offer a bill which would provide health care coverage for everybody at lower cost and better quality, hoyer said at a news conference on capitol hill. as soon as he sends that bill down to the congress, i'm voting for it. but there has been no such bill coming either from the administration or from the republicans in congress.
changing positions on big gop issues
there's no denying that progressives in massachusetts are energized, angry by how the national ticket played out and eager to win races. on top of that, there's the heated markey-kennedy senate primary that's being billed as a progressive under attack.

the tax cuts and jobs act, signed by trump last december, cut the income tax rates across the board for large corporations and many small businesses and partnerships. individuals received tax preferences in the form of a temporary increase in the child tax credit and the standard deduction. they also received temporary reductions in individual income tax rates.
moore has written for the wall street journal's op-ed page and is a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation, a conservative think tank. but he has few of the credentials one might normally seek in a fed nominee, like a doctorate or relevant experience as anything other than a partisan commentator. and he has a long, long history of being extremely wrong about a lot of things, not just the economy. take, for example, climate change and health care:
no nominee to the supreme court has ever been confirmed by the senate this close to a presidential election. barrett's confirmation would give trump - who has been touting the appointment at campaign rallies to the cheers of his supporters - a major political victory eight days before the election.
one reason briefs from outside scholars and groups are important is that the trump administration's lawyers are arguing on the side of the plaintiffs. that's a highly unusual move. the justice department's lawyers customarily defend federal statutes, even ones that the current president doesn't like, except in cases where a law is clearly unconstitutional ― which isn't the case here.
we'll keep talking about health care, health care, health care, she said, while mentioning that the budget proposal is terrible for people who just want to try and improve their lives.
the justice department's legal brief also seemed to be trying to carve out some exceptions. for example, the administration said the aca's anti-fraud provisions should remain in effect.
the words sound right. but forgive the people who actually responded to the nightmare of that clear, warm september morning if they don't think the lawmakers understand, or don't believe their pronouncements. forgive them if they look askance at three men who ― just last year ― never used their power to ease the way for a new 9/11 health and compensation law, who never even signed on as sponsors of that legislation.
white manhood is mad fragile in our nation, has always been, and by and large has always been defined, at least partially, by its oppression and domination of others. racism is both the crutch and the weapon of those white men in america who are highly insecure and utterly mediocre and who fear the power and genius of the others. this is not a fairy tale. this is not a mirage. this is the autobiography of america.

recent polling suggests her rival for the democratic nomination, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), is not only ahead of clinton in new hampshire, but is neck-and-neck, perhaps even ahead, in iowa. that these early states are shaping up as competitive shouldn't be a shock to anyone. voters break late -- many aren't paying close attention until a few weeks before their state's contest.
the party of fiscal responsibility rewards demanding donors with reckless tax cuts that generate trillion-dollar annual deficits. the party that founded the environmental protection agency guts its powers and dismisses the climate change endangering our planet. the party of free trade promotes trade wars and tariffs. the party of human rights supports a president who gives succor to murderous authoritarians around the globe ― from russia to the philippines to a megalomaniac in saudi arabia who believes, by virtue of trump's indulgence, that he can butcher journalists with impunity.
taken together, these new pieces of evidence would seem like a reminder not to take every report of obamacare trouble at face value.

few republicans have released fundraising totals in recent days, even if many gop operatives believed the announcement of trump's nominee would lead to a windfall. in multiple appearances on fox news over the past week, graham openly begged the audience for donations to help counteract the mounting war chest of jamie harrison, his democratic opponent, who is outspending on television ads by large margins. help me. they're killing me, money-wise. help me, graham told sean hannity's audience on thursday night.
biden is heading into the final 75 days of the election with leads in the polls both nationally and in key swing states, in part because the race is primarily a referendum on trump's term as president. a key part of keeping the race a referendum is denying traction to trump's biggest arguments about biden, and the convention accomplished that.

why should cost be considered if a drug can significantly improve my health? the most important question you should ask is whether or not a treatment or drug actually works for your individual condition. but the cost of that treatment is also important. you may have a very high deductible to pay, and if the treatment is of questionable effectiveness, that cost factor may be very important in your decision making process. looked at more broadly, it would be irresponsible for a physician to recommend treatments without any assessment of value or the budget impact over the long-term. is the cost so high that it will strain state health budgets, force cutbacks in other community services or generate unaffordable increases in insurance premiums?
rather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions ― such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease ― mr. readler's brief (in the lawsuit) argued that they should be invalidated, she said in a tuesday statement announcing her opposition to his appointment.
that left the tax bill, whose passage was dubious at best. one senior republican senator lamented it would make repealing obamacare look like a piece of cake. republicans were panicking. they believed they had to notch a big legislative win if they were going to survive the coming midterm elections — and even future ones.
mcgrath outpaced her progressive challengers in two suburban northern kentucky counties that are also vital in november, and she will be buoyed by the national democratic interest in knocking off mcconnell and wresting away his control of the senate, which should help her continue to raise staggering amounts of cash. she exited the primary with nearly $20 million left, and mcgrath can point to polls to bolster hopes that she has a chance to pull off the upset. in the closing days of the primary, her campaign touted a may poll showing her running dead even with mcconnell, although national observers still rate mcconnell as the favorite to win re-election.
but most of the criticisms by democrats centered on readler's role as a top attorney and policy advisor for the justice department when it declined to defend key provisions of the affordable care act in response to a lawsuit filed by republican state attorneys general. readler made the legal argument that protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional. the next day, trump nominated him to be a federal judge.
america's unusual health care system that links coverage to jobs means that during bad economic times, people who find themselves jobless are also suddenly without protection from medical costs.

the ensuing midterms gave republicans control of the house and gave ryan, incoming chairman of the budget committee, a chance to flesh out that agenda. the resulting proposal, known as the path to prosperity, called for giving states more flexibility to administer programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program, typically referred to as food stamps.

oh, and the house bill would have slashed funding for medicaid, undermining its current guarantee of coverage and leaving 14 million low-income americans without insurance, according to the congressional budget office. during the 2017 debate, bishop cited the cbo analysis as proof that republicans were following through on the promise to lower premiums, provide major tax relief and reduce the deficit.
so, as i heard the shock of folks when donald trump defeated hillary clinton in that november 2016 presidential election, i wondered what history they had read, or not read, which america they had been living in their entire lives. for the rise of trump and the last stand of angry white men—of angry white people—are not new; for this racism is not new, not even remotely. nor is this belief system called white supremacy new, either, and nor is it solely confined to people, back then, or now, who are defined as conservatives, as racists, as not believing in the equality of us all.
of course, reducing health care spending is very much the point of health care reform and it's not difficult to make the case that hospitals are a logical place to find big savings. prices here in the u.s. are much higher than in other countries, even for everyday services like knee replacements and routine baby deliveries, with scant evidence that the care here is better.

the aca defines affordable as premiums below roughly 10% of income. but many retail workers, security guards and other low-wage workers can't afford to put 10% of their income toward health insurance. worse still, the method of calculation can make it especially difficult to get spousal or dependent coverage.
in one of the most bizarre political spectacles in memory, republican members of congress are desperately trying to convince voters that they cherish protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they pretend to be indignant that anybody would suggest they ever voted against those protections.
legal experts from across the political spectrum, including some who were vocal advocates of previous challenges to the affordable care act, have called the argument unfounded and nonsensical.
josh hawley, the republican senate candidate in missouri, says he is all about making sure anybody can get health insurance, regardless of their medical status: we need to cover pre-existing conditions, he said earlier this summer.
boston ― the trump administration's new attack on obamacare will expose consumers to surprise, sometimes staggering medical bills.
even a ruling on these less-destructive grounds would still invalidate the pre-existing condition coverage portions of the affordable care act. and health insurance markets could become inhospitable again to anyone who has been to a doctor more than a couple of times in the last decade.
insurers would have paid uva only $88 million for that care, according to an accounting of unpaid bills presented in september 2018 to the uva health board. even that unpaid figure did not come out of uva's purse since federal and state governments provided funding earmarked to cover indigent care for almost all of it — $83.7 million, according to bai.
what the ministries cover, and what they don't
both parties acknowledged our obligation to assist those who need help; an agreement at last. they also concurred that it is insurance companies and drug companies that are the bad actors in the story of escalating health care costs. both acknowledged that, as a way to gain on-board support for the affordable care act, the administration decided that the government couldn't negotiate prices with drug companies. the price they quote is the price we pay. it was ted cruz who reminded us that, since the passage of the aca, health insurance profits have doubled and insurer's margins have dramatically increased. this means that the profits on each policy sold are greater now than before the legislation was passed. yet, when it came to tackling the problem of rising costs, both looked to the uncontrolled insurance companies to provide us with a solution. neither debater proposed any controls on costs.

in a state that's been run by republicans since the 1990s and that hasn't gone for a democratic presidential candidate since president lyndon johnson's landslide win in 1964, idahoans like pratt are tired of feeling ignored ― and they're banding together in living rooms and libraries and facebook groups across the state.
the draft bill maintains the medicaid expansion as-is through the end of 2019. beginning in 2020, it maintains the enhanced federal share only for existing enrollees, while new expansion population enrollees would receive a federal share in line with the traditional 57% average. it is assumed that the enrollment freeze will result in enhanced federal share-eligible beneficiaries cycling off the rolls in 2-5 years. so, in total, the expansion would continue to grow for three years, then phase out over the next 5.

house speaker nancy pelosi blasted president donald trump's latest executive order on health care, saying his pledge to protect americans with preexisting conditions was not worth the paper it's printed on.
the idea, however, of republicans going back to the drawing board, perhaps seeking out some democrats to support their measure, doesn't look like a winning strategy. republicans are already split over a health care bill for both repealing too much of obamacare and not enough, and democrats appear completely united in their opposition to anything resembling the republican plan.
as for sinema, he said: she's defined herself. and so when the attacks actually come, do they just bounce off?

bill clark / getty images indiana's democratic sen. joe donnelly has a tricky dance to learn if he wants to be re-elected this fall in his red state.
but the possibility that a conservative like kavanaugh — a judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit who was tapped to replace former swing justice anthony kennedy and could help repeal the affordable care act, unwind women's reproductive rights and tilt the supreme court to the right for decades — has democrats up in arms. they are pointing to public comments kavanaugh made during his long involvement in conservative legal circles to insist he go on record and answer questions about how he would rule on major issues like abortion and health care.

indeed, what set the table for trump was the racist backlash to obama and those congressional members who vowed to block anything he did, those whites in power who fanned the flames of fear by placing blame on immigrants, on movements like black lives matter. those whites made it seem as if they were more patriotic, as a matter of fact, than any other group in america.
your answers don't provide me comfort, booker said in response to his answers.
sen. kirsten gillibrand (n.y.) was one of the only candidates on stage to mention ongoing republican efforts to strike down obamacare and its preexisting condition protections in the courts ― a more immediate issue than the fight over medicare for all among the presidential field.
i understand the appeal of medicare for all, biden said in the video. but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of obamacare, and i'm not for that.
the gop bill also would subject more snap recipients to stricter asset tests ― a change that would have eliminated benefits for nearly 2 million households if it had been in place in 2015, according to an analysis by mathematica policy research published thursday. the congressional budget office previously said the added work requirements would reduce enrollment by 1.2 million going forward.
but you can get a sense of how medicare for all might look in practice by looking closely at a structurally similar state-level proposal in new york that progressives have been promoting and that was the subject of a thorough analysis last year.
that would inflate the program's cost, forcing the government to raise more revenue. but there are limits to how high taxes on high earners can go, because at some point tax avoidance ― that is, people finding ways to shield income or qualify for lower rates ― makes it difficult to increase revenue.
so what does trump want to do on health care? of course, the first order of business is to entirely get rid of obamacare and its individual mandate that nearly everyone get health coverage or face a fine (a subject that recently got trump into some hot water). there's a bunch of stuff on his website complaining about obamacare, which gives trump something in common with the congressional republican leaders he likes to insult.
sen. claire mccaskill (d-mo.) lit into some her republican colleagues on thursday for writing legislation that would repeal the affordable care act behind closed doors and without formal hearings in order to rush a floor vote and pass legislation along party lines.
what makes the criticism of the cbo particularly ironic is that its current director, keith hall, was given the job by republicans after they took control of congress – largely because of his perceived friendliness to gop initiatives.
for our margins, that's a big deal, stepp said, because now we have the autonomy to fund other programs or even talk about growing and expanding.
democrats gained unified control of five more states in the 2018 elections ― meaning they hold the governor's mansion and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. and they're taking advantage of it, passing measures to strengthen voting rights, anti-discrimination measures, health care and more.
i am moving heaven and earth to safeguard our seniors from the china virus, trump said, using his usual blame-shifting term to describe the coronavirus. he also offered an optimistic assessment of the pandemic, even as a surge of new infections spreads across america.

biden should recognize this fear-mongering strategy because mcconnell and others used it extensively when president barack obama was working to enact the affordable care act in 2009 and 2010 and continued to use it to criticize the law. for a candidate so fixated on protecting obamacare and an ex-vice president who claims partial credit for obama's legislative success on health care reform, it's jarring to hear him parrot those attacks now.
in the case of the medicaid work requirements proposal, most respondents said the administration shouldn't waive program rules to allow states to add work as a condition of eligibility for certain enrollees, said elizabeth lower-basch, a senior fellow at the center for law and social policy.
fortunately for allies of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), it's been mcsally, a one-time swing-district moderate who has never publicly revealed if she voted for trump in 2016, who has broken away from the pack. while she once called trump disgusting and condemned the then-gop presidential nominee following the release of the access hollywood tape in which he bragged about committing sexual assault, she now proudly features him in tv ads.
president donald trump warned the house freedom caucus on thursday that he would work to unseat them in the 2018 midterm elections if they did not cooperate with the broader republican agenda.

again, even in a district that went for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, roskam isn't vowing to protect low-income people who are now getting health insurance free or at a very small cost. even the moderates who are taking a more aggressive tack are putting their trust in leaders to eventually come up with something that doesn't devastate their constituents.
scott mulhauser, who advised biden during the 2012 campaign, said biden's positions put him in the sweet spot where most of the democratic party could be, but also a decent amount of moderates and i'm sure some republicans.
of course, that trump was not anywhere near as successful as he claimed was not a big secret. it had been the subject of numerous articles and books over the years. and thousands of publicly available lawsuits outlined the sorts of business practices trump had used – from refusing to pay contractors what they were owed to aggressively trying to silence criticism.
mcgrath's entry into the race against mcconnell last july generated an immediate wave of national interest in kentucky's senate race. she smashed kentucky fundraising records and sparked visions of a potential democratic victory over the senate leader, who ranks, by some measures, among the least popular lawmakers in the country.

the u.s. senate voted sunday in a rare weekend session to advance amy coney barrett's nomination to the supreme court, setting up a final vote to confirm president donald trump's pick on monday, a little over a month since the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg.
but in 2018, after endorsing south florida stalwart and eight-term gop rep. mario diaz-balart in previous elections, the collier county paper endorsed democrat mary barzee flores to represent florida's 25th congressional district, which stretches from the western suburbs of miami to eastern naples. a promising new leader, the paper urged, was needed for congress to change its ways of not getting important problems solved.
these — and many, many more ― protections could all be lost if the aca is repealed. in fact, 20 million people may lose their health insurance if the supreme court strikes the law down later this month.

there are currently more than 70 members out of 435 in the medicare for all caucus, but those numbers also seem to include lawmakers who support a buy-in option for medicare, rather than eliminating private insurance entirely. and democrats have consistently shown a deference to the most vulnerable and moderate members ― the so-called majority makers.
the clip was posted by a user named young ted cruz, who told politico he obtained the video from a classmate of cruz's who wished to remain anonymous. it surfaced online less than 10 days before the iowa caucuses, where cruz is a lead contender along with real estate mogul donald trump.
regional disparities add yet another problematic layer. the south, with its high black population and its woefully inadequate public health response to hiv, has become the hotbed of the epidemic among msm.
as it happens, medicare has grown particularly slowly in the last few years, below the targets that would have triggered ipab action. but medicare costs could grow more quickly in the future. assuming the spending agreement congressional leaders announced wednesday becomes law, ipab won't be around to do anything about it.
even the architects of medicare for all plans haven't fully worked out how their systems would function. that's particularly true when it comes to money questions, like how to pay doctors and hospitals or how to finance all the new public spending it would require.
lawyers are trained to present the evidence that is most favorable for their client's position. president obama is a graduate of harvard law school. the jury is still out.
republicans seem to acknowledge that they will, at some point, need to stabilize obamacare markets. even in their bill replacing the affordable care act, there are funds that would reimburse insurers for the cost of their most expensive patients, allowing them to hold down premium increases.
his may payment of $405, for example, went to another member who had a hernia operation.
the program only lasted three years, but congress inserted a provision in the health and human services department's spending bills from 2015 to 2017 to limit payments under the risk corridors program. both the obama and trump administrations had argued that the provision means the government has no obligation to pay.
her nomination to replace the late justice ruth bader ginsburg has ground other legislative business to a halt as republicans excited by the prospect of locking in a 6-3 conservative court majority race to confirm her over democratic objections before election day.

the taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. but exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. if the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren't deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.
just this week, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) reopened the quest for the holy grail of republican government: cutting medicare, medicaid and social security to pay for tax cuts for their donors. he called the rising deficits caused by the republican tax cuts disturbing and instead placed the blame on entitlements.

the latest cdc study is actually the third in a series of cdc papers based on an ongoing series of surveys that the federal government conducts looking specifically at how people react when prescription drugs get expensive. for this installment, cdc researchers robin cohen and amy cha focused exclusively on adults with diabetes, breaking down the results by age and insurance coverage.
whether or not those figures tell the whole story, even advocates for more ambitious cuts to hospitals, like don berwick, co-founder of the institute for health innovation and a former administrator of medicare and medicaid, say there is a lot of variation from institution to institution. small and rural hospitals are highly vulnerable, berwick said. one needs to be very gentle.
but, she added, that could change over time.
the debate format was partly to blame, with so many candidates representing so many different views trying so desperately to get attention in limited time. but the candidates also bear some responsibility, and that was especially true of biden and harris, who simply seemed less familiar with health policy ― and less capable of pressing their arguments ― than either sanders and warren had been on tuesday.

the function of health care today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. the function of the health care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies, sanders said thursday. we will have medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their say is gone, that health care is a human right, not something to make huge profits on.

these plans will remain subject to the affordable care act's rules. they will not only provide the surest protection for medical bills; for many, they will remain the cheapest option, as well. that's especially true for people who qualify for tax credits that the affordable care act put in place.
at a campaign event at a public park here in heavily democratic lake county, he never mentioned trump's name in his stump speech, even as donnelly slammed two of the administration's signature achievements: nullifying obamacare's individual mandate and making sweeping changes to the tax code.
yet few opportunities for this exist.
despite the creation of the select panel, last week, the republicans chose, before even one meeting was held, to vote overwhelmingly to defund planned parenthood. as part of the reconciliation bill, they rendered a guilty verdict without any evidence.
on the medicaid expansion front, sen. john thune (r-s.d.) offered some insight into where the talks are at, saying there's an interest among many republicans to have a longer tail on [repeal] phase-out. under the house bill, the extra federal funds for medicaid expansion would phase out starting in 2020. senate republicans could push back that date or find some other way to make the transition more gradual, although, notably, the debate seems to be over when ― and not whether ― to end federal funding for the expansion.
the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing, mueller said in may, without uttering the word impeachment.
i think what we have seen in this country ― knocking other people's values, how they practice, how they want to serve god ― i've always had a real problem with that, pence said in one of his campaign videos.
exactly how many people would end up in the private option is impossible to say. roughly one-third of all seniors are in medicare advantage today and it is safe to assume that most of the nation's biggest insurers would be offering a version of this coverage under the harris plan. that could make the private option a familiar, potentially attractive source of insurance to americans who might be wary of a new government plan.
in kaiser's polls, these proposals were even more popular than medicare for all, although kaiser didn't test how these ideas held up to common conservative criticisms.
one legislator there said he wasn't worried that the ministries were outside the state insurance department's jurisdiction because, as he put it, they are self-regulating.

the proposal is called the new york health act and, like medicare for all, it would wipe out nearly all existing insurance arrangements to enroll everybody into a brand-new, state-run program. financing under the nyha would come from taxes on payrolls and non-wage income (interest, dividends, etc.).
that was house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) on tuesday, talking about the new obamacare repeal bill ― a proposal that, according to an early estimate, could make up to 10 million people newly uninsured.
republicans generally agree they want the 2010 health care law gone. it's just that many disagree over what they should replace it with.
this isn't tax cuts for the rich. this is tax cuts for everyone, he said.
when pence became governor, his opposition to abortion rights reached an unprecedented level. indiana made headlines for the punitive legislation of house bill 1337. it banned women from getting abortions when their fetus had genetic abnormalities among other restrictions. upon authorizing, pence emphasized, i sign this legislation with a prayer that god would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. even pro-life republican elected officials disparaged the bill.
medicaid enrollees in states that adopt a block grant or per-capita cap could face new barriers to care, including monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and they could be kicked off the program for failing to pay.
harris has talked up medicare for all previously, but she has frequently followed up with caveats that left her precise policy thinking ambiguous. and although she is a co-sponsor of the sanders medicare for all proposal, her new plan is different in several key respects.

aside from a court order, the best hope for the group is congress. the house has already passed a funding bill that blocks the gag rule. the road will be much steeper, if not impossible, in the gop-controlled senate. but if it's going to go anywhere, it needs to start in the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, which oversees the title x program.

pressed on whether that meant he would vote against a motion to proceed, cruz said the bill would not have the votes to go forward. the cruz amendment would allow insurers who offer at least one health plan that complies with obamacare regulations to offer other, cheaper plans that don't.
yet another attempt by the administration to screw poor people. rep. jim mcgovern (d-mass.)
the democrats now attacking republicans over pre-existing conditions don't typically acknowledge the role that the law played in driving up premiums for people who don't qualify for those generous tax credits, making comprehensive coverage flat-out unaffordable in some cases. nor do they mention that the regulations are the reason some insurers canceled old plans, despite obama's repeated promises that people who liked their coverage could keep it.
the campaign documents do not specify exactly how that part of the new system, or the other automatic enrollment features, would actually work.
but elrod questioned whether the court could really divine congressional intent, either from the law itself or from the congressional record. at one point, she wondered aloud whether maybe some republicans understood that repealing the mandate would undermine the affordable care act's constitutionality and voted to zero out the mandate as an act of cleverly disguised sabotage.

there are number of states that greatly benefit from the expansion ― states that voted for president donald trump and have heavy republican representation in congress, including kentucky, arkansas and west virginia. the key for gop leaders is to convince governors that gutting the expansion is in their interest, even when the federal government is paying at least 90 percent of the costs to cover their residents.

what do women do when they cannot prevent pregnancy and cannot access abortion care? they have more children, says diana greene foster, a professor at the university of california, san francisco, and the principal investigator on the turnaway study, which compared a cohort of women who just made the abortion eligibility time limit in their state and therefore received an abortion with those who just missed it and completed the pregnancy. data is still being sent to peer-reviewed journals, she says, but already her team has written that women who are denied an abortion are more likely to fall further into poverty than women who receive an abortion, and that they are at greater risk for anxiety.
it's unclear whether the attack ad will break through the saturated airwaves. biden and his allies are outspending trump and his allies on paid advertising more than 2 to 1 through election day, according to the advertising tracking firm kantar/cmag.
president flintstone also made his latest russiagate confession, telling fox news sycophant ainsley earhardt (this week's ranking: 11) that his tweet threatening that there might be tapes of his meetings with james comey was aimed at influencing comey's upcoming congressional testimony: when [comey] found out that there maybe are tapes out there, whether it's governmental tapes or anything else or who knows, i think his story may have changed and you'll have to look into that because then he'll have to tell what actually took place at the events.... you'll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed. earhardt sycophantically summed up trump's ramblings: it was a smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings. to which trump flinstonishly replied: well, it wasn't very stupid, i can tell you that. he added: he did admit that what i said was right and, if you look further back before he heard about that, maybe he wasn't admitting that.
but it may have taken those kinds of trade-offs to pass what was arguably the most transformative domestic policy act since lyndon b. johnson's great society, with gains the public now values so much that even republicans claim to consider them sacrosanct.
other aspects of the regulation could make coverage less comprehensive, reduce the value of the tax credit subsidies that make premiums more affordable for low- and middle-income people, and allow insurers to offer plans with fewer medical providers in their networks.
but those overall averages mask significant age variation. premiums for 64-year-olds would be 20 percent to 25 percent higher by 2026, even as they declined 8 percent to 10 percent for 40-year-olds and 20 percent to 25 percent for 21-year-olds. those prices are for policies that generally would offer fewer benefits than plans sold today on the affordable care act's exchanges.
the most important thing for this hearing, according to judiciary member pramila jayapal (d-wash.), is for mueller to just reiterate what he found.
maher said house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) had succeeded in writing a bill that somehow covered fewer people than just repealing obamacare.
the result was sky-high turnout and a narrow loss in a state where democrats had become accustomed to even highly sought-after recruits losing by substantial margins. (and abrams' result must be considered in light of kemp's influence as georgia's secretary of state on the election process. she has said that the election was not free and fair and that he enabled the systemic dismantling of our democracy.)
what the new regulations would actually mean
medicare has had its challenges, of course, but it is worth noting how happy americans have been with the program historically. less satisfied are those americans with employer-based insurance and, not surprisingly, those who lack health insurance altogether.
democrats' top priority is kicking president donald trump out of office, but to actually enact their agenda they have to win back the senate, expand their majority in the house and put more democratic governors in office.
meanwhile, coffman appears to be resolute in his commitment to repealing the landmark law. he penned an op-ed with the three other house republicans from colorado insisting that full repeal is the only way to solve the country's health care problems. and the american action network, a conservative political action committee with ties to congressional gop leadership, has announced it will spend $1.4 million on advertisements touting the republicans' plan to replace obamacare in several republican congressional districts, including coffman's.
the freedom caucus' objections to the gop obamacare replacement bill, known as the american health care act, proved decisive in killing it last friday. the legislative defeat was a major humiliation for trump and house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) who had repeatedly promised to repeal and replace obamacare, officially known as the affordable care act.
judge barrett's confirmation process has followed every rule. it's followed the constitution in every respect. we have abided by the norms and traditions dictated by our history, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said.
moore predicted the tax cuts would bring an immediate and lasting boost to the state's economy. instead, they created a disaster. as the center on budget policy and priorities has detailed, kansas state revenues fell $700 million overnight, the state's credit rating was downgraded, and brownback began slashing basic social services to balance the budget. job growth stalled out at less than half the national average. to salvage the state budget, lawmakers cut education funding so severely that some schools began to close early, and the state's supreme court ruled that the government was violating the state constitution. after five years of economic misfortune, kansas' conservative legislature reversed the tax cuts in 2017. the whole experiment is almost universally regarded as a calamity.
we often think the key to when retirement starts is how much we've saved ― but it seems it may have as much to do with health insurance.
what should congress do? if you think the affordable care act should be repaired rather than repealed, sign and amend this open letter to congress. if you think it needs to be repealed immediately, sign this version of it.
the bill's political outlook is unclear. although it passed the senate easily last month, it has run into more resistance in the house. the committee with jurisdiction tabled the bill on wednesday, though it may take it up again on monday, according to local political operatives who spoke to huffpost. eventually, the bill would need the signature of laura kelly, the democratic governor who just won her election, in part, by focusing on improving access to health care.

the legal argument against the aca stems from trump and the gop-led congress doing away with the fines people used to face under the law's individual mandate in 2017. according to the republican state officials who schemed up this legal challenge, the entire aca became unconstitutional when the fines disappeared because the mandate itself didn't.

marshall, a party-line republican who has served in congress since 2017, avoided what would have been a disastrous defeat in the gop's efforts to maintain its senate majority. he did so despite facing an onslaught of late spending from democratic and progressive groups hoping to help bollier, a former republican who left the gop two years ago, citing its hard-right turn on social issues and kansas republicans' aggressive efforts to cut taxes, which hammered public education budgets in the state.
now she'll face barr, who first won the seat in 2012 and has cruised to re-election twice. trump won the district by 15 points in 2016, but there have been positive signs for democrats locally: gray won a majority of the district's votes in his unsuccessful 2016 bid to unseat sen. rand paul (r), and this year democrats flipped one state legislative seat in a special election in a trump-supporting district. the dccc added the 6th congressional district to its list of targets in 2018 as it tries to flip at least 24 seats for democrats to regain the house majority.

the savings for lower- and middle-class workers could be substantial, as a recent report from the henry j. kaiser family foundation demonstrated. in addition, between 12 and 15 million previously uninsured americans would get coverage, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget.
