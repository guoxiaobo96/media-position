{"original": "several of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in march 2010).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's not yet clear how president-elect donald trump and congressional republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the affordable care act or obamacare. they have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the senate to fully repeal the current statute. so they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. but they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nonetheless, as tensions grow in washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. but obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. the services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the u.s. preventive services task force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal centers for disease control and prevention's advisory committee on immunization practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal health resources and services administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the change that affects the most people on an ongoing basis is likely the requirement that plans cover without cost sharing all methods of contraception approved by the food and drug administration. (there are limited exceptions for religious employers.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest, said caroline pearson, a senior vice president at avalere health.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no annual or lifetime limits on coverage", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. the health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "annual cap on out-of-pocket payments for covered services", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. in 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many employers often had an out-of-pocket limit anyway, but this guarantees protection for people with high needs, said joann volk, a research professor at georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms, who has written on this issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "consumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "no waiting periods to join a plan", "augmented": []}

{"original": "no waiting periods for coverage of pre-existing conditions", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prior to the aca, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. under the aca, that's no longer allowed. as a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "repeal could reopen the door to that prohibited practice, however.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "basic coverage standards for large-group plans", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. they aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. but the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. those that don't could face a fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "initially, the online calculator that the federal department of health and human services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the result: large employers generally no longer offer so-called mini-med policies with very skimpy benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the health law is repealed, that could change. in some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said steve wojcik, vice president of public policy at the national business group on health, a membership organization representing large employers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "although the law strengthened coverage for people in large-group plans in several ways, consumer advocates have complained about shortcomings. it aimed to ensure that coverage is affordable by requiring that individuals be responsible for paying no more than 9.69 percent of their household income for individual employer coverage, for example.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits — if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). but the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "consumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. the health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "such incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "together, these approaches could increase enrollment by roughly two million individuals, reduce average premiums by more than 20 percent and be roughly revenue neutral, the analysis by kurt giesa and peter kaczmarek says.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "1. fund the cost-sharing reduction payments for the long term", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these are payments the government makes to insurance companies as reimbursement for discounts on copayments and deductibles the companies are required by law to give to low-income customers. president trump has said he wants to end the payments — which a court has ruled are unlawful since congress never authorized them. but now lawmakers, including republican sen. lamar alexander of tennessee, chairman of the health committee, say they want congress to fund the payments through next year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "state insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018, alexander said in a statement on aug. 16. congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in september that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aca included a temporary reinsurance program that protected insurance companies from huge losses while they transitioned to the new market under the new law.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "3. strongly enforce the individual mandate", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president trump has suggested he doesn't want the internal revenue service to enforce obamacare's requirement that every person have insurance. today, individuals who can't prove they have coverage must pay a fine of $695 or more. oliver wyman's analysis shows that if the mandate isn't enforced, many young healthy people would drop their coverage.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obamacare includes a tax on health insurance companies to help offset the costs of federal subsidies that help people buy policies on the aca markets. it was in place from 2014 through 2016, but then congress passed a moratorium on the levy for this year. insurance companies are lobbying hard to ensure it doesn't return next year. oliver wyman's analysis shows that continuing that moratorium would cut premiums by about 3 percent next year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and now we're going to truth squad some of president trump's latest claims about health care - in particular, what he's said about his decision to stop paying for subsidies under the affordable care act, or obamacare. the president has called those subsidies bailouts to insurance companies, a windfall. sarah kliff joins us for a fact check. she covers health care policy for vox.com. sarah, good morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "block: and first, why don't you give us a quick review of just how these cost-sharing reduction subsidies work?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, so these are subsidies for low-income americans who buy obamacare to help make their co-payments and deductibles a little bit lower, to make it a little easier to go to the doctor. and these payments have - will continue to be paid by insurance companies, even though the government will not finance them. it is just coming out of insurance companies' own pockets at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "block: so basically, if they get reimbursed by the federal government, that is a wash? they're getting just made up for what they already paid out?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, so the federal government, you know, makes these payments each month, and insurance companies, in turn, help lower the co-payments and deductibles of their low-income consumers. what president trump is changing is he's not going to make those payments, so insurance companies have no one on the back end, you know, sending them the payment to make up for that spending.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "block: ok. so when president trump calls those payments a gift to insurance companies, are they a gift?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: i would disagree that they are a gift. you know, for one thing, they are going not necessarily to the insurance companies. they're ultimately going to low-income americans to help them afford their co-payments and afford their deductibles. so, you know, on that level, they don't seem like a bailout or a gift to the insurance companies. they are required by the law. the law requires these subsidies to be made. so they're really - you know, i see them as part of the affordable care act and not necessarily a bailout.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "block: the president has also said, sarah, that the insurance companies, in his words, made a fortune with obamacare. is that true? what do the numbers show?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: the numbers are a lot more mixed. the best data on this probably comes from the nonprofit kaiser family foundation, which looks at quarterly margins - so how much insurance companies have each quarter leftover after paying out all those claims. in 2014 and 2015, insurance companies had a quarterly margin of just about $20 a person. that's not a ton of money. it's gone up as the obamacare markets have stabilized.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2016, it was about $90 a person, so it's definitely getting better. but the insurance markets - you know, i've covered them since they launched. and they've really been a very rocky experience for insurance companies financially. they didn't know how to price at first. people were sicker than they expected. it's only in the past year that insurance companies have made decent profits there, but i think of them as a mixed bag when it comes to financial performance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "block: decent profits, which raises the question - if the insurance companies are losing the federal payments, they began compensating by jacking up the premiums for other people - right? - raising those premiums a lot - in some cases by double digits. couldn't the insurance companies just absorb the costs themselves, cut into their profits but not pass it along to consumers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, so one of the things i've learned as a health care reporter is insurance companies tend to have relatively low profit margins, usually in the 3 to 4 percent range. so there definitely is some space. but one of the things that surprised me a little bit is state regulators often are the ones saying, you have to make those increases. they're really worried that insurance companies might get hit with a big claim and not have enough money to pay for it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they want to make sure that insurance companies are getting enough revenue from their premiums to cover that loss, to make sure they can actually pay out claims. the worst-case scenario for a state regulator is to have an insurance company that just can't pay its medical bills for patients.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "a comprehensive plan could serve as a lightning rod for opponents. conversely, not having a plan for replacing some of the most popular parts of obamacare — such as its coverage protections for people with preexisting medical conditions — could leave the gop flatfooted if an administration-supported lawsuit now before the 5th circuit court of appeals were to invalidate the sweeping health law.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "right now, polls show the public is focused on health costs, says professor robert blendon, director of the harvard opinion research program, which studies public knowledge of health care and policy issues. consumers are concerned about what they pay at the pharmacy counter or about the sum of their insurance premiums and deductibles.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "nina totenberg, byline: the constitution says that the chief justice shall preside over the senate trial of a president. those who envision a powerful role for the chief justice point to senate rules that would allow him to make decisions on, quote, all questions of evidence. in theory, at least, that might enable roberts to rule on motions from the house managers seeking to compel testimony from white house aides, like former national security adviser john bolton and others who, until now, have been blocked by president trump from testifying.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "totenberg: the clinton trial was conducted in a far different time. the republican majority leader and the democratic minority leader worked closely to conduct the trial in a dignified way. and the rules for the trial were ultimately established by consensus and a unanimous senate vote. the president, while controversial, had never attacked the supreme court or the chief justice personally. and the high court membership itself had remained stable for five years without change. none of that is true today. trump's relationship with chief justice roberts has been rocky at best during the 2016 presidential campaign. trump castigated him for failing to strike down obamacare, calling him disgraceful and more here in an interview with abc's this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "donald trump: justice roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "totenberg: although the president and roberts have been cordial in their rare personal interactions. trump has repeatedly cast aspersions on the integrity of judges whose decisions he disagreed with, a practice that finally prompted a rare rebuke from roberts. and, of course, a snarky tweet from trump firing back at the chief justice. roberts, a conservative appointed to the court by president george w. bush 15 years ago, has tried mightily to convey an image of the court as apolitical.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "john roberts: our role is very clear. we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the united states and ensure that the political branches act within them. that job obviously requires independence from the political branches.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "totenberg: but that image has proved harder to maintain as the court, with the addition of two trump-appointed justices in the last two years, has veered to the right with the promise of an even more dramatic conservative turn in the near future. even as roberts will be presiding over the senate trial, he and fellow justices are hearing nearly a dozen blockbuster cases this term on issues ranging from abortion to immigration and even a series of cases in which trump is seeking to block subpoenas for his financial records.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with that menu dominating his day job, it is unlikely that roberts will want to insert himself as a major player in the impeachment trial. rather, he's likely to use as his role model the man he once clerked for - chief justice rehnquist. as presiding officer at the clinton trial, rehnquist learned to rely on the senate parliamentarians for guidance. robert schaffer was one of his law clerks back then.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "martin: so one of the revelations of your book, frankly, is that justices are not immune from political calculations about their seats. you said that that was true of the first woman on the court, sandra day o'connor, who thought a lot about that. so we've reported that one of justice ginsburg's final wishes is that her replacement not be named until there is a new president. now, the late justice could have stepped down when obama was president and the democrats controlled the senate. should she have? do you think she considered doing so? and why do you think she didn't?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kaplan: she says she did not consider doing so. and i think she didn't for two reasons. one, as she's pointed out, there was no guarantee that a replacement ever would've been confirmed. god knows we certainly saw that play out with merrick garland in 2016. the second reason is it's a great gig. most justices don't want to give it up. and the average tenure of recent justices has been close to 30 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so let's turn to the political fight ahead. and as, of course, you certainly know, in 2016, after the death of justice antonin scalia, senator mitch mcconnell made it a point to stall the nomination process until after the presidential election. now he's reversed course, saying the process will move forward. we've heard from two senators so far, saying that they don't think that that's fair and that they will follow the precedent and not vote to move ahead. that's lisa murkowski and susan collins. but what about the rest of the senate? what about the rest of the republicans in the senate, i should say?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kaplan: well, they're going to need four opponents. democrats are going to need four republicans to come forward and stick with that idea that not only will we not have a vote before election day, we won't have one until a new president's inaugurated in january. obviously, mitt romney is going to be key. and then you've got to look to someone like cory gardner in colorado. he has to make the calculation. i'm in a close race. am i going to do better by tacking toward the senate or appealing to the hard right? but i think romney will be very important. if you get to three votes, then there's a certain amount of hydraulic pressure on potential fourths. but if i were in the prediction business, i would think the desire to get another conservative on the bench and put roe v. wade and perhaps obamacare in real jeopardy is just too tempting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and, of course, republicans have been successful at making the supreme court a voting issue during presidential elections. according to the washington post, about a quarter of trump voters in 2016 said that the supreme court was the most important factor in voting for him. and that compares to 18% of democrats who said it was the most important factor. so, clearly, there sort of was a gap there. do you think that there will be a similar dynamic this year, or is it different? i mean, could it potentially work both ways? could it galvanize democrats as well this year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kaplan: it could, but republicans have surely demonstrated they're galvanizable on this issue. and every day spent over the next six weeks discussing the supreme court appointment is a boon for trump 'cause that means it's a day not spent discussing covid.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kaplan: i - predictions are always risky. i got brett kavanaugh right. i got prior ones not right. but amy coney barrett, a former notre dame professor now on the 7th circuit in the midwest, sure looks like the obvious candidate. she was one of the finalists for the seat that kavanaugh got, maybe joan larsen, also on the federal appellate bench. but if i had five bucks to place on a nominee, it would be amy coney barrett, 48, a darling of the right wing, former scalia clerk. you could come up with cases for other names, including some of the men, but that's where i'd be putting my money.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rovner: yes, that is absolutely true. the law has been on the edge of elimination several times. the first big threat was a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the requirement for most americans to either have insurance or pay a fine, the so-called individual mandate, that went to the supreme court in 2012. and to the surprise of many, it was upheld with the pivotal vote of chief justice john roberts. here was president obama on that june day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: the highest court in the land has now spoken. we will continue to implement this law, and we'll work together to improve on it where we can. but what we won't do, what the country can't afford to do, is refight the political battles of two years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: well, of course, that's not what happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: most republican governors refused to cooperate in their states. they didn't set up their own insurance marketplaces. they wouldn't do any marketing so people could know that insurance was available and affordable. they could get subsidies if they signed up. but most critically, at least in the first years, most of them didn't expand the medicaid program for people with low incomes, which the supreme court ruling had made optional. so even right now in some really big states like texas and florida, there are millions of people who were supposed to be able to get medicaid coverage under the law but instead are still uninsured.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rovner: well, it has weathered an awful lot of storms. and there's yet another lawsuit that the supreme court will hear in the next term that could again get the entire law struck down. it was brought by a group of republican state attorneys general. ironically, the trump administration is supporting that lawsuit even as the affordable care act is being used right now to lessen the impact of the coronavirus crisis.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rovner: well, at least nine states have reopened their affordable care act marketplaces to help enroll people who didn't sign up for insurance and now think they might want it. i should point out that if you lose your job and your health insurance, you're automatically entitled to sign up for coverage mid-year under the law. meanwhile, california announced friday that its exchange, which had been open for reasons unrelated to the outbreak, will continue to allow residents to enroll through june because of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus. the trump administration could choose to reopen enrollment nationwide if it wanted to, and there are reports it's considering doing just that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rovner: well, as i mentioned earlier, despite its name, the affordable care act did a lot more to fix problems with insurance coverage than it did to actually make health care affordable. ten years later, people are still complaining about premiums and co-pays and surprise medical bills. people still declare bankruptcy because of medical bills. and most significantly for this crisis, many people with insurance say they still avoid seeking medical care because they worry about what it might cost. and public health experts say that's a big problem and one you're not seeing in most of the other countries dealing with the crisis at the same time. what you don't want is americans with coronavirus not getting tested or seeking care if they should and then spreading the virus to others.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to expand coverage, biden has proposed two major initiatives. in addition to the medicare eligibility change, he wants congress to approve a government-run health plan that people could buy into instead of purchasing coverage from insurance companies on their own or through the obamacare marketplaces. insurers helped beat back this public option initiative in 2009 during the congressional debate over the aca.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the eligibility age has been set at 65 since medicare was created in 1965 as part of president lyndon johnson's great society reform package. it was designed to coincide with the age when people at that time qualified for social security. today, people generally qualify for early, reduced social security benefits at age 62, but full benefits depend on the year you were born, ranging from age 66 to 67.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "luthra: certainly. so this is a really interesting sort of natural development in how we think about ways to expand access to health care. and you could break this down into the medicare for all single-payer plan that bernie sanders has put forward that's now also backed by elizabeth warren in which everyone would get their health care from this one, big government program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they would call it medicare. it looks very different from medicare as we know it, right? it would cover dental. it would cover prescription drugs. it would cover vision. basically, everything that you can think of would be taken care of. you would pay nothing at the point of service, so when you go to the doctor, no copay. it would eliminate private insurance. they say that would make it more efficient.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then you have someone like former vice president joe biden, who says he wants to add to the affordable care act, create what's called a public option in which if you don't have access to health care, you can buy into a government program. he would also add some other consumer protections here and there and try and put a cap on how much we pay out-of-pocket for health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then you also have plans from folks like kamala harris, who has said that she backs medicare for all but has been sort of trying to thread the needle on maintaining a private insurance option. and she rolled out a plan just this past week looking at the idea of expanding medicare to everyone but giving the option of either getting it from this government program or letting private insurance companies contract with the government. and she says that she would put stricter standards on those companies than exist today said that you have better plans but you have choice.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "grandoni: there is some regional divide here. you have some people in the moderate camp when it comes to climate change from the center of the country, places like colorado or montana that have coal and oil natural gas resources. so in that category, you have governor steve bullock from montana and former governor john hickenlooper from colorado as well as senator michael bennet from colorado. this makes up that kind of moderate section of the democratic party when it comes to climate change - and other issues - where they want the country to move more towards renewable resources, but they want oil and natural gas to play some sort of role in the energy mix in the foreseeable future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: do we have a sense of where voters are on these issues?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "domenico montanaro, byline: hey, michel. thanks for having me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: well, you know, i've framed it a certain way. how would you frame that difference of opinion that we saw playing out on the stage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montanaro: well, you know, loosely, i think it is the progressives versus the pragmatists - you know, the pragmatists being the types of people like former vice president biden, to a lesser extent obviously someone like former congressman john delaney, who we heard that big back-and-forth with senator elizabeth warren from massachusetts. you know, the biden campaign - i was talking to some of their senior advisers before the second debate while i was in detroit, and they are very focused on putting forward policies that have majority support in a general election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that doesn't just mean winning over trump voters - that means winning over those independents and people who may be swaying. that's through a prism of believing that this is still a persuasion election, which 2016 frankly was. but a lot of liberals in response to donald trump don't see that as enough. they want more, and they don't see someone like vice president biden as the future of the party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: is there any evidence that either of these strategies work better with voters? you heard the former obama chief of staff, former mayor of chicago rahm emanuel was on one of the late-night shows after the debates, and he said that democrats want to fall in love, republicans fall in line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montanaro: ...over the years for sure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: he wasn't making a particular case one way or the other. but the stereotype is that democrats really want to be inspired by something. that's how you get the democratic base fired up. whereas other people say no, that that's not true, and they point to the obama voters who switched to trump in 2016.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montanaro: well, you know, this is going to be the argument that we're not going to be able to solve. is this going to be a persuasion election, or is this an election where it's just a base election? and there's a lot of evidence to suggest that president trump is trying to get the democratic base and independents to stay home because his base is solidly behind him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, some would argue, like rahm emanuel, that that means that there's an opportunity to win over the people who president trump has not gone beyond to try to win over and keep on board. despite the strong economy, the president has mediocre approval ratings, and that is a huge opportunity for democrats. now, can a democratic base only beat a conservative base only? polling would suggest no because there are fewer people who identify as liberal, and there are more people who identify as conservative. so democrats have to win over a degree more of moderate voters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and, finally, did you observe a difference of opinion about whether this election is a referendum on president trump, or is it a referendum about the plans and the biographies of the democratic candidates?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montanaro: well, look - all of these candidates are democrats, and they're looking in, you know, moving the country in a direction that's a little more liberal than where it is now - or a lot more liberal, depending on which candidate you're talking about. but when you talk to these voters on the campaign trail, over and over again, they say their main priority is beating donald trump. they just want him out whatever way that they can effect that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so what that seems to suggest - that there was - that democratic primary voters are willing to give wide latitude to very different policy procedures as long as the person is fit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montanaro: i think that's absolutely true. i mean, you have something like 80% of democratic voters saying they're not decided on who the candidate is, but they definitely know that they want to win. and they're worried about it because the economy is strong. there's no hot war where you have a rising death toll every day. and with those circumstances, generally a president is re-elected. and i think there's a lot of democrats biting their nails and even more so watching these debates not sure who it is that they think is definitely that person that they think, you know, can really take him on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the senate bill would cancel out the penalty imposed by the affordable care act on individuals who do not have health insurance. sen. susan collins, r-maine, is seeking further legislation be taken up to shore up insurance markets in exchange for this measure, which would give republicans a small victory in their failed struggle to repeal large parts of the law.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that means republicans can pass the bill on their own. but it also means they have to stick to strict rules that say the legislation can't increase the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. they also have to make sure the tax cuts don't add to the deficit at all after that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the congressional budget office has produced scores estimating that the tax bill in its original form would add $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years. it has also said the provision to cancel out the affordable care act's mandate for individuals to have health insurance would reduce deficits by $318 billion, as millions fewer people are enrolled in medicaid and the individual market, where the federal government offers subsidies for lower-income consumers.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the prosecutor is referring to the financier jeffrey epstein. he pleaded not guilty to those charges in court monday. epstein, though, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the state of florida back in 2008, and that was part of a plea deal which protected him from major jail time.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: according to prosecutors, how large was this conspiracy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lawrence: well, the indictment they unsealed is only covering a period of three years, and that was 15 years ago. but they clearly think that there are more victims and that epstein sort of continued this pattern of behavior, that he recruited a network of young girls who would then bring in other young girls for money to give him these nude massages, which turned into sexual abuse. here's special agent bill sweeney talking about the impact of these crimes alleged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bill sweeney: those who have been victimized by child sexual predators are frequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into their adulthood, often for the rest of their lives. they bear the burden of someone else's criminal behavior.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: quil, we were reading yesterday this indictment that referred to dozens of victims, and then after hearing of dozens of victims, it's really quite sobering to hear the prosecutor say, we don't even know how many more of you there may be. if you think you're a victim, call this 800 number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lawrence: yeah, the most dramatic part for me of that press conference yesterday was that they put up a picture of epstein and they said, if you have seen this man, if you think you've been harmed by this man, call this fbi 800 number. so they think that this behavior went on for years and years and there must be many more victims.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they found - after arresting him, when he landed at this new jersey airport, they found that - they got a warrant to break into his home, his mansion in the upper east side of manhattan. and they found, they said, a trove of nude photographs, which they believe are underage girls. so that's also, i would imagine, child pornography charges on top of the other charges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: other than entering a not guilty plea, have you heard anything from epstein's side about how he would say he is not guilty of these charges?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lawrence: only that he's retained a high-powered law firm. we don't know that he - you know, he said he's not guilty, and there's a bail hearing on thursday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: we've also heard that epstein is very, very well-connected, which has forced some very prominent people to make statements about their links to him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lawrence: yes. the clinton - the office of former president bill clinton, it sort of detailed the times that they were together and said that it was all accompanied by secret service and that he knew nothing of epstein's terrible crimes, he said. president trump hasn't said anything, although in the past, he had said that epstein was a, you know, fun guy who seemed to like younger women. alex acosta, who's president trump's secretary of labor, had signed off on this plea deal in florida, which allowed him to escape prison time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what we're looking for next really is whether he will have a chance at bail. epstein has a private jet. he landed in new jersey from paris on saturday in this private jet. and the prosecutors are saying that he's just so powerful and wealthy, and that he's an extreme flight risk, and he should remain in detention throughout trial.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "martin: her name is carrie lam, and she had previously suspended this measure. protesters, though, weren't satisfied. so now she says the bill is dead. though she still hasn't formally withdrawn it. her latest step is another win for protesters who have faced long odds in all this. under china's complicated system for controlling hong kong, carrie lam is not really elected by the people; she's chosen under a system that's dominated by beijing. in the end, though, protesters forced the chief executive to answer to them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: how significant is this statement by carrie lam?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccarthy: well, i have to say, taken as a whole, it sounds like a kinder, gentler way of saying no to the protesters and their demands, and this in the face of the biggest challenge to the beijing-controlled hong kong government in decades. lam sounds like she's trying to stop the turmoil, which she even admits her government started when it pushed this extradition measure. and here's what she said today about the fate of that bill, recognizing that there is a problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chief executive carrie lam: there are still lingering doubts about the government's sincerity or worries whether the government will restart the process in the legislative council. so i reiterate here, there is no such plan. the bill is dead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: julie, help me understand a thing you said there. in listening to the entirety of her statement, you felt that in some way she's also pushing back on the protesters and trying to reject some of their demands. what do you mean by that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccarthy: well, it sounds like it's an unambiguous statement, but there's a lot of semantics involved here, especially for the protesters. the demonstrators said today, the word dead or suspending the bill - another term she's used - has no legal meaning in the legislative council, hong kong's parliament; withdrawal does, so use it (ph) - she won't. instead, when she spoke in cantonese, she used the word - she used an idiom that means to die in one's bed at a ripe, old age, and the implication is that this bill will not be revived in this session and therefore would simply die at the start of next year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, protesters say, if you're sincere, why the aversion to withdrawing it now? and, you know, beyond the bill, she's rejected all of their other demands today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok, so we should think of this as another half step back, not a complete capitulation to the protesters. and you said other demands - what other demands do the protesters make to carrie lam?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccarthy: well, the demonstrators want amnesty for the protesters who've been arrested. lam says no, the department of justice has got to take its course with no intervention. demonstrators want authorities to retract the word riot to describe the protests. she says, i never - i don't refer to the protesters that way. and the demonstrators demand an independent inquiry into allegations that the police used excessive force. lam says a fact-finding by the police complaints commission can do that. demonstrators say no, they can't (inaudible) all witnesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: and i guess there was also a demand that carrie lam herself resign. she gave no indication she's doing that, did she?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccarthy: no, she did not, and that's not likely to happen. she may at some point be recalled by beijing, which is watching this very carefully. she's under a great deal of pressure from china to rein in the social upheaval.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: the affordable care act is on trial today - again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: yeah, the case is texas v. the united states, and it's yet another lawsuit meant to overturn president obama's signature law. it is nearly a decade old at this point, and it survived two previous challenges that ended up in the supreme court. today's hearing is in the 5th circuit court of appeals in new orleans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: on the line now from new orleans is noam levey of the la times, who's covering the trial. good morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: how does this suit differ from other legal challenges to the affordable care act, the many other legal challenges?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levey: well, the crux of this case, which is different than the two other ones that have come before the supreme court to some extent, is the requirement that americans have health insurance. that was what brought about the first suit against the affordable care act. but now there is no more penalty on americans who have health insurance. and so texas and a group of other mainly republican-led states have sued, saying without the mandate, you can't have the rest of the affordable care act. the trump administration...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: let me just make sure i figure this out because, i mean, there has been news about this in a lower court ruling, but i want to review it because it's quite remarkable. there was a mandate that was characterized - that was upheld by the supreme court because it was a tax. the federal government could use its taxing authority to penalize you if you did not have health insurance. then the mandate was thrown out by congress. and so now the argument is that without the tax, without the tax penalty, there is no authority under congress to mandate health insurance for people - is that right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levey: that's right. and then the additional piece here, which is so important to this case in new orleans, is that the states suing here are arguing that because that penalty, that tax penalty was so critical to the affordable care act's program for extending health insurance, for guaranteeing sick people could get health insurance, for expanding medicaid, so critical to all the reforms in the affordable care act, that if you get rid of that penalty, you've got to take the whole law down with it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: let's hypothetically say the appeals court would agree to that, and ultimately, maybe the supreme court would agree to that. what would it mean for a law that's now almost a decade old to just be completely obliterated from the books? does anybody have any idea what that would look like?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levey: i mean, it's hard to even imagine how disruptive that would be to the american health care system. so i think people probably understand at this point that the affordable care act is responsible for extending health insurance coverage to some 20 million previously uninsured americans. but that's really just the tip of the iceberg, if you will. the law has now, as you said, been in place almost a decade. it now guarantees coverage. people have been used to getting coverage if they are sick. without that guarantee, presumably insurers could go back to denying coverage to people who are sick. twenty million - 20-some odd million people who have health insurance would lose it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: is the court in a situation where it could even consider the consequences of this? can they say, this would be an utterly absurd ruling and therefore we can't make it, or do they simply have to say, if they decide they agree with the plaintiffs in this, the law is what the law is, and let the chips fall where they may?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levey: well, this is just the next step in this lawsuit's journey. so this court can weigh in however it sees fit, and then, of course, we would expect that it may end up once again before the u.s. supreme court.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: the administration has to be prepared for examination and oversight by a house that will now have subpoena power over them, whatever they may say about it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: openly doing whatever they can to undermine it - they've been pretty frank about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: that's true (laughter). and you'd also expect them to investigate whether what the administration has been saying about how it's handling family separation along the border is true. you might well expect them to look into the president's decision to send troops to the border on the eve of the election to deal with the migrant caravan that's hundreds of miles away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: i want to note one additional point, then take it over to scott detrow as we wait for president trump, who will be making a statement at the white house shortly. reporters are already in their seats. ron klain, a longtime obama administration aide, is writing in the washington post to democrats, take your time with those investigations. it's going to take a while anyway. try to actually pass substantive things that matter to people. and he raises a few suggestions such as raising the minimum wage, shoring up the affordable care act or dealing with voting rights and that sort of thing. scott detrow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: yeah. i think we're going to hear president trump declare victory and say that this was a big win for him. yes, the republicans did add to their majority in the senate. and that's a big deal on a couple different fronts, among other things. majority leader mitch mcconnell says his top priority for the next two years is going to be the same priority as these two years, and that's confirming as many federal judges that president trump nominates as he can. it'll be easier for mcconnell to do that. and he said, frankly, they'll have more senate floor time to do that since he doesn't anticipate a lot of agreement with a democrat-controlled house in terms of trying to pass bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this was a really big night for democrats. and the fact that they flipped control of the house of representatives is a really big deal. first of all, this is a national referendum in the way that the senate election wasn't because as we talked a lot about, the senate map was a historically tough map for democrats - a ton of states deep red, where president trump is very popular. and the fact that democrats were able to keep seats in the three states that made trump president - wisconsin, pennsylvania and michigan...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: ...i think tempers the idea that this is a big victory for trump, even though, again, good on the senate side to pick up seats. but the fact that democrats were able to regain control of the house of representatives, even with so many of these seats drawn in a way by republican legislatures to make it hard for democrats to do that, i think, says a lot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: that is an important point, scott detrow. democrats, in order to win the house, had to not just win the popular vote but win it big. and it appears, by all accounts, that they did - seven or eight points, something like that, which is a pretty substantial win in a divided country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: scott, talk a little bit about the democratic - sorry, the demographics of how this all played out. we heard a lot about suburban voters, the importance of them, the importance of women voters. what were some of the trends that we saw across the country?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: the trend was that democrats retook control of the house of representatives by and large through the suburbs. seat after seat that had been in republican hands for sometimes generations - i'm thinking of one suburban houston district that was once held by george h.w. bush, hadn't sent a democrat to congress in decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: a democrat won there. philadelphia suburbs, miami suburbs - basically every big city, you could probably find one or two republican control districts that flipped to democratic control. that was the main way that democrats retook control of congress. and they did it by winning a lot of independent voters, by winning a big chunk of women voters and by picking off several republican voters who seemed to clearly be uncomfortable with the type of hard-line, anti-immigration fearmongering that president trump really leaned into in the final weeks of the campaign that he credits for helping keep republican senate seats.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: yeah. i mean, the way the president is going to read this is that candidates who did not hug him closely lost. now, those candidates also happened to be in districts that demographically are not trump country. but the white house interpretation of this is this is president trump's party, and people who lost didn't hug closely enough to him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: the one good counterpoint to that is a surprise democratic win in south carolina's 1st congressional district where the republican candidate katie arrington lost. and that's after, in the primary, she defeated mark sanford by basically saying, you're not pro-trump enough; you do not back the president as much as you should; i will be the trump candidate. that's how she won the primary. it lost her the general election. same goes for dean heller who made a very dramatic pivot from trump skeptic to standing onstage next to president trump in the final week saying, mr. president, everything you touch turns to gold. that did not keep him a senate seat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: let's note another factor in these results and something that broke in the president's favor or the republicans' favor. there is the issue of race. the president and his party in many specific places injected race into this campaign in various ways. the president's own aides put out an ad that was deemed so racist that various networks, including fox, declined to air the ad or stopped airing the ad. and the president went to campaign on behalf of republicans in georgia and florida who were running for governor against african-americans. and in one case in florida, he said the african-american running for governor, andrew gillum, was not equipped to be governor. a remarkable amount of racial language. we don't know that the president is going to be asked about that at the news conference that we expect shortly at the white house. but it is absolutely in the air that this was part of the campaign. we don't know that it particularly hurt the president anywhere. where there's an argument to be made, it might've helped the president in a few places whatever that says about the electorate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: and the smaller republican conference in the house by and large lost a lot of the trump critics, the moderate republicans who did not like that approach. and you have a republican party in both chambers that's now much more in president trump's image and style of kind of populism and culture wars as opposed to limited government. and at the same time, you have a democratic party that is increasingly diverse. a ton of first-time candidates coming in. you have the first muslim woman elected. you have indian-americans coming. you have two women under the age of 30 elected to congress. so that divide is just increasingly clear of a younger, more diverse demographic democratic party and an older and whiter republican party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: and yet, we had republicans on the show this morning saying that they could not figure out why the president throughout these midterms was not hammering harder on how well the economy is doing. and i know that you guys were both out on the trail talking to voters and - as were steve and i. and it was one of the first things you heard from people who support president trump. the economy's doing great, so i'm sticking by the guy. and i wonder as we go forward, do you think president trump will come around to the idea that he should play to his strengths, a low unemployment rate and economy that for the moment is booming in most sectors, many sectors?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keith: and so, you know, this strategy of taking a very hard line, in particular, on immigration is something that has worked for president trump in 2016. the lesson he's absolutely going to take from these results is that at least in the senate, it worked in 2018. i have done an analysis of the president's tweet endorsements, though, before he comes out to this press conference and fully declares a great night. of the 84 candidates that he endorsed - this is house, senate and governor - 84 that he endorsed, 40 won, 31 lost and 13 races have not yet been called.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keith: well, so here's the thing about infrastructure. since president trump won in 2016, democrats or republicans have at times said, you know, infrastructure, that could be something where we come together. and it just hasn't happened. you know, president trump has had something like four different infrastructure theme weeks, which have all turned into very weird weeks completely unrelated to infrastructure. and the real problem with infrastructure - everybody talks about it - is that they agree more or less on maybe building roads. they don't agree on how to fund it. they don't agree on the mix of transit versus, you know, roads...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: ...and bridges. and it - you know, there's - although the sort of headline seems like something where there could be room for agreement, you know, transportation bills - big transportation bills that used to be bipartisan haven't been for the last five, six, seven years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: let's explain what the partisan divide is here. in the broadest terms, if you're a republican, you like private funding for highways. and if you're democratic, you like public funding for trains. that's an oversimplification, but that's kind of where it goes. is that right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: yeah. yeah. and maybe gas taxes, too, somewhere in there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok. ok. mitch mcconnell used another phrase i want to ask about, scott detrow, presidential harassment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: he seems to have said it several times. what does that mean, presidential harassment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: democrats will call that oversight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: mcconnell did point something out, though, that - a lot of - i know a lot of democratic leaders are thinking about, though. he said if you go back to 1998, republicans, when they had control of the house and bill clinton was president, leaned very into presidential harassment, as he put it. impeachment was the term that they used at the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: they went full-bore, investigating every nook and cranny of president clinton's life. and in the end, president clinton had a 65 percent or so approval rating. and republicans lost seats in the last midterm. mitch mcconnell brought that up and said that's worth democrats thinking about. i don't think many - well, in terms of impeachment, i know democratic leaders are very wary of going down that road. they can look at the result of winning back control of the house of representatives and say, you know, a lot of the candidates that put us back in control of the house were moderates who focused on local issues, focused on things like health care and kept the idea of trying to impeach president trump at arm's length. the line from nancy pelosi and other top democrats were, well, we'll just have to see what robert mueller's investigation leads to, and we'll go from there. but especially now that republicans have control of the senate by larger margins, the idea of going down the road to impeachment would kind of be a bridge to nowhere to use another term from the political past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: well, it's interesting, and the results seem to bear that out. i mean, it was centrist democrats that did really well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: the progressive democrats, the ones who even in - you know, who were willing to invoke the word impeachment, they did not fare as well last night, which really seems to be saying something about - i don't know - maybe some cohesion in the party, some agreement about, you know, things that can be discussed and things that can't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: here's a weird split track, though, on the progressive front. progressive issues did great. in three republican states, medicaid expansion passed as referendum. several other progressive referendums passed as well. and at the same time, the progressive candidates - the ones who got the most attention at least - did not fare well. so i think a lot of democrats are trying to sort out what exactly this means for messaging and approach to presidential races among other things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: can i just mention - we've all been out and talking with a lot of voters this fall. and you folks can share your experiences, but i'm thinking of people that i spoke with in about four states over the last several weeks. and there were one or two people who raised the mueller investigation and protecting the mueller investigation and concern about russia. but people were much more likely to talk about health care and raise their concerns about medicare or medicaid or to talk about how obamacare benefited them. and that was evident in what the individual candidates were saying, not just the democrats but the republicans - because as we've covered on the air, there were a lot of republicans who, despite their past votes against obamacare, despite their lawsuits to overturn obamacare, during the campaign, proclaimed their support for a key provision of obamacare, the protection of people with pre-existing conditions, which suggests, i think, there are a lot of people - for all the millions of people who are upset about president trump or profoundly supportive of president trump, there are a lot of people in this country who are not as engaged or engaged in a different way or would just like something practical out of this situation for their lives or for their country and are thinking in a different way than those who are the most intense partisans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: well, one of the things i thought was so interesting, steve, when i was reporting in northern minnesota in the 8th district there, which flipped to the republican...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: ...you know, people had a lot of concerns about health care, but they were all over the place. it was really hard to get people to pin down exactly what they were worried about. we heard, you know, i have elderly parents and i'm worried about them, i have kids, i'm worried about losing my insurance. but it really did illustrate how complex health insurance is, how difficult it is to make an issue because everybody's got different worries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i suppose that's maybe one of the reasons why, you know, the democrats focus on it. to them, it seemed very productive, but to a lot of americans, it's just still really confusing, isn't it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: you've just touched on the reason that it was such a landmine for democrats to step on when they passed obamacare in the first place, that it's very difficult to explain what you're doing, it's very difficult to persuade people that it's a good thing for them, and for their neighbors, and for their family members and anybody else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: well, and the interactions that a lot of people have with insurance, at least, are not always very positive. you know, they find out that their insurance is more expensive than they thought or covered less than they thought. and for years, any negative interaction that anyone had with the affordable care act was blamed - or had with their health care system as a whole was blamed on the affordable care act. this cycle, democrats began trying to turn that around. and in some ways, they succeeded by talking about the positives in a way that they were afraid to do in years' past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: well, let's talk about the way that this election has changed the republican party. we've already touched on it. scott detrow, you were pointing out that some of the more moderate republicans - or let's just say some of the republicans who wanted to embrace the demographic changes in the country - lost their seats. carlos curbelo in florida comes to mind. and there are some others we could talk about. nevertheless, there were some republicans, obviously, who won big races. and that moves the party in a different direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one classic example comes to mind as we await president trump's remarks today is in tennessee, where bob corker, who had sometimes been a critic of the president - sometimes a quite sharp critic of the president - retired and is replaced by marsha blackburn, who is a lawmaker who has been much more supportive - openly and vocally supportive of the president. so she goes to the united states senate, which is not only a little more republican, it appears, but also a little more trumpy, if that's the proper adjective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: absolutely. look through all, so far, of the republicans who have picked off democratic incumbents in the senate. mike braun in indiana won his primary by saying, essentially, i am the donald trump in this republican primary field. i'm a businessman. i'm anti-establishment. so on and so forth. josh hawley, who defeated claire mccaskill in missouri, repeatedly embraced president trump, repeatedly appeared next to him at rallies, ran a very trump-focused campaign. you mentioned marsha blackburn. it goes on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so sub out the bob corkers and the jeff flakes, who were very quick to criticize president trump, even though democrats, especially democrats living on twitter, always pointed out that they never really backed up their words with actions. but you're losing several of them. you're gaining people who are going to reflexively back the president on almost everything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one area where you may see a pretty early example of what that shifted dynamic means is, if president trump decides in the coming months that he's had enough of attorney general jeff sessions and decides to fire him or ask for his resignation, i think it's now going to be a lot easier for the senate to confirm a new attorney general. for most of the past two years, you had republicans in the senate signaling to the white house, don't fire jeff sessions, we're not going to confirm another attorney general. that dynamic, i think, is gone.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keith: that's correct. that's the east room. it's a much bigger venue for holding a press conference than the white house press briefing room and tends to be where these - you know, president trump doesn't like to follow precedent set by his predecessors, but in this case, he is doing exactly what past presidents have done on the day after midterms.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok. and as we await the president stepping out, let's just review what has happened, what we have learned in the last 24 hours as the election results have become clear. it is clear that democrats have won the house. it appears they'll be up around 230 votes for the democrats in the house. they needed 218 to be a majority. there's still a couple of races we're not entirely sure about. there are a couple of races we're not entirely sure about on the senate side, but republicans have clearly gained there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we should mention - i think we haven't mentioned much - democrats won a senate seat in nevada. dean heller, republican, is down. we did mention it once or twice here, but it's worth underlining. however, republicans won in more conservative and rural places - north dakota and missouri and indiana. scott detrow?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: and the republican candidate in florida is ahead by the slimmest of margins, and that could be headed to a recount. recount in florida - nice flashback for everyone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: oh, my gosh. i'm having flashbacks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: it's the way to do it. it's the way - but it's the law in florida. i mean, bill nelson, the democrat who seems to be on the losing side, has already said, we're heading to a recount. but it appears to be the law if when the counting is done it is less than half a percentage point. although, it is pretty close to half a percentage point, which is a lot of votes in a state as big as florida.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: about 30,000 votes separating them right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: it does make you wonder. we've talked throughout this midterm campaign season about republicans who feel like they no longer have a home in the party. you know, we spoke to someone this morning, max boot, a former conservative, a former lifelong republican conservative commentator, who has abandoned the republican party and is urging others to do so, as well, because he just cannot abide by president trump's rhetoric and his behavior. why don't we play a clip of that? in fact, we don't have that clip from max boot. but, scott, tam, i'm curious. what happens to republicans without a party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: where do they go? yeah. what does the wilderness look like?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: well, i think that's a good question. i think we're going to look to see if any of those republicans tries to challenge president trump in the 2020 republican primaries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: someone like jeff flake, for example.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: or john kasich, the now outgoing governor of ohio. they would have a very hard road, but i think a small, vocal handful of republicans have been so critical of the president but haven't taken that drastic step of actually confronting him in that sort of way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: we should note presidents like jimmy carter, george h.w. bush, who were incumbents who ran for re-election and had a primary challenge, they weathered the primary challenge. but it signaled their weakness. it was difficult. it cost them a lot of energy, a lot of money. and those two presidents lost in the end.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: the difference, though, would be that they were challenged from their base side. and this would probably be from the moderate side, the more bipartisan approach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: and you would have to ask, are those votes even there in a republican primary, or have they gravitated to the democratic side?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: president trump expected to start speaking in just a couple of minutes. tam keith, i wonder. do you think that the president, when he speaks this morning, will admit to any kind of vulnerability whatsoever? or is this sheerly going to be, you know, a sort of self-congratulatory talk?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: i don't think that he would be having a press conference if he felt like he didn't have something positive to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: he is not someone who admits defeat. he is someone who had multiple business bankruptcies and said they were a good thing, that he came out ahead. he, when the health care bill went down, said, oh, no, this is great, this is actually a positive. his approach to life - i was speaking to one of his biographers today - is just not to accept defeat. it's to brand, re-brand and market and say, i'm the winner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: and that's going to be the key difference here because bill clinton, george w. bush and barack obama all walked down that hallway in the white house to the east room the day after a midterm where they lost control of the house and were contrite and said that i'm willing to work with the other party. i don't think, based on the tweets we've seen this morning, that president trump is going to strike that tone at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: no. you know, we had george w. bush say that there was a thumpin'. president obama said that he got shellacked. and you're simply not going - you know, president trump is going to say that he defied history.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: and he has always also laid the groundwork, has he not, by pointing out that there were just too many house districts for him to personally campaign for them and what he actually focused on was senate races? and he didn't win every senate race that he campaigned in, but he campaigned in some. and we should also take note that for a while there, the president was also campaigning in house races. he campaigned in the 6th district in kentucky, just to give one example. but later on, when it became very, very clear that democrats were likely to win the house, he noted his lack of involvement in that particular race.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: yeah. in the last week, he really shifted course. earlier in the month of october, he had been campaigning for house candidates, and then he decided that he wanted to campaign for winners. or what the white house would say is that he wanted to campaign for candidates that were statewide where he felt like he had a better chance of helping them because these were trump states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and just to go back to my numbers on this, based on the candidates that he endorsed on twitter, there are still some undecided races, but his record is 24 and 18 in the house. so 24 wins to 18 losses. in the senate, he's nine wins to six losses. and with governors, it's 7-7. so there very much is - it's not some overwhelming victory that - i mean, he simply, he did lose a lot of seats, including people that he endorsed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: yeah. we should be clear about what's going on here because we mentioned the president's arrival was imminent. that is, in fact, what we were told quite some time ago. a news conference was originally scheduled for about 11:30 eastern time, which is 27 minutes ago. and as soon as that begins, we'll take you to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but meantime, we do have an opportunity to review an awful lot of significant results and races around the country. we've talked about the national level. perhaps we should talk, while we wait on the president a little bit, about the state level. for starters, democrats have gained, so far, how many governorships, scott detrow? about seven?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but he also took some questions from reporters. it was the first time reporters were able to ask him directly about the election and kind of get his take on the president refusing to concede. and as you noted, he says nothing is going to slow down their process even though the trump administration is blocking his team from receiving things like classified reports and important transition funding. he actually downplayed the idea of taking any legal action to force the matter. and he said the standoff is probably hurting trump and his legacy more than him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: what did he say about senate republicans who, again, in denial of reality, have mostly been backing up president trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ordoñez: yeah, biden said he hadn't spoke to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, for example, but that he expects to soon. he was kind of solemn on this note and scolded republicans about the hold that trump has on the party. he said they were intimidated by trump. there are a few - and it seems to be a growing number of republicans, though - who are breaking with the president. but biden was asked very directly about how he could work with republicans who will not even acknowledge him as president-elect. and he just kind of smiled. he said, they will; they will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: makes you wonder if president trump was watching that. have we heard anything from the trump campaign?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ordoñez: trump himself has been mostly quiet other than on twitter. the campaign announced that it was filing a new federal lawsuit in michigan, seeking to block the certification of election results until a review could be done. and it's just one of a series of legal challenges the campaign is pursuing. many of them have already failed in a court, as we have reported. secretary of state mike pompeo also took some very pointed questions about the transition from the press yesterday. he insisted there will be a smooth transition - but for a second term of the trump administration. so they're not giving up yet.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ordoñez: yeah. i mean, he's telling them that america's back and that the united states, as he says, is back in the game. biden has routinely criticized, you know, trump's america first approach to foreign policy, arguing that acting unilaterally has hurt the united states. he said yesterday that he had talked to six world leaders so far, including chancellor angela merkel of germany, president emmanuel macron of france and prime minister boris johnson of the united kingdom, who was a trump ally. you know, trump has yet to concede, but all of them are telling biden that they look forward to working with him.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "king: all right. the affordable care act looks like it will survive another challenge in the supreme court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: that's right. so yesterday, the court signaled that even though obamacare might have some legal problems, it's unlikely that a majority of justices will vote to throw out the entire law. president-elect biden talked about the high stakes in this court case.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "king: all right. so this was the third time that the supreme court has heard a significant challenge to the affordable care act. what happened yesterday?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "johnson: texas and a big group of other red states argued that since congress had zeroed out the financial penalty for not having insurance, also known as the individual mandate, that meant the whole law needed to go. but those arguments got a somewhat chilly reception from two conservative justices. trump appointee brett kavanaugh said flat-out that under court precedent, the bulk of the aca would be likely to survive. and chief justice john roberts seemed to be a skeptic, too. here's roberts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "john roberts: i think it's hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act. i think, frankly, that they wanted the court to do that, but that's not our job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "johnson: so, noel, this could just be a matter of simple math. if kavanaugh and roberts join the court's three liberals, the bulk of the law would survive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: ok. but did the newest justice, amy coney barrett, offer any indication of what she's thinking on this one - because the aca kept coming up at her confirmation hearing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "johnson: it did. justice barrett asked several questions, mostly on the issue of standing, in essence, whether the red states and some individuals had actually suffered harm or an injury that would give them the right to sue in the first place. but amy coney barrett didn't really give a signal one way or another about how she might vote. remember; she told democrats last month she'd made no promises about the health care law and she wasn't hostile to it, even though she's written some critical things about the aca in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: it is notable, carrie, that this case was filed a couple of years ago, but it's being argued during a global pandemic. so the timing's super interesting. did that come up at all yesterday?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "johnson: you know, the u.s. house of representatives was there to defend the law. don verrilli, their lawyer, raised the issue of health care coverage. and here's what verrilli told the justices.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "johnson: what would happen is president-elect joe biden could work with congress early next year to try to impose some new financial penalty, maybe something small, like a dollar for not having insurance. biden has talked about wanting to make other, bigger changes to the health care system. republicans have been fighting the aca for 10 years now. if the court upholds this law in large part this year, that may be the end of the legal road for a while.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "king: so what is joe biden's top priority on education?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kamenetz: well, it's pretty basic. it's getting school doors open safely given the pandemic, and he's called that a national emergency. one recent estimate, noel, says just about 38% of children right now are in public school districts that are open five days a week. and so that raises a lot of worries about learning losses, social and emotional impacts, especially for young children and those with special needs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: yeah. i mean, it seems like just about everyone would like to be in school right now or would like to - would like their kids to be in school right now. but there's the pandemic. what can joe biden do about that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kamenetz: so one thing experts told me is that, regardless of any legislation or any significant funding getting passed, just more coordination at the federal level would help right away for schools to reopen and stay open, talking about things like tracking cases nationally and getting more coordinated safety guidance, for example. and it's interesting to note from some of the doctors that he's named to his covid safety task force, they've been really vocal about the need to open schools safely and with proper funding. so, for example, dr. zeke emanuel, who biden named to his task force, said in an op-ed, being safe is not free.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: they need funding, you said. what do they need funding for, and where would the money come from?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kamenetz: you know, i think the basic thing is social distancing, which means smaller class sizes, which means teachers and educators. the pandemic's recession has actually forced a lot of educators out of work at the worst possible time. one estimate, about a million educators have been laid off. so education groups have asked for $200 billion in emergency relief, which is a big number at least to be starting with. and if there ends up being a new coronavirus stimulus bill, it could be the biggest education package for - from the federal government in a really long time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: ok. so beyond legislation, because you've been talking to the transition team, what are some other areas of education policy that you think we should have an eye on?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kamenetz: well, the president-elect has pledged often and publicly to appoint an educator as the education secretary. and i talked to becky pringle, the president of the national education association, the nation's largest teacher union, about what that means.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "both goldstein and vladeck note, however, that the conservative majority has been cutting back on the regulatory power of administrative agencies to carry out objectives spelled out in legislation. that trend, they observe, is likely to increase, making it more difficult for agencies to make rules carrying out everything from environmental to consumer protection laws.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "german lopez: so the cdc report found that there were nearly 64,000 drug overdose deaths last year in the u.s., meaning in 2016. so to put that in context, that's more than gun deaths. that's more than car crashes. it's more than hiv/aids during the peak of that epidemic. another way of looking at it is it's more deaths in the u.s. from drug overdoses than there were u.s. casualties during the entire vietnam war. it's now the biggest drug overdose epidemic in u.s. history. there seems to be a slight increase so far in 2017 as well. so it just - it seems to just keep getting worse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so, you know, you've written in part about the hidden effects of the opioid epidemic and of all the overdoses that we've been seeing. you've written about, like, morgues that have run out of room and children who have been orphaned. tell us one of the stories that you found related to these kind of hidden effects.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: yeah. so i think the most striking story along these lines last year that i found was this morgue that - they'd run out of room. and what they ended up having to do is rent out extra space in these trailers, i think it was, to hold the bodies - the extra bodies that they were getting from drug overdose deaths. and this is something that we need to look at in terms of the overdose crisis. it's just - obviously, the amount of death is a tragedy on its own. but it's really having these rippling effects through society.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another example that you mentioned there is these kids who have been orphaned as a result of their parents overdosing or their parents becoming addicted and therefore not being able to take care of the kids anymore. and it - that will forever transform these kids' lives. they're no longer going to be able to rely on their parents. they'll have to move in with their grandparents. there are many quotes by now in newspapers all over the country of grandparents saying, i didn't think i'd be taking care of kids again at this age. and part of that is because, well, they might not want to. and that'll affect the grandparents as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you see this ripple effect here in terms of, it's now causing all these financial costs for, say, these morgues. it's changing the lives of these children. it's changing retirement plans for these grandparents, and on and on. and that's really one of the things that i think is most pronounced about addiction is that it's not just a disease that kills people. it is definitely that, and that's obviously an awful part about it. but it's also a disease that starts really - it really becomes an epidemic, as it's called, because it affects all aspects of people's lives and not just their own lives but other people's lives as well and really becomes this public health issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so this is a crisis that's spread way beyond people who started on opioids as a medical way of treating chronic pain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: right. i mean, that's usually pinned as the initial catalyst for the crisis - is doctors overprescribing these drugs. and to be clear here, the problem isn't just that pain patients who got the painkillers got the drugs and started getting addicted to them and started overdosing. it's also that because they had so many excess pills, it was also easy for, say, their kids to go to their parents' medicine cabinets and take an extra stash of opioids and use them illicitly or sell them or whatever. so that really led to the proliferation of these painkillers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but over time as we've - what we've seen is that there is this transition to heroin and fentanyl. and a lot of that is just because heroin and fentanyl are far cheaper in the illicit market than painkillers. some of that is also just these people - some of the people who were addicted to painkillers, they've now lost access to painkillers either because they lost their prescriptions or they just became expensive. and that has led people who are addicted to opioids to resort to fentanyl and heroin. and this is one way to avoid withdrawal symptoms or keep getting high or whatever it is that they're using the opioids for. and that has also caused the drug overdose deaths to spike.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: i think one of the ways that policies have tried to crack down on the opioid epidemic is to restrict, to regulate the number of prescriptions that a doctor can write for a patient for opioids. am i right about that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: so in general, it's not that the government is setting a specific quota or number for individual doctors. the dea sets a quota for opioid painkillers overall in terms of how many companies can manufacture and produce and sell. but individual doctors - they're being told to just watch their prescriptions. and they've also been given these guidelines.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so one example is doctors are being told, with some exceptions, try to avoid prescribing opioids for chronic pain. and that's because we've seen in the science that opioids aren't even good for treating chronic pain in the first place because of the way people become tolerant to the drugs. and because over time, if you take opioids, you can actually become more sensitive to pain. so in some ways, opioids can make you actually feel that pain more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it seems to me the general sense is that doctors are now supposed to be thinking of this not as a first-line treatment but sort of as a limited way to address pain in certain situations instead of the way they were approaching it before, which was, hey, this is a first-line treatment for all sorts of pain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so what impact has that had on people who were using opioids for chronic pain and were already addicted?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: if a patient is cut off from opioids - first of all, it's, at the very least, very, very unpleasant to be immediately cut off from your entire supply of opioids because that'll cause withdrawal. and withdrawal is - it's really - just imagine the worst stomach bug imaginable, and then compound that with crippling anxiety. it's really terrible to go through. so people will go through great strides to avoid that, and that's why some people will start buying opioid painkillers in the illicit market or they might start resorting to heroin and possibly fentanyl as a result.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's why, in general, one thing that experts have told me is that if you are going to reduce the amount of painkillers somebody is taking, you want to taper them off, so slowly reduce their dose over time. but also, you want to talk with this patient and see, are they stable on opioids? are they actually misusing the drugs? is there evidence that they're putting themselves at risk? and these are, like, some of the things that doctors should consider when beginning to taper them off these drugs because otherwise, there is this risk that they'll start resorting to the illicit market, and that can heighten their chances of overdose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what is fentanyl, and why is it so dangerous?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: so fentanyl is this synthetic opioid, and it was originally produced for treating very intense pain. the common treatment that it was used for was cancer pain. so we're talking about patients who - many of them were terminally ill. and the risk of addiction when you're terminally ill is obviously much lower because you're thinking, well, we want to give this patient some sense of pain relief in their last few weeks, months, years of life. and that's how fentanyl was commonly advertised. it's, hey, this is a really potent opioid, and we should be giving it to these really terminally ill patients.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but over time, it turns out that it's actually pretty - relatively easy to produce in a lab. and that has led to its production in places like china, where it's now shipped through mexico, through canada, into the u.s. and the biggest risk here is that very often, fentanyl is sold as heroin. so if you're somebody who uses heroin, you think, ok, i'm going to take the dose i've always taken on this drug. but then it turns out you're taking fentanyl, which is multiple times as potent as heroin. and because you don't know that you're actually taking a higher dose - you can't see it based on what you are doing - it increases your chances of overdose without you even knowing it. and that's really what the risk has been, is that as fentanyl has increasingly been sold as heroin or increasingly laced into heroin, the chances of overdose have spiked dramatically. and that's one of the reasons we've seen this rise in deaths.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: why is it being sold as heroin or being laced in heroin?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: so the common theory here is that it's just cheaper than heroin. so because it's cheaper than heroin, that makes it - there's a financial incentive there for drug traffickers, drug dealers to essentially cut their drug. so the idea is, well, if you put your fentanyl into heroin, you can put a little more kick into that heroin without actually paying for better-quality heroin. and that means that you can simply sell a stronger product for a lower price or you can sell it for the same price and just make more money in the end.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so why is fentanyl cheaper than heroin?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: the simple reason seems to be that it is easy to produce in a lab compared to heroin. so heroin requires getting an opium poppy and then converting that into actual heroin. fentanyl can just be produced synthetically in a lab. so it's kind of like - i've heard this comparison before of comparing it sort of to producing meth, which is also relatively cheap and easy to make. it's not quite as easy to produce as meth, but that gives you the same general idea of just how easy this is to make in a lab. so that's really the big reason. it's just simply much more easy to produce.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: sure, so you don't have to rely on poppy-producing countries like you do for heroin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so a lot of the fentanyl in the u.s. comes from china. why is it coming from china?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: apparently the biggest reason there is just, they have the most lax regulations for these kinds of labs, so that has let a lot of this illegal drug trade really just take off there. china is now taking some steps, supposedly, working with the u.s. to crack down on that. we still have to see how well that works out because china has kind of struggled to crack down on these labs before because there are just so many of them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there's also a question of well, ok, if china does this, will these labs just move to another place that's loosely regulated, such as india? and then the fentanyl production might take off there. so we're still seeing how that will shake out. but that's generally the reason, is just - it's very loosely regulated there. and the laws that do exist are very loosely enforced.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is german lopez. he's a senior reporter for vox and has been covering the opioid epidemic. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(soundbite of rhythm future quartet's iberian sunrise)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. and we're talking about the opioid epidemic. and we're also talking about the medical model - the public health model - for dealing with it as opposed to the punitive model. my guest is german lopez. he's a senior reporter for vox who focuses on drugs, guns, criminal justice, race and lgbtq issues. he's been reporting on drug policy issues since 2010.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so one way of dealing with drug epidemics is punishment. you know, you put people in prison, and maybe you put them in prison for a really long time. there're some really bad effects when that happens. so you've been looking into alternatives to prison and into places that are creating alternatives to the punitive model of addiction. and one of the things you write is that we have to stop seeing addiction as a moral failure and think of it as a real medical problem. describe those two conflicting points of view.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: for a long time in america, we have criminalized drug use. we have seen it as kind of this moral failure. i mean, whenever i write about the opioid epidemic, i get emails to this - that basically voice this argument all the time that - i mean, some of these emails are really awful, saying that, like, these people should be allowed to suffer and die because it's their fault that they're in the mess they're in. and the problem with that is there's just no evidence that that's a good way to deal with addiction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and increasingly, if you talk to experts, if you talk to addiction specialists, they will tell you that this is a chronic, relapsing disease. and what they mean by that is that this is a disease that will need a lot of medical care over time, and that's how you properly treat it. the problem with the criminal justice approach is that when you put people in these prisons for their drug use, you're shutting them off from their communities, you're shutting them off from their families. you might be cutting them off from care because sometimes prisons are very poorly equipped to deal with drug addiction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if you think about what causes drug addiction, a lot of that simply works against this person going into recovery. so one thing that causes drug addiction is simply a lack of access to treatment. so if a prison doesn't have that, obviously, that's going to cause the addiction to get worse. but the other is just a general sense of despair. there are many studies out there linking addiction with other mental health issues and also linking addiction to just a general sense of existential despair.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so when you're cutting somebody off from their families and their communities, you're isolating them, you're making them feel worse about their lives. and if you're in that position, some people might become more motivated to quit drug use, but a lot of people will simply become worse as a result of that. they're going to be less happy, and that might give them more reason to use drugs because it might be their escape. and that's really the major way i view this criminal justice approach as not being a good idea. when you put people in prison for these drugs, you're cutting them off from the things that will, over time, probably help them get better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so you've looked into various approaches for harm reduction. would you explain what harm reduction is?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: harm reduction is this idea that a lot of people are going to use drugs, no matter how much treatment is available, no matter what you do to prevent drug use in the first place. so if you want to avoid people getting addicted and dying from drugs, one way to do that is just mitigating the risks of these drugs. so a popular - and, really in the research, uncontroversial in terms of the evidence behind it - is these clean needle exchanges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what these places do is essentially give people who want to get these needles - they can go to the - these stations. they obtain new needles, new syringes. and then they can use those for whatever drug it is that they're using. and the idea is - yeah. to some degree that means that they now have a source for these syringes. but it also means that these syringes are clean in that they aren't contaminated by, say, hiv or hepatitis, which can also obviously cause death by themselves. so that's one way of harm reduction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the common criticism of harm reduction is that there is this fear that it will lead to more drug use because they're thinking that if you mitigate the risks of drugs, then people will feel less threatened by drugs and therefore be more willing to use them. but again, there has been a lot of research into this through needle exchanges. and they have found time and time again that there does not seem to be this increase in drug use. what does happen when you make these needle exchanges available is there's lower incidence of hiv, lower incidence of hepatitis. and, therefore, there's less death overall caused by drugs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so in your attempt to visit places that are using harm reduction approaches to dealing with the opioid epidemic, you visited a clinic in vancouver that deals with prescription heroin. i didn't know this kind of treatment existed. would you describe this prescription heroin treatment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: yeah. when i first approached the story, i was pretty surprised by just what i was finding here. so essentially, the thinking is there is now so much fentanyl out there in the illicit market that drug users don't know what they're going to get. and the thinking is, well, at least if you provide them with prescription heroin, you'll, one, be able to ensure that they get a relatively clean supply of the drug - meaning it won't be laced with fentanyl or something else that will increase the chances of overdose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing is that you'll be able to supervise them as they're using or injecting the drug. and that will let you respond in case they overdose to ensure that they get medical help immediately. they'll get the opiate overdose antidote naloxone, which helps revive people from overdoses. or they'll give them an oxygen tank which can help with respiratory problems that come from overdose. so that's kind of why it's phrased as harm reduction because you don't want - i mean, obviously, in an ideal world, you don't want people using heroin. but if people are going to use heroin anyway, here's one way that you can provide it and at least mitigate some of the risks that could lead people to die from it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: i'm sure a lot of people listening to this are just thinking the people who administer prescription heroin are just enabling heroin addicts, are just enabling a horrible addiction with a horrible drug instead of helping them get off the drug.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: right. and quite frankly, when i first started looking into this, i was deeply skeptical of it. but then i started talking to experts and looking into some of the research about this. and one thing to be clear about is this is not going to be for everyone who uses heroin. the way that this is administered in vancouver is that after someone has gone through other treatment avenues - so say medications - other medications for opioid addiction or other traditional treatments that we think of in the u.s. - once somebody has gone through that, then prescription heroin will be made available to them. ultimately, they estimate about 10 to 15 percent of people addicted to opioids will end up needing to use this. and the other thing is that with the research - when you actually look at this, it does seem to lead to better outcomes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: my guest is german lopez, a reporter for vox who covers the opioid epidemic. we'll continue the conversation after a break. and we'll talk with bobby allyn, a reporter at whyy in philadelphia about how some public health advocates and philadelphia city officials are trying to make their city the first in the u.s. to have a legally sanctioned safe injection site, which just to be clear, is not the same as offering prescription heroin. i'm terry gross. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross back with german lopez, a senior reporter for vox who's been covering the opioid epidemic. when we left off, we were talking about one of the approaches to harm reduction practiced at a clinic in vancouver. they selectively offer prescription heroin to users who have had no success with any approach to getting them off the drug, including rehab.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you spoke with people who were using prescription heroin in vancouver. tell us one of the stories you heard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: so i think the biggest example of this is john pinkney (ph). he's one of the people i talked to at vancouver. he actually passed away last year due to unrelated health issues. but his story was really inspiring to some degree. this was someone who has struggled with illicit drug use for decades. he linked the beginning of his drug using to his teens. he had a horrible family situation. his parents were abusive. he was homeless for some time and on and on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, really, this guy went through some horrible, horrible things throughout his life. and he used illicit drugs for a decade. then he found this prescription heroin clinic. and the way he put it to me is that he felt he had finally gotten his life back because he felt that now he can maintain a job. he was a security guard. now he had a stable housing situation. so he had an apartment. i mean, he bragged to me about having furniture and a tv in his house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and these are some of the things that, like, a lot of us would take for granted. but for somebody who had been struggling with drug use all his life, this was a really monumental step for him. seeing how this man, after decades of drug use, managed to turn his life around - it really showed to me that, at least for some people, this really can work. this was someone who really had become a productive member of society as a result.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, how did prescription heroin help him become productive? because i think the common image of a heroin addict is somebody who's basically, you know, sitting on the floor, nodding...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: ...and not working and not doing much of anything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: the thing you need to understand, i think, about heroin use is at a certain point, heroin use becomes more - and this is a term commonly used by people who are addicted - it becomes more about getting straight than getting high. and what they mean by that is that heroin no longer makes them feel this sense of euphoria or whatever that we commonly attach to it. it makes them feel normal. and that's due to just how it works in the brain and how you become tolerant to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you do everything you can to avoid withdrawal. and that's really what drug addiction becomes over time - is you really want to avoid this sense of withdrawal. and because of that, when you imagine somebody who is, say, stealing to obtain heroin, it's not just that they want to get high from this drug. for a lot of them, it's that they want to avoid this sickness that comes from dependence to this drug. so when they have a reliable source of heroin, they can go to this clinic and get it two or three times a day. suddenly, they don't have to worry about how they're going to get their fix that day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they're going to start thinking about the other things they can do because they know that they will have a reliable supply of this drug. and, you know, it's not going to be something that everybody feels easy with. the people and staff at the clinic that i talked to - they were - to some degree, they seemed uneasy with it. i mean, they were confident in that they think they're saving lives by doing this. but it's - nobody wants people using heroin. like i said, in an ideal world, that wouldn't be the case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this seems to enable them to focus on the other aspects of their lives instead of just focusing on how they're going to get their next supply of the drug. and at least in this clinic, they have had zero people under their care overdose and die, which is remarkable. they have a few hundred patients. and they've been seeing them for years. so that's a really remarkable outcome compared to - if you were having a few hundred people using heroin in the street, you would expect at least some of them to die.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so we've been talking about approaches to harm reduction. you were describing the prescription heroin approach that's being tried in some countries, including parts of canada. that is not a legal approach in the u.s. but you said when you went looking for a state in the u.s. that's taking the opioid epidemic seriously and using a medical model instead of a punitive model, you went to vermont. what did you find there?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: yeah. so vermont has really over the past few years built up what they call a hub-and-spoke system. and it's a fancy term for what they've essentially done - is really integrated addiction treatment into the rest of the health care system. so the hub is the place where you would get intensive care. i like to think of this kind of as this emergency-room-like situation where you go in, and you'll be able to sign up, and you'll get really intensive daily care for your opioid addiction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then the spoke is where you go after you sort of stabilize and get better over time. and this is a place where you'll get treatment, say, on a weekly, monthly - some people bi-monthly basis - over time, you'll need to see it less and less. but the key thing that vermont did with this is they emphasize this as a public health issue. first of all, they leveraged a medicaid waiver for this to pay for it, to set up these clinics. and then they've really leveraged other aspects of health insurance expansion under the affordable care act, including the medicaid expansion, to make sure that patients have insurance to pay for all this treatment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and through this, they've provided these medications for opioid addiction. so some of these medications are suboxone. that's the brand name for buprenorphine. and then there's methadone. and the idea with these medications is that they stave off withdrawal symptoms without causing patients to get high. and that way, people can focus on improving other aspects of their life that might have led them to drug use in the first place. and so they won't have to worry about withdrawal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's really what vermont has hunkered down on - is really providing this treatment, which is considered the gold standard for opiate addiction care, and making sure that patients have access to it. and the idea is anyone should be able to go to a hub or spoke and get treatment really quickly - within a few days - because one of the risks is if you have these waiting periods, as some states do, of weeks or months for care, then people are going to keep using drugs. and with each time that they use drugs, they're going to be at risk for overdose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so it is the use of methadone or buprenorphine controversial?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: if you talk to addiction specialists and experts about this, it is not controversial. it is widely considered the gold standard of care. there's research that shows if you get people who are addicted to opioids on these medications, their chances of death will drop by more than 50 percent, which is a really remarkable outcome in terms of health.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but in much of the public discussion, these drugs have been maligned and stigmatized. one common frame that people tend to view this as is that it's replacing one drug with another because you're giving up, say, heroin or opioid painkillers and simply replacing that with another opioid like buprenorphine or methadone. in fact, our former secretary of health and human services, tom price - he actually made an argument like this last year. but experts caution that this is not how you're supposed to view these medications because the problem with addiction is not that somebody is using drugs - i mean, i'm sure a lot of people listening to this show will have had a cup of coffee this morning. that has caffeine, which is a drug. i'm sure a lot of people will have had a few drinks maybe last night or over the weekend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they'll think, you know, i'm fine with that. and that's generally what you want to think. it's like, the problem is not the drug use, per se. the problem was when that drug use leads somebody to do things that aren't good for society or themselves - say, they might be stealing. they might be putting themselves at risk of overdose. and what these drugs enable is that they make it possible to not have to worry about withdrawal. they make it so you get a clean source of these medications, so you do not have to worry about overdose. and in that way, you can get your life back in order. and while you still are technically using opioids, you're doing it in a much more stabilized environment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "when candidate donald trump was running, he promised to address the opioid epidemic and, you know, presented the message that he knew how to do it. what has he done?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: so the biggest thing he's done, and really, the only notable thing he's done so far, is he declared a public health emergency. this is a very limited change in that it might unlock some extra resources, although it's unclear how many, to deal with opiate addiction. experts are deeply skeptical about this because it seems to be just so limited. so one of the funds that this unlocks only has around $50,000 in it, which is simply not enough to deal with an opioid epidemic of this scale. and otherwise, it's not clear what else this declaration will do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the other things he's done are, for the most part, just investigating this issue more thoroughly. so he appointed an opioid commission led by new jersey governor chris christie to look into this issue, and they made a bunch of recommendations. and he's also had one of his chief advisers, kellyanne conway, lead what they call an opioid cabinet into this issue. but so far, there's been a lot of investigation, but it's not really clear if any specific action is being taken. it seems to be a lot of talk but not nearly as much action to accompany that talk.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so trump has said he would do what he can to end the opioid epidemic. at the same time, he's pledged to end obamacare. what has obamacare contributed to the treatment of addiction?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: the basic way to understand this is that obamacare dramatically expanded access to health insurance in the u.s. it also enforced some laws requiring that insurers treat addiction treatment as well as they do, say, physical treatment or surgery. these are called parity laws. they basically require that insurers treat addiction treatment just as seriously as they would treat any other illness. so those are the two ways that obamacare has really had an impact here. it's dramatically expanded access to health insurance, which lets people pay for addiction treatment, and then it's also made sure that this health insurance will have to cover addiction treatment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so going back to vermont, they really leveraged the affordable care act by, one, getting a waiver through the law that let them set up clinics and hubs and spokes. and two, just the fact that more people within the state now have federally funded health insurance has allowed the state to pay for these programs that they otherwise would not have been able to afford before. and through those two avenues, it has really let vermont build up this hub-and-spoke system, which is what's let it essentially expand treatment to - for addiction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so since you've been writing about addiction-related issues since 2010, i'm wondering if addiction has hit you close to home, if people who you are close to have been - have become addicts, if you've seen it firsthand in that way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lopez: yeah, so i'm from ohio, which is now the state with the second highest drug overdose death rate in the country, so i've definitely seen this firsthand in my family and friends. i still have friends from high school that have been struggling with addiction. i have family that has struggled with addiction. so i've seen this firsthand. and i had a friend overdose on drugs a couple of years ago, and that's one of the things that led me to start looking at this issue much more seriously. and i think if you live in some of these states that have been really hard hit, it's almost inescapable how much damage this does.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think people will see the drug overdose statistics, and they'll see some of that. but what's really shocked me about this is just how addiction is all-consuming in people's lives. so i've had friends who ended up not being able to finish school, whether that's high school or college, because of their addiction. that'll forever change their lives. i've had friends who just ended up homeless or ended up not being able to chase the career that they wanted all their lives. and when i see the impact that this has had personally on my communities, it just - it has, of course, moved me to cover this issue more seriously.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. although in several countries, people addicted to opioids can go to legally sanctioned, medically supervised safe injection sites, there are no such legal facilities in the u.s. many public health experts in philadelphia would like to make their city the first. last week, whyy reporter bobby allyn broke the story that now some top city officials are actively pursuing the idea. and the controversy it's generating in philly exemplifies some of the obstacles to creating such a site in america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allyn: so how a safe injection site typically works is, someone will come from off the streets into this facility, and they will bring their own drugs. if the user wants, the drugs can be tested for fentanyl, that very potent synthetic. and it's done very quickly. they have these fentanyl test strips, and they could do it almost instantly and know whether or not there's any fentanyl in that dosage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "medical staff are sort of waiting, watching, supervising and providing clean, sterilized equipment. so they're providing, you know, all the things you need to do heroin. there's this thing called a cooker. they're given needles. they're given clean swabs. and this way, the people who are using won't contract infectious diseases like hepatitis c or hiv. and nurses are standing by watching people essentially shoot up with oxygen and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone. and when they're done, they go into what's known as this chill area. and there, their breathing is monitored, and other vital signs are monitored. and from that point, they're kind of released back onto the streets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, during this process, if they want, they can be directed toward detox and other drug treatment programs. and that's been a big selling point for the advocates, the so-called harm reductionists who are very much in support of these safe injection sites. they say they can be a bridge to treatment services for people who wouldn't necessarily find it on their own. and that's why advocates don't like to call these sites safe injection sites but comprehensive user engagement sites. that sort of speaks to how people come there, they come to use, but, hopefully, it's a way to turn their life around.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what's the status of this now in philadelphia?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "allyn: so mayor jim kenney of philadelphia is in support of safe injection sites. he made a new position in philadelphia city hall known as a harm reductionist. he started this task force with dozens and dozens of experts that issued a number of recommendations about how to combat the opioid crisis.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allyn: absolutely. and so that's why the stage of this in philadelphia requires the buy-in from local law enforcement. before this is going to become official, the department head, the police commissioner in philadelphia and the, you know, 6,000-plus rank-and-file police officers have to agree that this is something that the community needs. and that's going to be an uphill battle.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allyn: it's an interesting question. in vermont, some lawmakers are proposing a similar safe injection site. and the response from federal law enforcement has been, if you do open a safe injection site, we will muster all of the resources of the federal government to come after you. the u.s. attorney in vermont released this very unambiguous statement saying this. there are federal crimes that will happen here. we will seize your assets, and we will make arrests not just of the supervisors but even the workers in the safe injection site. so that is kind of setting the stage for what will likely be a really intense standoff between - even if local police agree - between local officials and the federal government.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "they're sick of seeing the piles of syringes. everyone in the community knows that stakeholders, that elected officials have to do something. but the idea of a safe injection site is just not - there's no clear consensus on that yet. and it's because it's very visceral. when you think about a bunch of people who are often chronic drug users congregating to one place and coming in and out and maybe interacting with you as you're on your way home from the grocery store, interacting with your children or interacting with you as you're walking your dog - i mean, a lot of these are fears that are based in the perception that people who are using opioids are dangerous people who may hurt you and your family.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "richards: well, i mean, that's not - this is not what that rule says. the rule basically says if any employee or objects to birth control, they don't have to provide it. and look. i think the problem is - you look who's been in charge of health and human services with the trump administration. it has been filled with key positions, folks who have been against birth control from the very beginning. in fact, ironically, the woman who was appointed to run the national family planning program has said herself she doesn't believe in birth control. this is just the beginning. and i think many of us expect this will not end here. there are rumors of all kinds of other ways in which they're going to restrict birth control access. and i just don't understand it. it's good for women's health. it's good for the economy. and this kind of attack is something that you would have expected in the 1930s, not in 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: and we just have a few seconds left. but i mean, the obama administration issued this mandate to cover birth control. religious organizations filed suit. the supreme court ruled that the government can't force private companies, nonprofits to pay for birth control against their religious beliefs. are you concerned that the law is on the administration's side here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "richards: well, i mean, obviously we'll be challenging it along with the aclu, and that's really important. but there were all kinds of accommodations made for a religious employer. the danger is you have things now like universities that provide birth control for women that are students. you have all kinds of organizations who may have their own political or religious views. why should they be able to impose that on american women? it's simply not right. and we'll be fighting it every step of the way and ensuring that women continue to get birth control at planned parenthood.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here's an explanation of what npr is referring to when the word is used, and thoughts on some more precise language.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "webster's new world college dictionary, fifth edition (npr's dictionary of record) defines apprehend as to take into custody; capture or arrest. that's what i think an average listener or reader would understand when reading that, say, the number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade. the capture part of the dictionary definition conjures up an element of someone trying to escape, to run away. but increasingly, that's not what's happening at the border. nor does the 103,000-plus number actually reflect only apprehensions; it also includes what the government describes as inadmissibles (see below).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to npr's reporting team covering the issue, many migrants are crossing the border somewhere other than an official entry point and then presenting themselves, often in large family groups, to border agents and requesting asylum (though the percentage of the total requesting asylum is not included in the monthly report). is it accurate, then, to describe these people as having been apprehended, a word that also implies attempting to evade the law?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "a much smaller number of migrants are presenting themselves at official points of entry and requesting asylum. those migrants are included in the totals, but as inadmissibles. for the month of march, the figures were 92,607 apprehensions and 10,885 inadmissibles. the total is the 103,000-plus number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm not sure that most listeners and readers would hear apprehended and realize what a vast range of actions that encompasses. while shorthand is always tempting to journalists trying to describe the big picture and get to the meat of policy questions, more precision in this case would help npr's audience better understand the complicated border dynamics.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "laura smitherman, an npr deputy national editor who has been overseeing the border coverage, suggested unauthorized border crossings. and mark memmott, npr's standards and practices editor, suggested that, maybe 'detained' is often best because if you are apprehended or you surrender you're going to be detained for at least a while.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "- the debate is still about illegal immigration and what to do about it. illegal immigration remains an acceptable term when we're reporting about the issue. - when we're reporting about the people at the center of this story, it's still best practice to begin with action words, rather than labels. two examples: they are in the country illegally or have entered the country illegally. - in subsequent references, we now think it's ok to mix in the phrases undocumented immigrants and unauthorized immigrants. they are now in common usage. and, unlike the label illegal immigrants, they are not phrases sometimes used to hurt others. (our approach on this language is similar to what we've said about the debate over health care — it is best practice to first refer to the law republicans want to replace as the affordable care act. then it's ok to say obamacare.) - undocumented is also ok in headlines.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the word illegal always sparks email from listeners. under both u.s. and international law, migrants who ask for asylum at a port of entry are not committing an illegal act. as the u.s. citizenship and immigration services website notes, you may apply for asylum regardless of your immigration status, whether you are here legally or illegally. but the act of crossing the border without papers, even if the intent is to ask for asylum, is illegal. those are two different acts, which are often conflated.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "though roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called dreamers from deportation by the trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. but with ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that's because ginsburg's death gives republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by president trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. and that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the obamacare case and many others.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "alison kodjak, byline: senate democrats are almost certain to use their filibuster power to block a repeal of the affordable care act, so republicans may have to invoke special budget rules that can circumvent the democrats' opposition and defund the law. that would kill the parts of the aca that republicans hate most, like the requirement that everybody buy health insurance, but it could also leave many people who have coverage today without any coverage in the future.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "brooks: well, you know, i don't know if there's a there there. never underestimate the possibility for washington people to have pointless meetings. and it could be jeff sessions had a pointless meeting with cislyak (ph) the russian ambassador - or kislyak. and it could've just been one of those get-togethers that happens all the time. on the other hand, there are so many points of contact between trump - various trump persona and the russians that it's like a seurat painting - the points are beginning to look like something.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dionne: i can't resist. the, you know - and so that's striking. but i think the problem the trump people have is they cannot talk straight about russia. if jeff sessions had had a couple of meetings with the ambassador and hadn't gone out of his way to tell al franken on the committee in response to a question that didn't even ask him whether he had had any meetings that in fact he had had no meetings, this wouldn't be nearly as big a story.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "brooks: yeah, i thought it was interesting because you got to see trumpism the thing without trump the clownish behavior. so it was like a straight-on view - our first sort of straight-on view. what struck me first was how un-republican it was. the republican party has had three big units, all of whom were repudiated by the speech. social conservatives got nary a mention. fiscal hawks - he's spending a lot of money. foreign policy hawks - he does not believe in a lot of our alliances. but what he believes in is a strong government. he's - it's for a lot of big government. but it's very forceful father figure, very rough government against their enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the way i put it in the - one of my columns today was that he's privatized compassion and nationalized intimidation. and what i mean by that is all the compassionate realms of government that help people in trouble - he's cutting them. all that tough - he got tough-man type parts of government - he's spending a lot more money on. so we're going to get a lot stronger government but maybe a little rougher one.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dionne: yeah, i shuddered at the thought of trump as a father figure wondering, what kind of father is that with this roughness? i thought this was the old vinegar in a new bottle. he got a lot of credit he didn't deserve just because he showed he could spend one disciplined hour in relationship - in a relationship with the teleprompter, that what he was trying to do here is continue to scare the daylights out of the country to justify strong leadership and aggrandizing power. he talks about wide-open borders, gang members, drug dealers, criminals. we cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "liasson: well, it's turned out to be a base election. certainly, the president believes in that. the president is always all about his base. he tends to operate with a kind of social media or cable news business model, which is he doesn't really worry much about expanding his audience. he just wants them to watch the show more hours a day.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but trump believes - and there's a lot of evidence to show that he's right - that emotional issues - culture war issues, race, crime, immigration - work better at energizing voters than economic issues. and i think you see that with all these farmers who are being hurt by trump's policies in their pocketbook. but in their heart, they agree with him on these other issues. and they're sticking with them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i went back to my surgeon a week later in order to get the drains [which channel fluid from the surgical site] removed. he removed the drains, and reflexively, i reached up to feel the place where the lump had been in my chest. i just wanted to make sure it was gone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i reach up, and my fingers land on the lump. i have no breasts, and yet i have the lump in the same exact spot where it was before my surgery. and i look at my surgeon and i say, there's a lump here, and i'm feeling it. this is not ok.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he looks at me and says oh, i'm sure it's nothing, don't worry about it. i was like, i'm worried about it right now, and i need you to feel it. i'm not leaving your office today with a lump in the same exact spot as [where] my cancer was. he acted like, what a pain in the ass you are right now, and this is supposed to be your happy cancer-free moment and you're ruining it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the surgeon agreed to send me downstairs for a mammogram and things unfolded from there to show that it was indeed the same exact lump — that he had missed it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what did this experience teach you about the power dynamic in the relationship between doctors and patients?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it kind of reaffirmed in some ways what i've been feeling all along. when you're the patient and you're sitting there in a paper towel, essentially, and you're speaking with a surgeon, the power imbalance is very stark. no matter who you are. i think as a woman speaking to a male surgeon, the power imbalance is greater because of our cultural attitudes toward gender. then to have the surgeon be dismissive, and kind of wave off my concern as like, oh you're just getting hysterical.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's also a long history of women being treated dismissively by the medical establishment. and it's one thing to know that happens as a feminist and as a woman who writes about these issues, but it's another thing to physically live that experience and to stand up for yourself. it drove me to write the book, and it inspires me to talk publicly to patients and doctors about these issues.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "how did you make the decision to go flat, to not get reconstructive surgery? was it hard to make that choice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's always absolutely hard to make a choice to amputate part of your body. when i first found the lump, i thought, ok, i'll probably get a lumpectomy and radiation. as a health reporter, i knew that was my least invasive option, and it had a really good track record. because my lump was high on my breast and my breast was small, [i wasn't] a candidate for lumpectomy. [my surgeon] said it would decimate my breast, there would be nothing left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he immediately switched gears and he said, don't worry. here's what we're going to do: we're going to give you a single mastectomy, and we're going to reconstruct your breasts by severing the largest muscle in your back, cutting a flap out of that muscle, leaving one end of the flap connected to the blood supply in your back, and then wrapping the other end of the flap under your arm until it reaches the front of your body. and then we're going to put a breast implant in the cavity where we just took out all the breast tissue, and then lay this muscle over the breast implant, and that's going to be your new breast.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wow. that sounds invasive. how did you wrap your head around that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i was flabbergasted. i looked at him and asked, isn't that muscle doing something? he was just waved his hand like, oh, most women never miss it. and i thought to myself, ha, that's hard to imagine because this is the largest muscle in the back. in that moment, i knew i would miss it. i'm a very active person, i was only 38 at the time, i was a yoga teacher.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so this idea that we don't need our body strength, that we don't need to be strong because what's more important than strength is presenting to the world as having breasts, is really disturbing to me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it was assumed that i would much rather look quote-unquote normal in clothes, that that would be my priority over feeling strong and confident in my body. so the only people this rebuilt breast would be for would be strangers. and that's who i was going to sacrifice my strength for, so it quickly made no sense to me to go that route.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and once you made that decision, did your doctors support you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i was lucky in that my surgeon accepted that choice. i did not get a lot of pushback from the surgeon. i think the hurdle for me and for a lot of women is that the choice to go flat was not presented to me. i had to come up with that idea on my own. when i went home from the conversation with the plastic surgeon, my mind was reeling, and i was thinking, like, how can i escape the options that he put in front of me? i'm a big advocate for surgeons putting flat on the menu of options that they offer to women from the get-go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you've been outspoken about the fact that some women are not having their wish to go flat respected by their doctors. how does that happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "recently, maybe a year or two ago, it came to my attention that women were asking their surgeons to make them flat, and during the surgery, the surgeon would change their minds. while the woman was under anesthesia, the surgeon would decide for him or herself, i'm going to leave a little extra skin in case this woman changes her mind. so breast cancer patients are waking up from surgery with excess skin left on their chest after having asked to be made flat. the skin sags and droops — for many women it is like having two empty pillowcases on your chest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is discussed all the time in online forums. i talked to eight women it happened to while reporting another story. that this happens on a regular basis is an abomination, it's a violation. and it just says so much about the culture of paternalism and protectionism that certainly exists in the medical system today, and especially among surgeons. ultimately, they don't trust women to make good decisions about their bodies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when this happens, do women typically go back for additional surgery?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's no small thing to have to go back for another surgery. and most insurance companies fight paying for a revision. the average breast reconstruction takes several surgeries, and they pay for that no problem. but if the surgeon messes up your mastectomy and leaves extra skin, and you go back and ask for revision, those women are told that's cosmetic surgery and it's not covered.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so are more women going flat these days?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no evidence that the trend is reversing per se. actually, the number of women who get reconstruction has been going up pretty steadily for lots of reasons, including obamacare, [which] allowed a lot more women to have insurance coverage. i always say i'm not anti-reconstruction; i'm pro-information. i just want people to have good information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what's interesting is that what's happening with flat visibility, especially in the media, is you see more of it. there's amazing stuff happening. people like tig notaro being flat and taking her shirt off during a comedy routine – that was a really big move.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm not sure everyone appreciates this comparison, but because i'm queer, i compare it to coming out of the closet. more and more women are seeing flat visibility represented in the media. and i think what it's doing is it's allowing women to feel brave. they feel like, oh wow, look at what she's doing. she's out there, she's flat, she's bold.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i have been a member of the united states senate for thirty years. i had another long, if not as long, career before i arrived here, another profession that was profoundly rewarding, and in which i had experiences and friendships that i revere. but make no mistake, my service here is the most important job i have had in my life. and i am so grateful to the people of arizona for the privilege – for the honor – of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country i love.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've known and admired men and women in the senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of american politics. they came from both parties, and from various backgrounds. their ambitions were frequently in conflict. they held different views on the issues of the day. and they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively. our responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our republic. and our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all. the most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving america's problems and to defend her from her adversaries.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "our deliberations today – not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities – authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role – are often lively and interesting. they can be sincere and principled. but they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time i remember. our deliberations can still be important and useful, but i think we'd all agree they haven't been overburdened by greatness lately. and right now they aren't producing much for the american people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both sides have let this happen. let's leave the history of who shot first to the historians. i suspect they'll find we all conspired in our decline – either by deliberate actions or neglect. we've all played some role in it. certainly i have. sometimes, i've let my passion rule my reason. sometimes, i made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh i said to a colleague. sometimes, i wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "incremental progress, compromises that each side criticize but also accept, just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and keep our enemies from doing their worst isn't glamorous or exciting. it doesn't feel like a political triumph. but it's usually the most we can expect from our system of government, operating in a country as diverse and quarrelsome and free as ours.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "considering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic governments, and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem solving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, and the liberty and justice it preserves, is a magnificent achievement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "our system doesn't depend on our nobility. it accounts for our imperfections, and gives an order to our individual strivings that has helped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth. it is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than 'winning.' even when we must give a little to get a little. even when our efforts manage just three yards and a cloud of dust, while critics on both sides denounce us for timidity, for our failure to 'triumph.'", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? we're not getting much done apart. i don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. there's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the american people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate is capable of that. we know that. we've seen it before. i've seen it happen many times. and the times when i was involved even in a modest way with working out a bipartisan response to a national problem or threat are the proudest moments of my career, and by far the most satisfying.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this place is important. the work we do is important. our strange rules and seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and insist on our cooperation are important. our founders envisioned the senate as the more deliberative, careful body that operates at a greater distance than the other body from the public passions of the hour.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "shapiro: let's go back and talk about how democrats got into this deep hole in the first place. they lost a lot of ground during president obama's time in office, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: they did. democrats actually ended up suffering the most losses under any president since dwight eisenhower. so, you know, this started as a backlash to obamacare, for sure. but...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: right. but there was also criticism that democrats were just too complacent under obama and not worried about building winning coalitions at the state level. so this started in 2010 - the tea party, the republican wave. it was a really bad year for them to lose that much because that's the precursor to redistricting. so republicans then were able to shore up those gains for many cycles going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so for democratic governors - they actually hit their lowest point during obama's term as he was leaving. the 2016 elections left them outnumbered 2-1 - as you mentioned, just 16 democratic governors compared to 33 for republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: how fast have democrats been able to rebound now with trump as president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: they have been able to really make some pretty substantial gains in the past three years. they made huge gains in 2018. now, most of these governors are elected during a midterm year, and that put them from just 17 governors - then they went to 23 after the 2018 elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: those'll be the ones who are in office when redistricting happens after the 2020 census. and all of this - governors and then, of course, democrats flipped the house. we see now result of that happening with the impeachment hearings - was seen as a rebuke to trump and his presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then last month, democrats solidified and added to those gains. in kentucky, andy beshear defeated republican incumbent matt bevin in a state that trump carried by 30 points. now, bevin was uniquely unpopular and had made plenty of enemies, but trump was not able to save him despite multiple trips to the state. and democrats were able to capitalize there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then two weeks later, you had louisiana democratic governor john bel edwards, who had won in an upset in 2015, was seen as this sort of accidental governor. he held onto a seat in another state that trump carried by double digits, again showing that trump's campaigning has not been transferable down-ballot, particularly in governor's races.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: are there any big lessons here in how democrats can win in traditionally republican states like kentucky and louisiana?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: they campaigned, you know, on health care. it was a bad issue for them back in 2010, but now they really sort of see an upswing happening when it comes to preexisting conditions and the expansion of medicaid. so there is traditionally a difference in how states vote at a federal level than at a state level.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "voters tend to see governors as less partisan, and they're willing to vote for a democrat sometimes, even if they may vote for a republican at the presidential level or a republican senator. so, you know, we - the reverse is true, too. maryland, massachusetts, vermont are all heavily democratic states at the presidential level, but all three have republican governors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: now, you mentioned that 2010 was a tough year for democrats to lose so many seats because it's a redistricting year. redistricting happens every 10 years, which means 2020 is really important. how does it look for democrats next year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taylor: well, they've made those gains that they needed last cycle in 2018. and then 2020 - you know, they could sort of take back the majority among governors, too, in states that are really important. their best chances are pickups in new hampshire and in vermont, states that both went for hillary clinton in 2016. but they'll also be in defense in north carolina that's already in a redistricting mess right there, too, that's really important. new maps coming in montana. donald trump won both of those states, and republicans want to win them back.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in the senate, on the other hand, republicans have a very favorable landscape and are competing in conservative states held by democrats. the fundamentals favor the gop in these states, and if republicans win where they should win, they will hold the senate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allyn: yeah. so parties were racing towards an agreement. you know, we've been hearing about it. and things went south very fast. trump gave the green light for software company oracle to take a big stake in tiktok and to control its u.s. data. walmart was also a major investor, but then tiktok parent company bytedance said, actually, not so fast; we don't want to lose control of the biggest app to ever come out of china. so talks have stalled.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, you know, i talked to the parties involved, and they say they have not given up. and for tiktok, rachel, you know, the stakes are just really, really, really high. the app - you know, if it ends up getting banned even temporarily, the company says, like, 90% of its users could quit and then hop over to competitors like instagram or, you know, one of the many other video apps that have sensed real opportunity here.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allyn: that's the question i get the most; you know, should i be worried about tiktok? that's the crux of the debate (ph). and, you know, the trump administration says having a chinese parent company like tiktok does is a national security threat and that china's authoritarian regime, you know, has unfettered access to private business. and there is consensus that that's a legitimate concern.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that said, the particular threat from tiktok - that's a lot shakier. the white house has never offered ironclad evidence that china can definitely get its hands on americans' data. and tiktok says it just operates completely independent of china. but those assurances are not cooling the heat from the white house.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "emanuel: that is only partially the problem. remember, as you pointed out, there are many, many popular provisions in the bill. people like the fact that they don't have to pay deductibles or co-pays for preventative services - that was part of the legislation - that there are essential benefits which everyone can get, including mental health benefits and other benefits for drugs. so there are lots of popular provisions of the bill. the only unpopular provision, by polling, is really the individual mandate. but lots and lots of individual provisions get, like, 75 or 80 percent of the public supporting it. and i think that's an important point.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ordoñez: yeah. he was at his golf course today where he issued some of these fiery statements. but it's interesting because the public comments - there's a contrast between those and the private conversations that are happening behind the scenes. i've been talking with a former campaign aide who tells me that the president is being advised that his legal options are limited. but it's been hard for him.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the company, which is the largest u.s. health insurer, has about 795,000 customers who bought plans for 2016 through the exchanges, which were created under the affordable care act. that's just a fraction of the 13 million people who bought obamacare plans this year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "officials at the department of health and human services, which administers the affordable care act and the federal healthcare.gov insurance exchange, say unitedhealth's plans were priced higher than many others. in at least seven states, more than 90 percent of residents could buy plans that were cheaper than unitedhealth's offerings.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "scott simon speaks with maggie elehwany of the national rural health association about a possible obamacare repeal. she supports the law, but says the way it was implemented has hurt rural hospitals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the house and senate have taken the first steps to dismantle the affordable care act. it's not clear whether lawmakers will have a replacement for the law before it's repealed. the affordable care act has allowed millions of americans to buy health insurance for the first time. but it has been controversial. we don't know the impact on hospitals. we're joined now by maggie elehwany. she's a lobbyist with the national rural health association. they represent nearly 2,000 hospitals in rural america. thanks for joining us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: recognizing that there's no one answer, how has the affordable care act affected rural hospitals?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elehwany: well, let's talk about kind of the overview. so the goal of the aca was to help the 37 million uninsured out there. and, yes, uninsurance rates have gone down dramatically or at historic lows. but i think a lot of things were unforeseen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the way some of the regulations were implemented are actually harming rural america and not fulfilling the ultimate goals of the aca. and what i mean by that is half of those 37 million - the goal was to expand medicaid and get those folks into a medicaid program. we know that a lot of states have taken the supreme court up on its option of opting out of medicaid. that has predominantly hurt rural america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, if you're a rural state, if you're a poor state, more likely than not, you have not expanded medicaid. so we're seeing millions of folks left behind at that. our concern is that since the aca was passed, we've had an escalation of rural hospitals close. we've had 80 rural hospitals close since 2010. if this rate continues, in less than 10 years' time, we're going to have 25 percent of rural hospitals close within less than a decade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: do you have any concern about the congress repealing the affordable care act - what's called obamacare - without a replacement?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elehwany: we certainly do. i do not want to take away, by any means, the good that it has done in rural america. i said it's brought uninsured rates down by 8 percent. it's allowed families to keep their children on their plan until they're age 26. it's helped people buy insurance if they've had preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we do not want to see rural americans lose one lapse in the benefits that they have. we are not mad at republicans or democrats. we're mad at republicans and democrats. we want to make sure that they understand that the well intentions of the aca have really fallen short and may actually be exacerbating the hospital-closure crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: we've done a little reporting. i've done some stories in rural hospitals and health care over the years. it can be hard to get doctors to some locations, can't it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: because they spend a long time in medical school. and there just aren't necessarily the opportunities for economic success in a rural environment that they would have in a big city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elehwany: that's absolutely true. recruitment and retention of physicians remains one of the top problems in rural-health-care delivery. and i talked about - to bring it back to the affordable care act, there was some other positive provisions in the affordable care act that, sadly, were never funded by congress through the appropriations process that we think really could've helped recruitment and retention of physicians. there were some specific programs targeted to help workforce issues in rural america. we would love to see, when we address building upon the aca, reforming it, those programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: what do you hope congress does?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elehwany: i'm not speaking in one political aisle or the other.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elehwany: but rural america spoke very loudly. on a 3-to-1 basis, they voted for donald trump. they were voting for a concept. i believe that they feel that they have been left behind. and if you think about it, it's not just health care, where they see their hospitals closing. and one hospital ceo described it as a three-pronged stool. it's the churches, the hospitals and the schools. if you lose one of those legs of that stool, the whole community collapses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so these towns with their hospital closing are seeing elements of their community go away. their physicians may leave 'cause they're hospital-based. the nurses leave. the pharmacists leave. these medical deserts are forming. you know, there's studies that show even housing values drop after a hospital closes. so what business wants to relocate to these communities?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "enlarge this image toggle caption tom williams/cq-roll call inc. tom williams/cq-roll call inc.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration is refusing to defend key parts of the affordable care act, essentially arguing that federal courts should find the health law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions unconstitutional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the federal lawsuit hinges on the aca's individual mandate, or the requirement to get health coverage or pay a penalty. the mandate has long been a sticking point for conservatives, who argue that the government should not be telling individuals what coverage they must have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that mandate was crucial to persuading insurers to offer plans under the aca. it helped expand their risk pools while the law forced them to guarantee coverage to any customer. insurers were not allowed to raise costs for people with pre-existing medical conditions. the administration's legal brief, filed thursday in federal district court in fort worth, texas, takes aim at those links.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "twenty republican state attorneys general filed suit on feb. 26, charging that congress' changes to the law in last year's tax bill rendered the entire aca unconstitutional. in the tax law, congress repealed the penalty for people who fail to have health insurance starting in 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the attorneys general argue that a supreme court decision in 2012 saved the aca from being declared an unconstitutional overreach of congressional power by declaring the penalty a tax — and pointing out that congress has the power to levy taxes. without the tax penalty, they argue, the court should hold that the aca is unlawful and enjoin its operation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration thursday did not go that far. rather, it argued that without the tax to encourage healthy people to sign up, the parts of the law guaranteeing coverage to people who have chronic illnesses or other pre-existing health conditions should be struck down as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the administration called on the court to declare that the provisions that guarantee coverage will be invalid beginning on january 1, 2019, when the mandate penalty goes away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here are five things to know about this latest in a long line of challenges to the health law:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. if this lawsuit succeeds, who will be affected?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people who buy their own insurance, usually because they are self-employed or don't get coverage through their jobs or the government, will be vulnerable. there are about 21 million people who do so, buying either through insurance brokers or from a state or federal affordable care act marketplace.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's not clear exactly how many americans have pre-existing conditions and could be affected. estimates vary widely because there is not a standard definition of what counts as a pre-existing condition. before the aca passed, insurers commonly refused coverage for people with cancer, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis and even less serious conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "based on those pre-aca examples, the kaiser family foundation estimates that 27 percent of people under age 65 have a pre-existing condition. of course, not all of them buy coverage on their own.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on friday, america's health insurance plans, an insurance industry trade group, criticized the federal government's filing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "zeroing out the individual mandate penalty should not result in striking important consumer protections that help guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, a written statement from the group said. removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. is anything going to change right away? what about next year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "don't look for big changes quite yet, though the move could boost premiums and reduce choices among plans as early as 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the lawsuit could easily go all the way to the supreme court before there is a resolution, which could take years. so the pre-existing condition protections are likely to stay in place during that period.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more immediately, there might be some effect on premiums for next year. health insurers are currently deciding whether to sell coverage in the individual market in 2019 — and what they're going to charge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the more uncertainty there is, the more the actuaries are going to be plugging into their projections for premium rates, says sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university's health policy institute.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but others say the legal brief may have minimal impact next year on premiums. that's because insurers already expected the trump administration would not defend the aca — and they know that a resolution of the case will be years away, says industry consultant robert laszewski.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a bigger effect on premiums, according to both corlette and laszewski, are factors already in play that are expected to draw younger and healthier people out of the aca marketplace. those include congress' decision to repeal the individual mandate penalty and rules expected soon from the administration that will expand the market for lower cost and short-term policies that won't have to follow all the aca rules.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. how is this lawsuit different from previous challenges to the aca?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the supreme court has twice upheld the constitutionality of the health law. most famously, in 2012, a narrow majority led by chief justice john roberts turned back a challenge that was also filed by republican attorneys general along with the national federation of independent business.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "roberts wrote in a 5-4 ruling that the requirement for most americans to either have insurance or pay a fine constitutes a tax — even though democrats had gone to great lengths to not call it a tax — and was therefore constitutional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2015, the court ruled that congress did not intend to provide financial aid exclusively for premiums to individuals in states that operated their own insurance exchanges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this current lawsuit, led by texas attorney general ken paxton and wisconsin attorney general brad schimel, argues that since congress has changed the law to remove the penalty forcing individuals to get insurance, it has inadvertently rendered the rest of the law impermissible, under the 2012 supreme court ruling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "texans have known all along that obamacare is unlawful and a divided supreme court's approval rested solely on the flimsy support of congress' authority to tax, said paxton when the suit was filed. congress has now kicked that flimsy support from beneath the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "other legal observers point out that's not how the lawmaking process works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "congress is always free to amend its statutes, even to omit what it previously thought was essential, writes nick bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan, in a thursday evening blog post. that's what congress did when it zeroed out the mandate. so we don't have to speculate what congress would've done if it had a choice between invalidating the aca's insurance reforms or just invalidating the mandate. congress made that choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. if the trump administration isn't going to defend the health law in this lawsuit, who will?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in may, the court allowed more than a dozen state attorneys general, all democrats, to intervene in the case and defend the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the goal of texas' lawsuit is to leave americans without health insurance, forcing them to choose between their health and other needs, says california attorney general xavier becerra. allowing the democratic officials to join the suit allows us to protect the health and well-being of these americans by defending affordable access to health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. if nothing is going to happen right away, why is this such a big deal?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the guarantees for coverage for people with pre-existing conditions are among those most valued by the public. even if the lawsuit stands little chance of success, putting those provisions back in play can create uncertainty for insurers and patients this summer and fall. it could also possibly provide democrats another talking point for the coming midterm elections in november.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "legal specialists also point out that the trump administration's failure to defend the federal health law could have long-lasting implications for the rule of law in the nation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the justice department can just throw in the towel whenever a law is challenged in court, it can effectively pick and choose which laws should remain on the books, wrote bagley. that's as flagrant a violation of the president's constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed as you can imagine.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "president trump says he wants republicans to be known as the party of health care. so how do they achieve that, given their record? when they controlled both houses of congress, the promises to repeal obamacare and replace it with something better ended in nothing. more recently, the trump administration backed a lawsuit to overturn the affordable care act with no replacement in sight. now, the president does say he is counting on senators to fill that gap - senators including rick scott, our next guest. he is a former hospital executive and former governor of florida, now a newly inaugurated united states senator. senator, good morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rick scott: good morning. that's right. the - well, let's - i think we can all thank the president for his interest in health care. i've been involved in health care all my life. and so i'm glad with that. and i'm going to work hard to try to drive down the cost of health care. that'd be the most important thing to americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: well, you said drive down the cost. let's talk about what the republican approach really is here. from talking with others senate republicans, we get the impression the idea is to really stop trying to repeal and replace obamacare and just find some narrower improvements in the existing system. is that a fair description?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott: well that's what i'm doing. steve, drug prices are too high. so i put a bill out last week that would require transparency, so you know what things cost. but on top of that, americans - it's not fair that we pay more for drugs than europeans pay. i had the same problem when i was in the health care business. i had hospitals in america and in europe. and the drug companies wanted to charge us more in america. and i said, that's not fair. and i'm not going to do it. and i think we have to have the exact same attitude. why are we paying more than europeans or canadians or japanese for drug prices? that's my bill. that's what i'm focused on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: you're going for, in a sense, a free market solution. you want more transparency so that people know what they're paying. and maybe they can shop around for cheaper drugs at pharmacies and that sort of thing. but isn't it still going to be really hard for the average consumer to navigate such a complicated system where, in the end, insurance companies, they would hope, are paying most of the bills?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott: oh, look. i think that it's difficult. but i grew up in a family that didn't have money. and i remember asking my mom one time, how much would it cost - how much would there be a change in a drug, you know, if you're going to pay for it before you would change pharmacies? she said, less than a buck. i think if we tell people - give people information, they'll make good decisions. one of the companies i had in health care was a walk-in doctor's office company who put all the prices up on a menu board, so people could decide, do i want my insurance, or do i want to pay out of pocket? and it worked. so i think transparency works. i think giving people information works. but on top of that, we - the drug companies have raised their prices too fast. and so we're going to - i want to stop them from being able to charge us more than they charge europeans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: i want to ask about another source of costs in the health care industry, one with which you have direct experience - hospitals. you founded a large hospital corporation. and a lot of people - laymen - will know that hospitals are famous for charging immense bills which are often inexplicable to us. presumably, insurance firms will just pay them. but there is this huge bill. are hospitals a big part of the problem?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott: i think you have to look at - the entire delivery system is an issue. we - i passed legislation when i was governor to require hospitals to disclose their prices. we've got to make this more simplistic, more transparent, so you as a consumer have better information. and that's true for the pharmacies. that's true for the hospitals. that's true for the insurance companies. take insurance companies as an example. you probably know if you're on a stat (ph), as an example. insurance companies should tell you what your copayment is before you buy the insurance that year. and they shouldn't change it on you for the 12 months. i mean, that's not fair. and so i think every part of this - we need to have - what i always thought about it is you've got to have more competition. and you've got to let people make more of the decisions on their own. they'll spend their money smartly if they have the information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: now, you, of course, are in a senate where i'm sure every republican and every democrat will be in favor, in theory, of lower prescription drug prices. do you believe there is sufficient bipartisan support for the same approach to this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott: well, clearly - i was in the budget committee last week. and everybody, including bernie sanders, was all in on lower drug prices. i think this idea that we should not pay more than europeans pay - i think that's pretty common sense. and so i'm optimistic that we can get that done. i think - look. it's very partisan. i've just been up here three months. it's a partisan place. but that's why you've got to find things that everybody agrees on to get it done. i mean, look. we've got a divided congress. and even in the senate, takes 60 votes. so it takes democrats to be onboard to get anything done, which - i'm fine with that. we ought to figure out how to work together.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kodjak: exactly. but last week, the trump administration changed its position and said it wants the law overturned in court. if it gets its way, that's going to leave a huge void in the health care system. and it doesn't look like the senate's looking to step up and find a replacement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kodjak: well, the bill he is introducing is about drug prices, which is not a replacement for the affordable care act. it's not going to get people insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. and this lawsuit actually overturns that law. it is - the issue of drug prices is very important. and lowering health care costs is very important. senator scott - the other thing that he talked about - he focused on drug prices but slid over the issue of hospital costs. he's a former hospital executive. hospital costs are much higher, generally, than drug prices. they take up a huge share of the medical costs that this country spends. drug prices are rising faster.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: if i'm concerned about my insurance costs, hospitals are a huge part of that, even though drug prices get the attention?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it was a tumultuous decade in politics that saw everything from the presidency and reelection of the first black president to the rise of the tea party and the improbable election of donald trump as president. the 2010s were marred by political polarization and gridlock, as american society struggled to deal with changing demography and a white grievance backlash.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here are some of the top moments of the decade that helped reshape american politics.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama's signature legislation brought down the number of uninsured in the country dramatically. it also led to the rise of the tea party and sweeping democratic officeholder losses across the country. despite dozens of gop attempts to repeal it, the health care law remains a permanent fixture in american society.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's notable how the politics, especially of democrats, have changed on the law since the aca was passed. progressives back then were pushing obama for a public option, but tactically democratic leadership didn't think it could pass. today, as is being fought out on the 2020 campaign trail, many progressives now see even a public option as not going far enough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the rise of the tea party", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the republican party was reshaped by the rise of the tea party. the gop rode the 2010 tea party wave to take over the house, but governing proved difficult. legislative priorities were unclear, as tea party conservatives cared most about cutting and restraining spending — not compromise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that lack of compromise fueled government shutdowns and a debt-ceiling standoff that led to the first-ever u.s. credit downgrade. the tea party phenomenon also eventually ran a speaker out of congress. john boehner's hands were tied by his right flank of hardliners, who would not let him negotiate to the point he might have with president obama.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "boehner, in fact, notably said he would not use the word compromise. i reject that word, boehner said in 2010. he tried to thread the needle with the phrase common ground instead, but to no avail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a direct through-line can be drawn from the tea party to president trump. many people in tea party crowds espoused conspiracy theories about obama, including the false and racist birther narrative. trump was a leader of the birther movement, and with him in the white house, conservative base supporters who were integral to the tea party's success don't seem to care as much about deficits that have only grown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the tea party may have also been a leading indicator of what's happening within the democratic party. obama led to the tea party, which led to trump, who is leading to progressives rejecting the idea of compromise being a smart thing to do. and that's also playing out in the 2020 democratic primary.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davis: well, i disagree with the statements. and i've talked to many doctors over my time in washington over the last four years who were very frustrated with the current status quo, with the affordable care act as implemented. doctors that i talked to are seeing less patients because of the compliance issues that they have to follow under obamacare. we want to make the system better, and i look forward to having their input. but i would argue looking in illinois, where we've had 45 to 55 - and friends of mine have had 87 percent increases in their premiums - obamacare's already costly. and frankly, the promise for families of saving $2,500 on average did not come true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "singh: well, as you're well aware, there has been pushback from the right as well, a lot of republicans, especially in the senate, who say that this bill does not go far enough in repealing the current health care law, the affordable care act, also widely known as obamacare. rand paul has called the republican plan obamacare lite. what do you make of his resistance to this current bill?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: well, i know rand. rand's a friend of mine. i think this is a publicity stunt, though, that is not based on facts. his own plan has refundable tax credits just like our plan does. you know, i want to make sure that we don't just pull the rug out from those who are dependent on coverage, those who may need the assistance through our medicaid programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think our program as designed is a great off-ramp to be able to get to a system that's going to be affordable for every single american, that's going to stop the collapsing status quo we know as obamacare, and also actually be able to provide opportunities for families to get off of medicaid and then be able to afford the coverage that they need or be offered more affordable coverage through their employers or future employers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "singh: well, congressman davis, we know, though, that this is probably not going to be smooth sailing for this bill to be approved. there is enough resistance that there are going to be obstacles to getting to where you want to get. what is it going to take, you think, to get enough republicans to bend behind this bill finally?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. you wouldn't believe what some emergency rooms charge, or maybe you would because you've gotten bills. for example, one hospital charged $76 for bacitracin antibacterial ointment. one woman who fell and cut her ear and was given an ice pack but no other treatment was billed $5,751. my guest, sarah kliff, is a health policy journalist at vox.com who spent over a year investigating why er bills are so high even with health insurance and why the charges vary so widely from one hospital to the next.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sarah kliff, welcome back to fresh air. why did you want to do an investigation into emergency room billing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sarah kliff: you know, i wanted to do this because the emergency room is such a common place where americans interact with the health care system. there are about 140 million er visits each year. it's a place where you can't really shop for health care. you can't make a lot of decisions about where you want to go. so i think that is big-picture what got me interested.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "small picture was actually a bill that someone sent me almost three years ago now, where they took their daughter to the emergency room. a band-aid was put on the daughter's finger, and they left. and they got a $629 bill. and they said - you know, they - the parents sent this to me, saying, how could a band-aid cost $629? and i said, i don't know, but i'm going to find out. and that kind of opened up the door to this, you know, multi-year project i've been working on right now. it started with trying to figure out why a band-aid would cost $629.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: ok. so let's get to that $629 for treatment that was basically a band-aid placed on a finger. you investigated that bill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: why'd it cost so much?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so what cost so much was really the facility fee. so this is a charge i hadn't heard about before as a health care reporter. this is a charge that hospitals make for just keeping their doors open, keeping the lights on, the cost of running an emergency room 24/7. so if you look at that particular patient's bill, the band-aid - you know, i hesitate to say only - but the band-aid only cost $7, which, as anyone who's bought band-aids knows, is quite expensive for a single band-aid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the other $622 of that bill were the hospital's facility fees for just walking in the door and seeking service. and these fees are not made public. they vary wildly from one hospital to another. and usually patients only find out what the facility fee of their hospital is when they receive the bill afterwards, like that patient, you know, that sent me this particular bill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: and does the facility fee vary from facility to facility?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: it does significantly. you know, i've seen some that are in the low hundreds. i've seen some that are in the high thousands. and it's impossible to know what facility fee you're going to be charged until you actually get the billing documents from your hospital. and if you try and call up a hospital and ask what the facility fee is, usually you won't get very far.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it's this fee that, from all the er bills i've read, is usually the biggest line item on the bill. but it's also one that is very, very difficult to get good information about until you've already been charged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so you're paying the facility fee to basically share in the cost of running the emergency room.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yes, that's how hospital executives would describe the fee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: but you don't know that when you're going to the emergency room.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you don't, no. and you don't know how much it'll be. you don't know how it's being split up between different patients. you don't know any of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so is this also why one bill had $60 for the treatment of ibuprofen and another $238 for the treatment of eyedrops?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. and, you know, this is something i see all the time reading emergency bills - i've read about 1,500 of them at this point - is that things you could buy in a drugstore often cost significantly more in the emergency room. and the people i talked to who run hospitals will say this is because they have to be open all the time. they have to have so many supplies ready.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think one of the things that i find pretty frustrating is, you know, patients aren't usually told, we can give you an ibuprofen here, or you can pick some up at the drugstore if you leave, and the cost will be a fraction of what we would charge you here. that information often isn't conveyed to patients who are well enough, you know, to go to a drugstore on their own. but it's just huge variation for these simple items.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one place i see this a lot is pregnancy tests. if you're a woman who's of childbearing age, you go to the emergency room, they will often want to check if you're pregnant. i've seen pregnancy tests that cost a few dollars in emergency room. the most expensive one i saw was over $400. i believe that was at a hospital in texas. it's just widespread variation for, you know, some pretty simple pieces of medical equipment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: i want to get back to the $60 ibuprofen. is that - does that include the facility fee? or is that just for the ibuprofen, and the facility fee is separate?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: that's just for the ibuprofen. the facility fee is totally separate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so how do they justify that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: they say they have to stock, like, a wide array of medicine, so they have to have everything on hand from ibuprofen, from, you know, expensive rabies treatments - i've talked to a lot of people who've been to the emergency room for exposure to bats and raccoons - and that they need to have all these things in stock. and, you know, one of the things you pay for at the emergency room is the ability to get any medication at any hour of the day right when you need it. i don't necessarily buy that explanation, to be clear. that's what i've heard from hospital executives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it's pretty telling that ibuprofen has a very, very different price depending on which emergency room you go to. the fact that there's so much widespread price variation suggests to me that it's not just the cost of doing business driving it, that there's also business decisions being made behind ibuprofen that are driving the prices different hospitals are setting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: now, of course, trips to the emergency room aren't always as simple as getting a band-aid or ibuprofen or some eyedrops. i want you to describe the case of a young man who was hit by a pole on a city bus in san francisco.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. so this patient, his name is justin. he was a community college student in northern california, was walking down a sidewalk in downtown san francisco one day. and there was a pole hanging off the back of the bus that wasn't where it's supposed to be. it essentially flew off the back of the bus, hit him in the face and knocked him unconscious.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but, you know, as i began figuring out through my reporting, san francisco general does not contract with private insurance, and they end up pursuing him for the vast majority of that bill. he has $27,000 outstanding. and somewhat ironically, san francisco general, it is the city hospital. it is run by the city of san francisco. so this student is hit by a city bus, taken by an ambulance to the city hospital and ends up with a $27,000 bill as a result.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so did he have insurance?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: he did. he had insurance through his dad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so why doesn't zuckerberg san francisco general hospital contract with private insurers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so what they have told me when i've talked to some spokespeople there is that they are a safety net hospital, and that is, you know, definitely true. they generally serve a lower-income, often indigent population in san francisco that would have trouble getting admitted and seeking care at other hospitals in the city. so they have told me that their focus is on serving those patients and that therefore, you know, they're not going to contract with private insurance companies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the thing i found a little bit confusing about that, though, is there are lots of public hospitals, say, that, you know, also serve low-income populations. and some of them for their inpatient units, you know, for their scheduled surgeries, they're not going to contract with private insurance because they want to make sure beds are available for the publicly insured folks and people on medicaid and medicare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when it comes to the emergency room, you know, every other public hospital i was in touch with would contract with private insurers there because people don't decide if they're going to end up in the emergency room. so, you know, that's the justification they offered, that it is a hospital meant to serve those with public insurance. but it is not something you see public hospitals typically doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: isn't - i think legislation was proposed in california to change that. did that pass?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: it's still pending in the california state assembly. and the hospital has also promised to reform its billing practices, although we haven't seen what exactly their new plan is yet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so the position that justin was in is that, like, he's unconscious. he's not asking to be taken anyplace. (laughter) but he's unconscious. he's taken to the emergency room and ends up getting this $27,000 bill. i mean, that just seems so unfair, especially since he has insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: like, it's supposed to cover him for things like that (laughter).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. you know, there's one other patient who kind of makes this point really well who was also seen at san francisco general. her name is nelly. and she fell off a climbing wall and, somewhat amazingly, you know, turns out she had a concussion. but one of the first things she does is she calls her insurance's nursing hotline to ask, should i go to the er?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they say yes. and she says, can i go to zuckerberg san francisco general? it's the closest. they say, no, don't go there. it's not in network. go to another hospital. she gets to the other hospital, but the other hospital won't see her because she's a trauma patient. she fell from a really high height. and san francisco general is the only trauma center in san francisco. so she tries to go to an in-network hospital. she's then ambulance-transferred to zuckerberg san francisco general, and she ends up with another bill over $20,000 that the hospital was pursuing from her until i started asking questions from it, and the hospital ultimately dropped the bill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think it's just such a frustrating situation for someone like justin, for someone like nellie (ph). they're either shopping for this good unconscious, they're really trying to do the right thing, and the health care system is just so stacked against the patient. it's so stacked for the hospital to be able to bill the prices that they want to bill.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so we're going to take a short break, and then we'll talk more about emergency billing. and then later, we'll talk about what's left of obamacare, and what the president and congress and candidates are saying about health care, after this break. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so we were talking about the hidden facility fee, which most people don't know exists, and is responsible for a large chunk of a lot of emergency room bills. there's also, like, a trauma unit fee. it's a similar hidden fee in hospitals that have trauma centers in their emergency rooms. so explain the trauma fee and how that kicks in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. this is something i also had never heard of till i started reading a lot of emergency room bills, and this is the fee that trauma centers charge for essentially assembling a trauma team to meet you when you're coming in and those folks out in the field, maybe the emts, for example, have determined that you meet certain trauma criteria.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i've talked to people who have been charged trauma fees who were in serious car accidents. one case was a baby who fell from more than 3 feet, and that's considered to trigger a trauma activation. so this is essentially the price for having a robust trauma team - a surgeon, an anesthesiologist, nurses - all at the ready to receive you when you get to the hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and again, these fees can be pretty hefty. san francisco general, which, i've done the most reporting on their billing, you know, they can charge up to $18,000 for their trauma activation services. i wrote about one family who was visiting san francisco from korea when their young son rolled out of the hotel bed. they were nervous. they didn't know the american health care system well. so they called 911, which sent an ambulance, brought him over to the hospital. turns out, he was fine. they gave him a bottle of formula. he took a nap and went home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then a few months later, they get an $18,000 charge for the trauma team that assembled for when that baby came to the hospital. and these are another, you know, pretty significant fee that, again, you don't really know about. you have no idea that the trauma team is assembling to meet you when you're coming into the hospital. you just find out after the fact. and you also have no say in the decision to assemble trauma. that's really left up to the hospital, not the patient.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so i'm going to have you compare two possibilities. you go to an emergency room, and the bill is very high. there's two people who have the same problem who go to the emergency room. one of them has a copay. one of them has a high deductible that they haven't paid off yet. how are they treated differently, in terms of what they're billed for the emergency room visit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: well, the person with the deductible will likely be billed significantly more. you know, if they're just, let's say, at the start of the year, they are going to essentially have to bear the costs of that emergency room visit up until the point they hit their deductible and the insurance kicks in, whereas the person who has a co-payment, they're just going to have to pay that flat fee and, you know, probably not worry about paying more, but there's often surprise bills lurking in the corner that could affect both of those patients as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so one of the most common things we see is out-of-network doctors working at in-network emergency rooms. so you know, you have an emergency, you look up a hospital, you see their er is in network, so you go there. it turns out that emergency room is staffed by doctors who aren't in your insurance. there's pretty compelling academic research that suggests 1 in 5 emergency room visits involves a surprise bill like that one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: that seems so unfair. how are you to know - if you're choosing a hospital that's in network, how are you to know whether the doctor treating you is in network or not?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, you really - there isn't a great way to tell, to be honest. this is - you know, when i had to go to the emergency room over the summer, you know, this is something i worried about. you know, i was seeing a doctor who worked for the hospital, but they were sending off my ultrasound to be read by a radiologist who i was never going to meet. i couldn't ask them if they were in-network. i just kind of had to cross my fingers and hope for the best, and luckily, i didn't get a surprise bill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i've talked to multiple patients who, you know, tried to do their research, who thought they were in network, only to get a bill, often for thousands of dollars, after leaving the emergency room, from someone who, you know, never mentioned to them, hey, i'm not in your network like this hospital is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so the bill that you'd get would be for the difference between what you pay when somebody is - when a doctor's in network and what you pay when they're not in network?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, often it's just what that out-of-network doctor wants to charge. so a good example of this is a patient i wrote about in texas named scott (ph), who was attacked in downtown austin, left on the street unconscious, some bystander called him an ambulance, and he woke up at a hospital. and one of the first things he does, because this is the united states, is he gets on his phone and tries to figure out which hospital he is at, and, you know, is that in his insurance network? and he finds out - good news - it is. and a surgeon comes by, tells him he's going to need emergency jaw surgery because of the attack that happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so he says, ok. you know, he's not really in a place to go anywhere. gets the surgery. goes home. a few weeks later, he gets an $8,000 bill from that oral surgeon, who the insurance companies paid a smaller amount. the oral surgeon didn't have a contract with the insurance and said, you know, i think my services are worth a lot more, so pursued the balance of the bill from scott.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: i have to say, i mean, that does seem unfair to the patient because they haven't been informed. they can't make a choice about it if they don't know. and, like, $8,000 is a lot of money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. and i think, you know, even more, let's say he did say he was out of network. it kind of puts the patient in an unfair situation, too. you know, one of the things we talk about a lot in health policy is, what if we had more transparency? what if we let patients know the prices? what if we let patients know who is in and out of network? and that - it would be a good step.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, you know, i think with someone like scott, sitting in a hospital with a broken jaw, there's not much you can do with that information. he doesn't have, you know, the ability to go home, like, research, like, make an appointment with a new surgeon. so, you know, it'd be great if he knew that the doctor was out of network. it'd be even better if he had some kind of protections against those type of bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what kind of protection could there be?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so we're actually seeing a lot of action on this in congress. there's some pretty strong bipartisan support for tackling this specific issue and essentially holding the patient harmless. when there is a situation like scott's, for example, where there's this $8,000 bill, that's really a dispute between a health insurance company and a doctor, where the doctor says, i want more money, the insurer says, i want to pay you less money. and what congress wants to do - what a few states have already done with their laws - is said, you can't go to the patient for that money. you, the hospital, and you, the health insurance company, you have to get down to a table and work things out together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and some state laws will set certain amounts that are allowed to be charged, other ones will force the insurance company and the hospital into an arbitration process. but the general concept is to take the patient out of this billing situation because, like you said, terry, they really aren't in a position to negotiate. they aren't in a position to shop. they shouldn't be the ones who are left holding the bag at the end of the day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: my guest is sarah kliff. she covers health policy for vox. after a break, we'll talk more about why er bills can have some unpleasant surprises, and she'll give us an update on obamacare. and maureen corrigan will review two books about forgotten stories from hollywood. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(soundbite of jessica williams trio's kristen)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with journalist sarah kliff, who covers health policy and how it affects people for vox. for the past year and a half, she's been writing about why emergency room visits can be so expensive and the pricing so secretive and mysterious, as well as inconsistent from one hospital to the next. she collected over 1,000 bills and tracked down stories behind the billing. she interviewed many of the patients and the people behind the billing to decipher why er bills can have some surprise costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's another surprise that often awaits people who go to emergency rooms - some insurance plans only cover true emergencies, and whether it is a true emergency is sometimes determined after the diagnosis is made. so how are you supposed to know before the diagnosis whether you're going to be categorized as a true emergency or not? like, if you go to the hospital, you don't know if you have a broken bone or not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: somebody needs to x-ray it and tell you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: right. the whole point you go to the emergency room is to help them figure out what the emergency is and what treatment you need. this is a policy that the insurance company anthem has been pioneering for a few years. it's been in kentucky. it's been in georgia - a few other states. and, you know, i wrote about one patient out in kentucky named brittany, who - she was having really severe abdominal pain. she called her mom who is a nurse, and the nurse said, that might be appendicitis. you've got to get to the emergency room. turns out it wasn't appendicitis. it was an ovarian cyst. she got it treated elsewhere later down the line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and anthem, you know, sent her a letter saying, we're not going to cover that visit because it was not a true emergency. she appealed it. her appeal was denied. this is another one where, once i started asking them about it, the bill suddenly disappeared. but - and it seems like as anthem has gotten more attention for this policy - they haven't announced it publicly, but some pretty compelling data the new york times got their hands on suggest they've backed off this policy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's just, you know - there are so many traps you can fall into going into an emergency room. it just feels like you're walking into this minefield, and this is kind of one of those mines that's lurking in there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: hospital pricing and emergency room pricing seems to vary so much from hospital to hospital. are there, like, national guidelines that help determine what a hospital or a hospital emergency room charges for services? i mean, who decides, and why is there such a variation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so hospital executives get to decide, and i think that is why there is such variation. there aren't really guidelines that they're following. you know, one thing you could do as a hospital executive - you could look at what medicare charges - those prices are public - and, you know, maybe use that as a benchmark. there are some databases. there's one called fair health, for example, where you could look and see, you know, some information on what local prices typically are. but in terms of, you know, what you want to charge, that's kind of up to you as someone running a hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the things that's really, really unique about the united states, compared to our peer countries, is that we don't regulate health care prices. nearly every other country in the developed world - they see health care something as, you know, akin to a utility that everyone needs, like electricity or water. it's so important that the government is going to step in and regulate the prices. that doesn't happen in the united states. you know, if you're a hospital, you just choose your prices. and, you know, that is, i think, why you see so much variation and why you see some really high prices in american health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so what advice do you have for people who actually need an emergency room and don't want to get hit with a shocking bill afterwards?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, this is, you know, one of those questions - it just makes me a little frustrated that - 'cause this is the most common question i get - right? - is, how do i - how do we - how do i prevent a surprise bill? and i find it kind of upsetting that, you know, it has to be on the patient because honestly, there really isn't a great way to do this. i've talked to so many patients who tried so hard to avoid a big medical bill and weren't able to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there's certain things, yes, you can do. you can look up the network status of your hospital. you can try and badger each doctor you see about whether they are in network. you can try to be a really proactive patient, but i think that's just such a huge burden on people who are in, like, really emergent situations. and some people don't have that opportunity, you know, like justin zanders, the guy we were talking about earlier who was taken to a hospital while he was unconscious. i cannot think of anything he could've done to avoid that bill. it just was not possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so your advice is, good luck.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: short of that, i mean, good luck. you know, i'm actually in the middle of reporting a story right now about people who have successfully negotiated down their bills. and, you know, you can certainly - if you do end up with a surprise bill, you can call up the hospital, see if there's a discount. sometimes there will be. sometimes there won't. you can call again. customer service representatives - different ones - often offer you different discounts, i've learned from interviewing patients. you can ask for a prompt pay discount if you pay right away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can - you know, one health attorney who negotiates these a lot on behalf of patients - he says one of his favorite tactics is to choose the amount you want to pay; send a check with that amount; and in the note, write, paid in full; and hope they don't come after you after that. i have no idea if that works or not, but he says it works for his patients. but it's a mixed bag. and at the end of the day, the hospital has all the power. you can ask for discounts. you can ask nicely. you can ask angrily. it's up to the hospital if they want to grant you that or not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so what is the status of obamacare now? you know, republicans promised to repeal and replace. that didn't work out. so have republicans given up on repeal and replace?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: for the time, it seems pretty clear that repeal and replace is dead on arrival, especially with democrats taking control of the house this year. those proposals aren't being talked about as much. they're not really going anywhere. the one big thing we did see republicans succeed at is repealing obamacare's individual mandate, the requirement that all of us carry health insurance. that happened as part of the big tax package that passed at the end of 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we've seen, you know, president trump, for example, essentially declare victory, declare that repealing the individual mandate is repealing obamacare, so we're good on that goal. but, you know, generally, obamacare is still standing. there are millions of people getting their coverage through the affordable care act still today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so now that there's no individual mandate, conservative attorney generals are challenging obamacare - the affordable care act - and saying it's no longer constitutional after congress's repeal of the individual mandate. could you explain that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, so this is a challenge that's come up through the courts in the past few months. obamacare is constantly being challenged in court. it's been through multiple supreme court suits. this one - you know, it's a multiple-part argument, so i'll try my best to walk through it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so essentially, it starts with the fact that the individual mandate - they weren't quite able to repeal it for boring technical reasons. but what they were able to do is change the fee for not having health insurance from $700 to $0. so it - in all practical terms, it feels like repealing it because there is no fee for not carrying health insurance. the individual mandate was upheld as a tax when the supreme court said, yes, this is constitutional. the government has a right to tax people. now that there is no fee associated with not carrying health insurance, the conservative attorneys general who are bringing this case argue that it's not a tax anymore, and therefore, it is not constitutional. that whole defense that john roberts wrote in 2012 is moot. so that's the first part of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they go even further and say the individual mandate is so core to the affordable care act, it is not severable. and if you, the courts, rule the individual mandate unconstitutional, then you need to rule all of obamacare unconstitutional. and the first judge who heard this case - he is a, you know, judge in a district court in texas. he agreed with them. he agreed that - first step - that the individual mandate is no longer constitutional. and second step, that means that the entirety of obamacare has to fall. this is now being appealed up to the 5th circuit court of appeals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i will say there are a lot of critics of this case. there are a lot of people who were parties to previous supreme court challenges to obamacare who think this is a bad legal argument and that it will not succeed. but it is already, you know, gone through the district court level. it's moving up to the appellate court level. it is something that is in the mix that could become a threat to the affordable care act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, if it goes to the supreme court, it would be very interesting to see what justice roberts says since he voted for the aca, saying that the individual mandate was a tax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. you know, and i think where some legal scholars would see it shaking out is that the - someone like john roberts, he might agree, ok, yeah, the individual mandate is unconstitutional, but would not make the leap to the second half of this, that the rest of the law has to fall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think one of the most compelling arguments against this case is that congress knew what they were doing when they repealed the individual mandate. you know, they had the opportunity to repeal obamacare. they didn't. they'd specifically took aim at this one specific part. so it feels like it might be a bit of a reach to argue that what congress really meant to do was repeal all these other parts of the affordable care act. but, you know, the supreme court is changing. we have a new justice. you know, we have a lot in the mix. so it's always an open question of how a decision like this could go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so correct me if i'm wrong here - the department of justice has sided with the conservative attorneys general who are challenging obamacare, saying it's no longer constitutional, and i think that the justice department is also asking the judge to strike down the aca's mandatory coverage of pre-existing conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, that's right. so it's a kind of unusual situation. usually, it's the justice department that is going to defend a federal law in court. but, you know, given the trump administration's opposition to the affordable care act, they have decided to side with the conservative attorneys general. they have a slightly different argument. they don't think all of obamacare should fall if the mandate falls, but they do think some big parts, like you mentioned, the protections for pre-existing conditions, should be ruled unconstitutional if the mandate falls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so this has led to a bit of an unusual situation where you've had this coalition of democratic attorneys general step in and take over the case, basically saying that the federal government is going - is not going to defend the affordable care act. we are going to defend the affordable care act. so you have this coalition of democratic attorneys general, led by the attorney general of california, stepping in and, you know, offering a defense as this case works its way up through the court system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and then i think one of the things you're also going to see is whoever is the democratic nominee is probably going to run on obamacare. they are going to point at the fact that president trump tried to repeal the affordable care act. that's pretty different than, you know, the 2012 election, where democrats were pretty scared to run on obamacare. it still wasn't popular. the benefits hadn't rolled out. in this past midterm and now again in the 2020 election, it seems pretty clear that democrats are pretty excited to point out that republicans wanted to repeal obamacare. so i think it really will come up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what are some of the biggest falsehoods you've heard from politicians about health insurance costs or health insurance policy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, one of the ones that's come up a lot is actually around the role of private health insurance. so i've - i don't know if it counts as a falsehood, but i think it's a bit of a misunderstanding of how health insurance often works is, you know, when i talk to single-payer supporters, most of them want to eliminate private insurance completely. they just don't think there is a role for it in the health care system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and one of the things i think that's actually pretty interesting, when you look at any other country - you look at canada, you look at the u.k., you look at france, which all have national health care systems - all of them have a private health insurance market, too. there are always some kind of gap in the system that the public insurance can't cover, where the government step - where the private industry steps in and offers coverage. in canada, for example, their public health plan doesn't cover prescription drugs, so two-thirds of canadians take out a private plan, often through their employer, like us, to cover prescription drugs, to cover their eyeglasses, to cover their dental. so i think that's a confusion i see a lot in the medicare for all debate coming up right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think the other thing i see a lot of confusion around - and we've talked about this a little bit with emergency room billing - is the role of transparency in health care. i see a lot of, you know, if we just made the prices public, like, that is what we need to do to fix the system, and i think that really misses the fact that, even if the prices were public, health care is so different from everything else we shop for. it might be - i think it is the only thing we purchase when we are unconscious.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: and when you're unconscious, you're not really going to be great at price shopping. so i see that as, you know, a halfway solution that i often hear talked about here in washington that would be great but is not going to suddenly result in, you know, prices dropping because they've been exposed in a spotlight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: is there a country that you think has a good health care model that we could borrow?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: oh, yeah. i've been thinking about this a lot lately actually. so i've gotten very interested in the australia health care system, which is a little far away. but i think they're a really interesting model because they have a public system, everyone's enrolled in it, but they also really aggressively try and get people to buy a private plan, too, and that private plan will get you sometimes faster access to doctors, maybe a private room at a hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's really hard for me to see the u.s. creating a health care system, similar to canada's actually, where you can't buy private insurance, where if you're rich or you're poor, everyone waits in the exact same queue, you can't jump to the front of the line. because i think wealthier americans have gotten so used to having really good access to health care that they would be very upset with a system like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think australia is a kind of interesting hybrid between, you know, where we're at in the u.s. right now and what canada is like, where it says, yes, we're going to create a public system for everybody, but we're also going to have these private plans that compete against the public system. so i've become increasingly, you know, interested in how australia's system works. and they have - about 47 percent of australians are buying a private plan to cover the same benefits that the public plan does.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so it's not supplemental. it's instead of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: right. so it's very different from canada. so in canada, you can buy complementary insurance, you know, to cover the benefits the public plan doesn't but the government expressly outlaws supplemental insurance. you know, like, what people buy here to cover the gaps in medicare, that is not allowed. you cannot buy your way to the front of the line in canada.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of my favorite sayings about the canadian health care system is from a doctor in a book i read about canadian health care is they said, you know, we're fine waiting in lines for health care in canada as long as the rich people and the poor people have to wait in the exact same line. their system is all about equality. and i just don't know that we're at a place as a country where we value the same sort of equality in our health care system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kliff: absolutely not. there's nothing like it. i mean, our system is so unique. i'd say the closest but it's not even close are a few countries that have national health care systems, but they do it through tightly regulated private health insurance plans. so if you look at, like, netherlands or israel, there isn't a government-run plan. instead, in both countries, you actually have four tightly regulated health insurance plans that compete against each other for the citizens' business. i guess that's the closest, but that is so different from what we have here right now. there's really nothing like it in any developed country.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kurtzleben: yeah. i mean, listen. what that moment was for me was really important for two big reasons. one is that it was a sort of change in tone for elizabeth warren, who was at center stage. all eyes were on her. she has co-sponsored a medicare for all bill, the one that senator bernie sanders has introduced. but in interviews, she had been kind of loose on how to get there. she would say, you know, first, we have to stabilize the affordable care act - or obamacare. and then she would say, you know, there are multiple paths to get to medicare for all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "marc short: thank you for having me, michel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so this certainly isn't the first time, you know, that a white house has had to deal with a house majority of a different political ideology. you know, most recently president obama had to navigate a republican congress after his first couple of years in the white house. so i wondered if you took any lessons from how that played out in thinking about how you planned the legislative work at the white house those first two years. for example, did you front-load the legislative agenda thinking that this might happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "short: i don't know how much we front-loaded it, michel. i will tell you that i sat down with people who'd served in the obama administration of legislative affairs so i could get guidance and advice from them. and that was incredibly helpful as to how we should think through working with congress. but, you know, the reality was that somewhere to the obama administration, when they had control the first two years - that's when you saw the most significant amount of their legislative agenda accomplished.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, for the trump administration, obviously there's an effort to repeal obamacare that we fell short on. but the tax reform agenda, the regulatory agenda, the confirmation of judges certainly were big things they were able to be accomplished on a partisan manner. as you say, the next couple years, it's a question of what can actually be accomplished in a bipartisan manner, which is a different equation entirely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: what kind of conversations are they having right now in your old office?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "short: i'm probably more bullish, michel, in believing there's actually more that can get accomplished. i think that the president always had more affinity for the democrat plan on infrastructure spending, and i think that's - could be a big opportunity for the next couple years. and i also think there's opportunity on drug pricing - that the president probably has some opinions that are more in line with democrat thinking on that issue as well. of course, though, the white house leg affairs team is going to be handling a lot of subpoenas for information or inquiries for investigations. and against that backdrop will be, what do democrats in the house decide to do regarding investigations or potential impeachment hearings? and how does that impact the legislative agenda, too?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: but let's talk about how the trump commission deals with its own caucus, the republicans, at the moment. because, as you just pointed out, there are issues on which the president says that he has more affinity with the democrats' perspective than with a number of the republican conservatives, for example - the sort of people who see themselves primarily as conservatives. they don't like those big stimulus packages. they don't want to see changes in the trade agreement with mexico and canada. so how do you deal with them?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "short: so i think they're each a little bit different. let's talk infrastructure for one second because i think, typically, republicans have talked a good game about being concerned about spending, and we have a debt that's now over $21 trillion. but, in reality, when push comes to shove, republicans haven't shown much more willingness to stop spending than democrats have. and so when you have an infrastructure spending bill that actually would provide resources back to their home state, i think you could see an avenue where republicans work with the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keep in mind as well that the president, i think, has more leverage now over the senate because, in many cases, those members who won in this midterm cycle, i think, owe a lot of that victory to the president. and some of the president's biggest opponents among the republicans in the senate, whether or not it's the passing of john mccain and the retirement of bob corker, retirement of jeff flake, means he has a republican conference that's more in line. so i think he has more leeway to say, hey, look - i've helped you. i need your help on this infrastructure package.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and what about on big issues where the parties really do have very different philosophies about the way forward? i'm thinking about immigration. how do you navigate something like that? or do they just say that, the next two years, nothing's going to happen? it's all going to be...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: ...executive orders and the courts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "short: i wouldn't say that. but i do have a caution there as far as optimism because i think that the immigration issue is one that certainly has pulled our two parties apart. and, big picture, i think there's an opportunity to say, i'll give you more leniency on giving a pathway to citizenship or guest worker programs if you give me border security, and everybody can talk about that. but when push comes to shove, and you get down in the details, the politics of each party begin to pull that apart.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cohn: definitely. you know, when i started writing on health care, you know, back in the late 1990s and coming to this and seeing all the problems of our health care system, you know, of course, your mind starts to think, well, what kind of system should we have? and if you care about universal health care, if you think health care should be a right like it is in the rest of the world, you think, well, we need a system like that. and so your standard is getting to that system, some kind of national health insurance system where everybody is covered and no one really faces the prospect of financial hardship because they've gotten sick.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then, you know, i had a chance to actually watch the political process chew over this and see in real time how the idea of universal coverage gets translated into a proposal that then becomes a series of bills that then go through congress that get signed and is being implemented and fighting resistance efforts at repeal. and, yeah, you get an appreciation for how hard this is. i mean, any kind of large-scale public policy reform is difficult. health care reform is especially difficult. and i think it did give me some appreciation for the importance of partial success and partial victories, even when they don't accomplish everything you might want and even when there are big parts of them that you think, gosh, that's regrettable; i wish this looked different.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cohn: you know, i thought so many times the republicans were done with fighting obamacare and then proven wrong. i hate to say anything definitively. but it is very clear in the last two elections - the 2018 midterms to 2020 presidential election - republicans did not emphasize obamacare repeal and, in fact, did their best to convince people that they were not trying to take away protections for preexisting conditions, that they were not trying to take away medicaid coverage i think because they learned after trying to repeal it and then the 2018 midterms that that is extremely unpopular, that the public does not want to give up what they got with the affordable care act. and so i think republicans are now much more reluctant to make a sort of frontal assault on it, which doesn't mean they don't think about health care.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cohn: so on day 1, the biden administration got to work undoing changes that the trump administration had made to the affordable care act. you know, the republican effort at repeal failed, but the trump administration was very good at finding small, technical ways of changing the law so that, for example, the financial assistance that people got buying insurance was lower. and this involves things like adjusting the formula for actuarial value. and just sort of saying that phrase i think puts people to sleep, but it's important. and there are, you know, a dozen or so of these changes that the trump administration made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and on day 1, basically, the biden administration came in and said, we're going to reverse these. we're going to change these. and actually, we're going to turn those dials back, and we're going to do things like fund outreach. so that's already underway. and that can all be done mostly through just pure executive authority. that's just changing regulations. it takes some time to do, but they don't need congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing, and this is part of - you know, there's a bill, the covid relief bill, moving through congress right now, the big one with the checks for people and the assistance for vaccinations. inside that bill is a boost to the subsidies for people who are buying insurance at healthcare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges like covered california.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is something that the architects of the law always wanted to do but never had the power to do because i think they recognized early on the bill was underfunded, and there's just not enough assistance for people. people need more help buying insurance. so there would be more money for people who get subsidies now, and more people would become eligible for subsidies. people who make a little too much money to qualify for assistance now - they would get help, too. so that is in the bill. it's only temporary. that's the asterisk there. it's a two-year bump. so even if it becomes law, if they want to make that permanent, they would have to come back and extend it. but those are two very concrete steps that are now already in motion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: does biden have other plans to try to expand the aca?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: well, you know, in his campaign, he talked about adding a public option. and people who remember the original debate about the affordable care act remember this was a very big part of the original proposal and was a bit of a compromise to please progressives who, remember; for all - historically had always wanted something like, you know, what we call medicare for all, a single-payer system, the government insuring everybody. well, that wasn't in the cards politically.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the idea was to have a sort of optional government-run program for people who want to go into it and that this program would, you know, would work like medicare works and, because of that, you know, in principle, in theory, would be more efficient. it would be cheaper. so it'd be a cheaper option for people. and, also, it would, you know, introduce some new competition - right? - for the private sector 'cause if you're a private insurer and you're competing with this public insurance option that's cheaper, you're going to lower your rates, too. that did not make it into the bill. it is not part of the law. biden has said he wants to have one of those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and interestingly, and this is important, it's an actually more ambitious version than the original in the sense that it would be open to anybody, even people who have employer insurance right now. he would basically say, if you want, you can jump over to that public option. and for that matter, you can also jump over to a private insurance plan that's subsidized through healthcare.gov if that's a better deal for you. and together, those two changes - that actually could deliver a lot of price relief. in other words, people would see - would be able to save money on their premiums for people who now have employer policies that are starting to get expensive and they're sweating out the premiums. so that could be a pretty big difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so this is a pretty broad question, but why did republicans make health care coverage, government health care coverage such a big target? i mean, everybody wants health care. of course, some people prefer to do it through private insurance, through employer insurance. but what were some of the motivations behind such strong republican opposition? and, you know, how much of it do you think was ideological - you know, a belief that government should not be funding this? how much of it do you think was, like, you know, budget hawks saying, we just can't afford to spend this; it's a bad idea; we're going to go into debt? and how much of it was money, like lobbyists who, you know, support republicans who didn't want the aca to pass and threatened to withdraw their funding?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: let's start with the philosophy. i think philosophical differences are a big part of it. i mean, ever since we've been debating universal health care, conservatives have - in this country have fought it. and it makes sense given, you know, conservative views in this country. i mean, what don't conservatives - what does universal health care require? well, it requires government spending. it requires either having the government displace the private insurance industry or regulate it very closely. and, of course, it was going to require finding new money to fund this through taxes. well, conservatives - they don't like taxes. they don't like regulation. they don't like government spending. they don't like having the public sector do what the private sector could do. so you're going to always run into some resistance in this country up against conservatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "having said that, there was certainly a period not that long ago when you had a significant number of republicans who, although generally, you know, they don't like taxes, they don't like regulation, nevertheless bought into the idea that we should have some kind of universal coverage system and really focus on, ok, well, how can we do this in a way that kind of fits what we prefer about how the world works? so maybe we do it through private insurance instead of public insurance. and we do - we don't make it so generous so it doesn't cost so much money. and you kind of go down the list.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, what was interesting was the premise of the affordable care act when they kind of got - when the democrats got power was they hoped that they crafted a plan that they thought had a lot of those elements and that looked like things conservatives had praised before in the hopes that that would get at least some republican buy-in. and, of course, it didn't. and i think that's where you get into the other factors at play. some of this was the republican party, the conservative movement in this country became more extreme in its opposition to the welfare state. and, you know, and this was a sort of ongoing change. a lot of this - you know, and then amplified by groups funded by the koch brothers, for example.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then some of this was, frankly, just about opposing the democrats, opposing obama. and, you know, that's a whole other conversation - well, why was the opposition to obama so intense? - and something i try to talk about in the book. but i always say, you know, i'm not surprised that republicans generally opposed, you know, the affordable care act. i'm surprised they all did. i'm surprised they did so intensely. and it's just hard to escape the idea that the opposition to obamacare was as much about the obama part as it was about the care part.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cohn: a pandemic really holds up a mirror to our health care system. and so, you know, one way to look at it is we still have millions of people uninsured. we have people with insurance with really big deductibles, can't get to the doctor. so, you know, in one way, you could say, gee, this shows all the inadequacies of the affordable care act. the flip side is if you imagine a world where we don't have the affordable care act in place, there would be so many more people who didn't have health insurance. there would be so many more people with insurance that had, you know, high deductibles, couldn't get to a doctor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, it's kind of remarkable we don't have - you know, it takes a while to get really good statistics on insurance coverage. it doesn't - it looks like the number of people without insurance has not dramatically increased, which is pretty remarkable given the number of people who have lost their jobs. so that's a pretty clear sign that the affordable care act is doing its job. there's a lot more to be done. but it's working, you know, like it's supposed to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so another example of how it's an imperfect plan, but it's better than not having it, in your opinion?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so there are certain weaknesses in the aca. can you give an example of something that you think is a weakness that is a result of a compromise that had to be made in order to get the bill passed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: yeah. i mean, i think the most obvious one is the amount of money that went into the funding, the overall funding of the health care legislation. when they were debating this, there was a commitment that outlays, you know, the sort of amount money you spend that the congressional budget office measured. it couldn't be more than a trillion dollars over 10 years. and there's no magical economic value to a trillion dollars. that's just - that's where, basically, it was thought to be politically sellable. as the debate went on, there was just a lot of pressure to hold that number down, mostly from more conservative democrats, partly because they'd also - they had said they were going to be fiscally responsible. they weren't going to spend money they didn't have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so every dollar they were going to spend, they had to find somewhere else. it had to be new taxes, or it had to come out of the pockets of the drug makers or the hospitals. the problem is, if you only spend - if you can't spend more than a trillion dollars over 10 years, you end up in a situation where you're spending less now to help people buy insurance. and so that's why today, especially when you get into the middle-class people who are buying insurance on their own, you have a lot of people who are looking at very high premiums, really big deductibles. and, yeah, they have insurance. yes, this is better than not having insurance. but, boy, it's a lot of money. it's not very affordable. and - you know, and that is why - one of the big reasons we're still here 10 years later saying, what do we need to do to fix our health care system?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the architects of the legislation, they felt like they had structured it in a way that basically, you know, the money was siphoned off. and, you know, money that came from the government couldn't be used to actually pay for abortion. but a group of democratic house members said, no, that wasn't good enough. and she basically had to say, fine. we'll give you this restriction that threatened to make abortion very unavailable for people buying private insurance. she did not want to do it. some of her closest allies did not want to do it. but she basically said to them, we have to make this deal because if we don't, this bill doesn't pass.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so with the drug industry, the original idea was they wanted - there's a whole series of things they wanted to do. they wanted to spend less on drugs through medicare and medicaid. and there was talk of - you know, there was talk of having the government start to negotiate prices directly with the drug companies, which is something that happens in other places in the world. and the drug industry basically came back and said, look, we will - we're ok with you paying us less somewhat through medicare and medicaid, but we're not going to accept the kind of reductions you want. and by the way, no way we're going to accept government negotiation of prices. if you do that, we're done. and not only are we done, but you can look forward to us using our war chest to finance advertisements against this legislation. and we'll tell every senator and congressman who listens to us - which is, by the way, most of congress - to oppose this bill. and your bill will be dead just as surely as the past ones were.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cohn: so i think it functions badly. and i think a fair amount of that is the way the sort of institutions of our government, especially the congress, especially the senate, are set up really thwart change and thwart progressive change in particular. and that is because of the sort of bias towards small states that's built into the way the senate is designed. you know, a senator from wyoming has the same amount of influence as a senator from new york. and because of the way the country's population is distributed, that pulls everything in a much more conservative direction. you throw the filibuster on that - so you actually need 60 votes, not 50, to pass something - and it's just very hard to do anything. and, you know, i think going forward, that's why i think progressives, if you're thinking about the future, how to pass reforms, they really need to attack those impediments to change or otherwise they're going to run into the same struggles that the democrats of 2009 did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so the republicans had stood for repeal and replace. the replacement part never really got drafted even though president trump had kept promising it's coming soon, a couple of weeks. it never materialized. do you think that the explanation you just gave of republicans becoming better at generating outrage than generating legislation and really knowing the art of legislation, do you think that explains in part why replace never got formulated?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: i think that's a really big part of it. you know, i - by comparison, i compare the years leading up to the affordable care act's enactment to the years leading up to the attempt to repeal. and when you look at how - why did democrats get their legislation across the line? well, a big reason was they spent 10, 15 years looking at where they had failed in the past and having these very complex, difficult debates internally about how to design a plan that would work, that could - they could sell politically, that they could get through congress. so they were really ready. they'd done a ton of homework by the time, you know, 2009 comes around and they have the ability to actually pass legislation. you compare that to the republicans. you know, in the period between 2010 and 2017, they had seven years really to do that, to sort of go through the same process, to really kind of say, all right, what does our replacement look like? how do we pass it? and, you know, health care is hard, right?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so a lot of people are pushing for universal health care. and some people see the aca as a step in that direction, and i think others see it as a bureaucracy that takes us in a way further away from universal health care. and of course, some people don't want universal health care because it's more government interference in health care. but do you think that the u.s. will ever have universal health care?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: i do think we'll get there eventually. i think it will take time. you know, the people who wrote the affordable care act, certainly were trying to get to universal health care. that's what they believed. and i think they would see and i would agree that it's a big step on the road towards universal health care, both in the sense that we've covered many more people. so the number of people who don't have insurance at this point is much lower than it was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but also, we've really established some of the key principles. they're sort of widely accepted politically. again, you know, you just see that in the fact that republicans these days, who are the opponents of obamacare, nevertheless say but, you know, just to be clear, we think everybody should have a right to insurance regardless of preexisting condition. well, that was not a reality 10 - more than 10 years ago. so that has changed. so we've gotten closer clearly. you know, how we get the rest of the way, you know, to what extent it involves building on the architecture of the affordable care act versus tearing that architecture down, putting something new in its place, i think that is the debate going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: you've been writing about health care coverage and health care, you know, policy for basically your whole adult life. what's kept you doing that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: well, you know, i would say two things. first of all, the problem never gets solved. so there is always, you know, it's an ongoing effort to sort of figure out what to do about it and to understand it. it's such a complex system. i mean, i have been writing about health care for a long time, but i learn new things every day. there are vast swaths of our health care universe i don't understand and i'm still trying to learn. and of course, conditions change. and sometimes, you know, you need to write about the changes and figure out, ok, what's new now? how do we need to rethink what we thought before?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the other reason is, you know, i'm a - you know, having spent so much time over the years talking to people who have struggled with medical bills, who've gone through real hardship. and it hits you every time that it's not that these people have made all the right decisions necessarily, it's not that they've always put themselves in the best positions, but the end of the day, they're - people, you know, are unlucky and they suffer because of it. and, you know, i - you know, i'm not afraid to sort of say that. i think just as a moral principle, if you're facing an injury or a serious illness, you shouldn't also have to worry about paying your bills. it's bad enough to have to worry about the illness or the injury. that's hard. anyone who's ever been through that, anyone who's been - had a family member go through that, it can be incredibly traumatic. it's difficult. it's hard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the least a society can do is to say we may not be able to cure you, we may not be able to make you better, but the very least we're going to make sure that, you know, you don't have to worry about going bankrupt, paying your bills. and we don't do that as a society. now, other societies do that. and, you know, until we get to that point, i imagine i'll keep writing about this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: your mother died after a long illness. she was in a nursing home. and she died during the covid pandemic, so you were not able to be with her or to visit her. i'm very sorry for your loss. so - but i'm going to ask you a more technical question here. i don't know how much you had to deal with her bills and with the nursing home doctors and nurses. it's so hard when you have somebody who you care about and you can't see them and they're in a hospital or a nursing home. what did you learn about our health care system from the period when you were able to visit her and then in covid when you couldn't?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: yeah. well, thank you for the sympathy. i learned a lot. you know, as someone who writes about health care, to be on the other end of it, sort of experiencing this and navigating this and trying to navigate the health care system - in that case, this is, you know, the technical term for nursing home care, assisted living, that's all called long-term care. and it's a real mess. it has - every problem of our health care system is exists in the long-term care system and it's worse. it's hard to figure out who pays what bill. you're constantly dealing with the networks. you think your insurance covers something, and then you discover that it doesn't. and you have to get on the phone and fight. and the amount of time you spend on this, you know, which is time you want to be spending with your loved one - and, you know, these are - you know, and anyone who's gone through this particular experience knows this is incredibly hard. you have some incredibly difficult decisions you have to make. you're constantly second guessing. and again, having to sort of spend your time, your emotional energy, dealing with insurance bureaucracies, dealing with all these payment questions. it's just - it makes it such a greater burden at a time when, even under the best of circumstances, it's an incredible burden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: another issue related to nursing homes and to hospital care and to home health care is that a lot of the nurses and home health care workers, i think, are really underpaid. and i think it's a weakness in the system. we expect, we demand so much of them. and some of them are making so little in return. and i think it sometimes shows up in the care that you get.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: unquestionably. people who provide direct care, that is such a hard job. it requires a combination of skills that you learn and talent that some people have. and they're paid ridiculously low, frequently without benefits. the facilities themselves are frequently understaffed. you know, it was - it's been heartbreaking to me during the pandemic to see how many, not just residents of long-term care facilities were suffering, but staff, who, you know, especially, you know, obviously, at the beginning, they didn't have enough protective gear. some of them still don't have enough protective gear but were being asked to bear such a burden, you know, both taking care of these people who lived in these facilities and also, frankly, provide a lot of the emotional support for families like mine that couldn't be there physically.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "absolutely, they need to be paid more. you know, this is - you know, but if you look at it as a policy problem, you will quickly discover that, you know, this is one - this is a hard problem to solve because there's exactly one way you solve it, and that's you spend more money on it. you know, we need to spend more money on long-term care. this is something in this country we've never done. there's a whole complex set of reasons for that, a lot of it tied to who the people are who traditionally do this work, the fact that it's people who are easily discriminated against. but, yeah, we need to pay these people more. we need to pay these people a lot more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: lately, you've been covering the pandemic. what are some of the changes the biden administration has been making or plans to make regarding the pandemic?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cohn: yeah. so there's no one silver bullet. i mean, really, what they've done is they've sort of come up with a list of all the little things you need to do to improve vaccine distribution. and they are basically working on all of them. so - you know, they run the gamut. i mean, we're seeing them set up these mass vaccination clinics, for example, big parking lots and stadiums. we're also seeing them pay attention to supplies for the vaccine makers, making sure that the vaccine - you know, vaccine production is very difficult. it requires certain kind of machines. it requires certain raw materials. and so they're using what's known as the defense production act to make sure that the supply orders have priority. they're trying to do a much better job of communicating with the state, saying, look, this - you can count on getting x vaccines for the next three weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's a big deal because a lot of the problems we're seeing in terms of being able to get shots, not people get shots, is that there's just - there's a lot of miscommunication between the states and the local departments and the hospitals. and that comes from the fact that the states are not sure what they're getting a week from now. so it's hard to make plans. so they're working on all of these things. they're also paying a lot of attention to equity. you know, they're making - you know, it's not just how quickly shots are getting into arms. but are they going into everybody's arms? in particular, are they going to the sort of people who are most at risk? i mean, it's sort of - it's sad. but, you know, in general, higher income groups are doing a much better job of getting shots than lower income groups. but lower income groups, in general, they're the essential workers. they're the ones in overcrowded housing. they're at the greatest risk. so the biden administration is trying to do something about that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ron elving, byline: this goes back to changes to the budget process that were made in the 1970s that made it really necessary for the president and congress to work together in certain ways. and here's a news flash. sometimes they don't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: there were three short shutdowns while ronald reagan was president and another short one under george h.w. bush.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "elving: in november of that year and again in december and january, congress sent bills to the president, daring him to veto them. he did, and that meant no new appropriations were made. and that meant all non-emergency functions of the government started shutting down.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kelly: to be clear, the military does not shut down. air traffic controllers still have to show up at work. what does it actually mean...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: tsa still looks at your bags and so on. much of the shutdown disruption applies to things that are not emergencies. but we do talk these days about 800,000 immediate furloughs in the federal government. more than a million other federal employees are told to show up with no idea when they're going to be paid. as a result, the federal government does not function well in anything other than the emergency processes. but it should be made clear, it's not as though the military is suddenly going to go on furlough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kelly: and does this actually save money?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: it does not because in the long run, all the same work has to be done, and all the same paychecks are always issued. and so in the end, it costs money because there are shutdown and restart costs. the frictional costs of these shutdowns are actually quite substantial - tens of millions of dollars at least. and as a result, they actually lose money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kelly: do they actually accomplish anything?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "two years later, what has his administration done to change the aca, and who's been affected? below are five of the biggest changes to the federal health law under president trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is it? the individual mandate is the requirement that all u.s. residents either have health insurance or pay a penalty. the mandate was intended to help keep the premiums for aca policies low by ensuring that more healthy people entered the health insurance market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what changed? the 2017 republican-backed tax overhaul legislation reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does the administration say? we eliminated obamacare's horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate. a total disaster. that was a big penalty. that was a big thing. where you paid a lot of money for the privilege [...] of having no healthcare. — president trump, the villages, florida, oct. 3, 2019", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's the impact? first of all, getting rid of the penalty for skipping insurance opened a new avenue of attack against the entire aca in the courts, via the texas v. azar lawsuit. back in 2012, the aca had been upheld as constitutional by the u.s. supreme court, because the penalty was essentially a tax, and congress is allowed to create a new tax. last december, though, a federal judge in texas ruled that now that the penalty is $0, it's a command, not a tax, and is therefore unconstitutional. he also reasoned that it cannot be cut off from the rest of the law, so he judged the whole law to be unconstitutional. a decision from the appeals court is expected any day now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "eliminating the penalty also caused insurance premiums to rise, says sabrina corlette, director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university. insurance companies were getting very strong signals from the trump administration that even if the aca wasn't repealed, the trump administration probably was not going to enforce the individual mandate, she says. insurance companies figured that without a financial penalty, healthy people would opt not to buy insurance, and the pool of those that remained would be smaller and sicker.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, even though the $0 penalty didn't actually go into effect until 2019, corlette says, insurance companies — in anticipation of the individual mandate going away and in anticipation that consumers would believe that the individual mandate was no longer going to be enforced — priced for that for 2018. according to the kaiser family foundation, premiums went up about 32%, on average, for aca silver plans that went into effect in early 2018, although most people received subsidies to offset those premium hikes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. states allowed to add work requirements to medicaid", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is it? medicaid expansion was a key part of the aca. the federal government helped pay for states (that chose to) to expand medicaid eligibility beyond families to include all low-income adults, and to raise the income threshold, so that more people would be eligible. so far, 37 states and washington have opted to expand medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what changed? under trump, if they get approval from the federal government, states can now require medicaid beneficiaries to prove with documentation that they either work or go to school.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does the administration say? when you consider that, less than five years ago, medicaid was expanded to nearly 15 million new working-age adults, it's fair that states want to add community engagement requirements for those with the ability to meet them. it's easier to give someone a card; it's much harder to build a ladder to help people climb their way out of poverty. but even though it is harder, it's the right thing to do. — seema verma, administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, washington, sept. 27, 2018", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's the impact? even though healthcare.gov and the state insurance exchanges get a lot of attention, the majority of people who gained health care coverage after the passage of the aca — 12.7 million people — actually got their coverage by being newly able to enroll in medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "medicaid expansion has proven to be quite popular. and in the 2018 election, three more red states — idaho, nebraska and utah — voted to join in. right now, 18 states have applied to the federal government to implement work requirements; but most such programs haven't yet gone into effect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the one work requirement program that's actually gone into effect is in arkansas, says nicholas bagley, professor of law at the university of michigan and a close follower of the aca. we now have good data indicating that tens of thousands of people were kicked off of medicaid, not because they were ineligible under the work requirement program, but because they had trouble actually following through on the reporting requirements — dealing with websites, trying to figure out how to report hours effectively, and all the rest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if more states are able to implement work requirements, bagley says, that could lead to the loss of coverage for tens of thousands — or even hundreds of thousands — of people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cms administrator verma has pushed back on the idea that these requirements are some subversive attempt to just kick people off of medicaid. instead, she says, their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier, independent lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "work requirements in arkansas and kentucky were put on hold by a federal judge in march, and those cases are on appeal. the issue is likely headed to the supreme court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers have ended", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is it? payments from the federal government to insurers to motivate them to stay in the aca insurance exchanges and help keep premiums down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what changed? the trump administration suddenly stopped paying these subsidies in 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does the administration say? i knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians. ... this is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. and they've had a record run. they've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate. — president trump, the white house, oct 17, 2017", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's the impact? this change had a strange and unexpected impact on the new insurance markets set up by the aca. insurers were in a bind: they had to offer subsidies to low-income people applying for insurance, but the federal government was no longer reimbursing them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first thinking [was], 'oh gosh, that's going to cause premiums to go up, and it's going to hurt the marketplace,'  says christine eibner, who tracks the aca at the nonpartisan rand corporation. what ended up happening is, insurers, by and large, addressed this by increasing the price of the silver plan on the health insurance exchanges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this pricing strategy was nicknamed silver loading. because the silver plan is the one used to calculate tax credits, the trump administration still ended up paying to subsidize people's premiums, but in a different way. in fact, it has probably led to an increase in federal spending to help people afford marketplace premiums, eibner says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where the real damage has been done is for folks who aren't eligible for subsidies — who are making just a little bit too much for those subsidies, corlette adds. they really are priced out of comprehensive aca-compliant insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. access to short-term skinny plans has been expanded", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is it? the aca initially established rules that health plans sold on healthcare.gov and state exchanges had to cover people with preexisting conditions and had to provide certain essential benefits. president obama limited any short-term insurance policies that did not provide those benefits to a maximum duration of three months. (the original idea of these policies is that they can serve as a helpful bridge for people between school and a job, for example.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what changed? the trump administration issued a rule last year that allowed these short-term plans to last 364 days and to be renewable for three years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does the administration say? we took swift action to open short-term health plans and association health plans to millions and millions of americans. many of these options are already reducing the cost of health insurance premiums by up to 60% and, really, more than that. — president trump, the white house, june 14, 2019", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's the impact? the new rule went into effect last october, though availability of these short-term or skinny plans varies depending on where you live — some states have passed their own laws that either limit or expand access to them. some federal actuaries projected lots of people would leave aca marketplaces to get these cheaper plans; they said that would likely increase the size of premiums paid by people who buy more comprehensive coverage on the aca exchanges. but a recent analysis from the kaiser family foundation finds that the aca marketplaces have actually stayed pretty stable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, there's another consequence of expanding access to these less comprehensive plans: people who get these skinny plans aren't really fully protected in the event that they have a serious health condition and need to use their insurance, eibner says. they may find that it doesn't cover everything that they would have been covered for under an aca-compliant plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for instance, you might pay only $70 a month in premiums but have a deductible that's $12,500 — so if you get really sick or get into an accident, you could be in serious financial straits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. funds to facilitate healthcare.gov sign-ups slashed", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is it? the aca created navigator programs and an advertising budget to help people figure out specifics of the new federally run insurance exchanges and sign up for coverage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what changed? in august 2017, the administration significantly cut federal funding for these programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does the administration say? it's time for the navigator program to evolve. ... this decision reflects cms' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated exchanges to their most cost effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process. — cms administrator seema verma, written statement, july 10, 2018", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's the impact? it's hard to document what the impact of this particular cut was on enrollment. the cuts were uneven, and some states and cities got creative to keep providing services. we have seen erosion in overall health insurance coverage, corlette says. but it's hard to know whether that's the effect of the individual mandate going away, the short-term plans or the reductions in marketing and outreach — it's really hard to tease out the impact of those three changes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "overall, nicholas bagley says, the aca has been pretty resilient to everything, so far, that the trump administration has thrown at it. some of trump's efforts to hobble the law have been caught up in the courts; others have not gone into effect. and despite efforts to lure people away from the individual insurance marketplaces or to make aca policies unaffordable, the marketplaces have proved themselves to be remarkably resilient, corlette says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "abbe gluck, director of the solomon center for health law and policy at yale, cautions that though the law has proven to be stronger than expected, all these actions by the trump administration have, indeed, had an effect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these actions have been designed to depress enrollment — they have depressed enrollment, she says. they have increased insurance prices. also, the uninsured rate for u.s. residents also went up in 2018 for the first time since before the aca was passed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "despite that, one of the things that has kept the marketplaces as strong as they are, gluck notes, is that they're not all run by the federal government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "since the affordable care act is implemented half by state governments — mostly blue states — those state governments have been able to resist these sabotaging efforts, gluck says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they have been able to extend enrollment, and they have been able to do outreach, because they run their own insurance markets. and in those states there is already evidence that sabotage attacks have not been felt as strongly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the piecemeal attacks on the aca have made many people nervous about the future of their health coverage, gluck says. the most important theme of [trump's] administration of the aca has been to sow uncertainty into the market and destabilize the insurance pool, she says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with open enrollment for 2020 health plans set to kick off in just a few weeks, bagley wants people to know the aca is still strong.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the trump administration wants to dramatically alter the way the federal government gives money to states for medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on thursday, seema verma, the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, announced a new pathway for states to receive a capped amount of federal dollars for part of the program. the new demonstration program, called healthy adult opportunity, would not be mandatory for states and would not affect all medicaid beneficiaries, only adults under age 65 who are not disabled.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but for states that adopt the new approach, it could profoundly reshape how medicaid operates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "medicaid covers health care for 71 million people across the country — most are low-income people, disabled people, and children. it's set up as a federal-state partnership — a state contributes money to cover its medicaid population, and the federal government matches that contribution using a formula based on a state's per capita income. therefore, low-income states get more from the federal government than high-income states do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is currently no limit to what the federal government contributes — medicaid beneficiaries across the country have a right to whatever care they need for however long they need it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with the announcement, cms is inviting states to design medicaid plans that work with a new capped-funding approach; they have flexibility in how they design these plans and could be exempted from certain medicaid requirements. for example, the plan would allow states to create a formulary to pick and choose which drugs are covered — normally medicaid covers all drugs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in her remarks, verma anticipated critics who might consider this an attack on the safety net. she spoke passionately about the purpose of medicaid, calling it a lifeline for millions of americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but she justified the new approach as a means to ensure financial sustainability for the program in the long term by letting states operate with a defined budget. this has historically been called a block grant, but verma was careful not to mention those words in her remarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the healthy adult opportunity represents an innovative and historic approach to surmounting medicaid's structural challenges, she said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with this announcement, the trump administration is delivering on a longtime conservative ideal — block grants for medicaid have been discussed for nearly as long as medicaid has existed, going back to the nixon administration. every time, either congress or the white house has declined to take the plunge, and medicaid has remained open-ended.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when enrollment goes up or during an economic downturn or the cost of prescription drugs go up, it costs the states more money to finance their programs, but the federal government matches those dollars to states, said robin rudowitz, vice president of the kaiser family foundation and co-director of the foundation's program on medicaid and the uninsured.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "whether thursday's announcement will upend that system depends on what states do with the new guidance. states will have to ask cms for a waiver and wait for approval. it's usually a lengthy process, although on thursday, verma indicated the agency would be attempting to streamline things by creating a template application. most likely, it will be months before this plan could go into effect in a state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's also a question about whether this would be legal. another major initiative from verma to transform medicaid was permission for states to get a waiver to make work requirements part of the program. that effort has been blocked in the courts and is currently on appeal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one the few states that put into effect a work requirement — a requirement for some beneficiaries to report that they are working, going to school or doing community service — was arkansas, and one analysis found thousands of people lost their health coverage as a result.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that has created the legal challenge for the government. the legal argument against them, which has made headway in courts, is that work requirements fail to promote the objectives of the medicaid program, which is primarily to provide affordable health coverage to low income people, said rudowitz.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "oklahoma gov. kevin stitt joined verma at thursday's announcement, calling the new approach to medicaid a game-changer. he said his state hopes to be among the first in the nation to apply for the waiver. stitt, a republican, is promoting his medicaid plan as an alternative to a measure on the ballot in the upcoming election to expand medicaid in his state, a move he said would be wrong and will be ineffective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he said the waiver would allow the state to innovate, including finding new ways to contain costs and adding premiums and work requirements to the plan for adults. he said his approach will create expectations for able-bodied individuals to see this as a true trampoline to their future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this move is geared toward red-state governors like stitt, said jamila michener, an assistant professor of government at cornell university. they can't outright support medicaid expansion or support obamacare, also known as the affordable care act, she said. work requirements were a way for them to kind of help save face, to expand medicaid, but still be able to make it appear as though they were remaining true to their conservative bona fides. now that work requirements are tied up in litigation, this presents another way to accomplish a similar political goal, she says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "past efforts through the decades to institute block grants in medicaid have come through congress and would have changed medicaid in all states at once — most recently in 2017 as part of the plan to repeal and replace obamacare. since states will have to apply for the healthy adult opportunity waiver, this won't change medicaid in many states that don't opt in. (washington gov. jay inslee, for one, tweeted, hard pass.)", "augmented": []}

[they're] placing a fiscal straitjacket on themselves that will only lead to eventual cuts to their programs and harmful effects to their budgets, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's a political risk for the trump administration as well. polling suggests that medicaid is very popular and that capping federal spending in the program is not. medicaid is more popular than it has ever been because people understand that if it's not their immediate family, their kids, it's their parents, it's neighbors and others who rely on the program, park adds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "michener pointed out the wonkiness of this move might insulate it from the disapproval of voters in an election year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if there's a way to get at medicaid, which is what this administration [has been] trying to do the entire time, then this is the way, she said. and it helps, she adds, that the trump administration can make this change on its own: you don't have to fight congress — like you did with repeal and replace — and lose in the end.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in a way, he's sort of calling people's bluff. this was a strategy that a lot of republicans had supported in the beginning of the year. they eventually decided that was not a good idea, to take away health care and not be able to illuminate what you would - could replace it with. i think it's more of a political move than a policy one. but it'll be interesting to see where the votes fall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: but that's important here. so you're saying there is even some uncertainty in that - that he could muster enough votes to just do a straight-up repeal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: absolutely because if you're saying, this is going to be the first vote we have, there's - remember, you know, that's a move to appeal to a lot of conservatives. but a lot of moderate republicans, like susan collins of maine, a senator we've heard a lot about in the recent weeks, are unlikely to get behind that strategy. so again, there is really no one plan that can get 50 senators on board.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: how bad is this in terms of a setback for the entire republican agenda?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: you know, we don't know for sure. but i can tell you what republicans have told me repeatedly in recent weeks, that they saw failure here as potentially devastating to the rest of the republican agenda in terms of getting tax reform done, which is arguably a bigger priority for many in the party than health care - in terms of getting an infrastructure bill done or moving any big legislative lifts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you can't do the one thing that, in theory, unified the entire party, how can you do even harder things? i think there's a fear that failure here will be sort of internally corrosive, will prompt some element of party infighting and that - i think it also shows there's still a lot of distance and potentially some distrust between republicans in congress and their president in the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: so let me ask - let me just ask you a broad question here. matthew continetti - he's a conservative writer, the editor of the washington free beacon. he was on our show this morning. he said that health care is not the republicans' issue. i asked him, do you mean that americans shouldn't trust republicans on health care? he said, no, no, no, just politically, it's a bad issue. do you hear that from republicans?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: you know, i do. i mean, health care is an issue i don't think is in the marrow of the republican party's bones in the same way it is for the democratic party. and also, you know, fundamentally, if you think of the way these debates were framed, the affordable care act was about giving people something. and this republican health care bill was about taking something away. and that's always going to be a more difficult sell to the american electorate when they perceive that their government is taking something from them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: so what does this latest collapse mean for the health care industry?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: well, the health care industry, and particularly insurance companies, will be looking intently at how the trump administration reacts to this. the affordable care act is still the law of the land. insurers have to set premiums for 2018 and decide whether they're going to participate in the insurance marketplaces. and they're looking and reading the tea leaves to see what the trump administration is going to do following this failure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok. so before we even get to the longer term prospects for obamacare, there's this real-time decision that insurance companies are making now about whether to participate in the health care market in - i don't know - idaho, kentucky. pick your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: absolutely. and there are two things in particular insurers are looking for. one is whether the administration will enforce the individual mandate. that's the stick that compels healthy and young people to sign up for insurance or pay a penalty. and then the second is whether the administration will pay what's known as cost-sharing subsidies. insurers under the law have to provide lower deductibles to low-income consumers. and these subsidies compensate insurers for that cost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the past, the president has threatened to withhold those subsidies, which are the subject of a lawsuit, to try and bring insurers to the table to negotiate a bill. well, there's not a bill to negotiate right now. and insurers, if they don't get that money, would have to raise premiums significantly, or might just pull out of the market altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok. so the administration can do things right now or not do things right now that could cause premiums to go up or could cause more or fewer choices for people in different insurance markets. you mentioned, though, that what the trump administration does is being closely watched. there is something that the guy at the top of the trump administration has already done. he has publicly said, as we heard david and sue discuss - he's publicly said, go ahead with repeal. just repeal it. work on replacement later.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, has effectively said they're going to try that. they're going to attempt that. what are the implications for the insurance market if that worked - if there's a straight repeal, if there's no replacement and a two-year deadline and congress says, we'll work something out over the next couple of years?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: there's an important fact to know about this repeal. it's not actually a full repeal because republicans can't do that under the budget rules they're operating in for this debate. so...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: oh, this is just a partial repeal at best. ok.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: this is a partial repeal. it repeals the subsidies that help people buy insurance. it repeals the medicaid expansion. it repeals all of the taxes. and it repeals the individual mandate, in fact, retroactively. what it doesn't do is repeal the requirement on insurers that they take everyone, including people with preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: meaning that over the next couple of years, insurers would still have to take anybody.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: exactly. insurers would have to take anyone. people would not get subsidies to help them buy insurance. and there would be no individual mandate to compel healthy people to sign up. so what the congressional budget office has said is that premiums would immediately go up 20 to 25 percent next year, and eventually double by 2026. and the number of people uninsured would rise by 18 million initially and eventually by 32 million.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: wait a minute. wait a minute. we're talking about they'll repeal with a two-year delay. are you saying even before the two-year period ended, that premiums would start soaring? that would be the practical effect here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: exactly - because the individual mandate would be repealed immediately. so insurers would have to take people with preexisting conditions. but the sense is healthy people without that mandate wouldn't sign up. so insurers, under that kind of uncertainty, would immediately raise premiums.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: stick with us for a moment, larry levitt, because i want to bring susan davis back into our conversation. she's been covering the politics of all this. and i'd like to know, sue - republicans have voted again and again and again for straight-up repeal - repeal of obamacare. they did it just a couple of years ago. how eager, actually, are republicans to just repeal obamacare?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: well, we may have - we may find out very soon. and it's not - i would not say it's the vast majority of republicans. they like the idea of repeal. but the reason why they scuttled this original plan back in january is they realized it was tremendously risky to repeal legislation and not be able to tell the public what you're going to do with it. and remember, congress does not do well when they say they're going to do things with big consequences.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davis: the last time they did this, they tried to get a budget deal. and it resulted in painful budget cuts known as the sequester.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: which they've hated ever since. larry levitt is still on the line. and let me ask about another option here, which mitch mcconnell has discussed. suppose, as mcconnell once said, republicans are finally forced to work with democrats, come up with some kind of bipartisan plan. and then we're talking about options that improve choices for people in the health insurance market, hopefully lead to cheaper premiums. what bipartisan options are out there, potentially?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: well, there are ideas that both democrats and republicans have talked about. one is providing insurance that these cost-sharing subsidies get paid to insurers. the other is pumping some money into the insurance market to help lower premiums and reduce the uncertainty insurers have in covering high-cost patients.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: wait a minute, paying more? because republicans are not going to like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "levitt: well, you know, interestingly enough, all of the republican bills included a substantial amount of money to funnel money to insurers to help bring premiums down. so there's at least some on-paper bipartisan support for that idea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: and then it just becomes a matter of getting the numbers - getting agreement on the numbers?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this year's medicare trustees report says the program would now be able to pay all its bills through 2028, a full 11 years longer than a 2009 forecast — an improvement medicare's trustees attribute, in part, to changes in medicare called for in the affordable care act and other economic factors.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ryan's plan would set up medicare exchanges where private insurance companies would compete with traditional government-run medicare for customers. obamacare exchanges sell only private insurance plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people would get premium support from the government to pay for their insurance under the ryan medicare plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the subsidy would be tied to the price of a specific plan offered by an insurer on the exchange, much like the affordable care act subsidy is tied to the second-cheapest silver plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the payment would be linked to a recipient's income, so lower-income people would get a bigger subsidy. the subsidy would rise as beneficiaries get sicker, to ensure access to insurance. as with obamacare, people who choose plans that cost more than the government subsidy would have to pay the balance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "insurers would have to agree to issue policies to any medicare beneficiary, to avoid cherry-picking, and to ensure that medicare's sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries receive coverage.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the real question here is whether the requisite safeguards are in place to ensure that the elderly and people with disabilities would be able to maneuver in such a system, he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's because the health care and health insurance systems are very complex. doctors move in and out of networks, copayments can vary and plans can change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "millions of people on medicare are also eligible for medicaid, meaning they are poor and vulnerable, aaron says. and at least 8 million social security beneficiaries have been declared financially incompetent and are assigned a representative to manage their money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what you've got here is a group of people who are very sick, poor, and often cognitively impaired one way or the other, aaron says. tossing people like that into a health care marketplace and saying, 'here, go buy some insurance,' is a recipe for problems.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "relative deprivation describes being deprived of something a person feels entitled to. for example, they used to have it, expected to have it, or see that others have it. the theory helps explain this political moment of anger in america — whether it's the rise in popularity of obamacare (in part because many on the left who didn't think it went far enough see the law threatened), why people are marching in the streets to protest the new president and even why trump won in the first place.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it is intended to roll back key elements of obama-era requirements, which were designed to promote enrollment in aca plans that cover a broad range of medical needs and meet uniform national standards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "seema verma, the centers for medicare & medicaid services administrator, said those strict rules were seen by many as burdensome, and virtually impossible for states to meet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "instead, the trump administration wants states to innovate in ways that could produce more lower-cost options, even if those alternatives do not provide the same level of financial or medical coverage as an aca plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm confident states will come up with ideas that will work better, said verma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, coupled with other ongoing efforts by the trump administration to gut obamacare, policy experts predict the ideas would further foster a parallel market of cheaper, less robust coverage that could draw younger or healthier consumers, but drive up premiums for those who remain in aca market plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "invariably, the coverage is going to be more expensive for people who really need comprehensive coverage, said timothy jost, a retired washington and lee university law professor who follows the aca closely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "states could change who gets subsidies", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the biggest changes signaled by the administration involves allowing states to revamp how federal subsidies are used. currently, these subsidies are strictly targeted to lower-income americans and are seen as key to bolstering enrollment in marketplace plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump guidance would give states wider latitude to expand or narrow the income range eligible for subsidies, target them toward younger people or allow them to be used for less costly but skimpier types of insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this would potentially upend the subsidy structure, said sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university's health policy institute.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another example would, for the first time, make federal subsidy money available to people who get job-based insurance, countering obama-era rules that generally prohibited that. it would let states use federal dollars to fund accounts consumers could use to buy insurance or pay other health costs, such as deductibles or copayments. employers or consumers could also add additional funds to these accounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, managing those accounts would be a large administrative expense for a state to oversee, said corlette. i don't understand why a state would want to set it up, she added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "supporters of trump's plan say the examples unveiled thursday would give consumers more control over how they choose to spend their health care dollars and the types of coverage they want to buy. they say it might also improve the markets, which are seeing declining enrollment as premiums rise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if states can provide larger subsidies to younger individuals to attract them to enroll, that will improve the market overall, said christopher condeluci, a washington, d.c., attorney who specializes in employee benefits and has served as the tax and benefits counsel to the u.s. senate finance committee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, if many states follow the administration's lead, critics say, it would bring back the days when insurance rules varied widely state by state. consumers could end up buying skimpier plans that leave them vulnerable to high, unexpected medical bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while not prescriptive, the examples are designed to encourage states to innovate and apply for permission to offer more choices for consumers, so long as the proposals don't cost taxpayers more and don't reduce access to aca plans, said verma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "state proposals would still have to be affordable, comprehensive and not raise the federal deficit, she said. and cms would pay particular attention to potential effects on low-income americans, she added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the administration's examples focus on states' health marketplaces, where insurance plans are designed for small businesses and for individuals who don't get job-based coverage. an estimated 14 million people buy their own coverage through those markets or through brokers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "premiums in those markets have risen substantially since the law took effect in 2014, for a variety of reasons. among those reasons are lower-than-expected enrollment by healthy people; actions taken by congress and the trump administration that removed the tax penalty for failing to have coverage; and other moves that eliminated some payments to insurers and loosened restrictions on alternative types of insurance plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the administration's examples add a new twist to a provision of the aca that gave states the option of seeking a federal waiver to develop alternative marketplace proposals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to get a waiver under obamacare rules, however, states have to meet four guardrails established in 2015. these require states to ensure their proposals would provide equally comprehensive and affordable coverage; would not result in fewer people enrolling; and wouldn't increase costs for taxpayers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the examples described thursday — touted as waiver concepts by the trump administration — build on the administration's guidance issued in late october to loosen those guardrails.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that october guidance, to take effect in 2020, says states have to provide access to affordable and comprehensive coverage, but will not be held to a strict tally of how many people actually enroll. so long as a state could show that equal numbers of people were buying some kind of coverage — either comprehensive aca plans or less expensive but skimpier plans — the state's approach could pass the test.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that october announcement, and thursday's concepts, drew immediate criticism from aca supporters, who said it encourages the use of subsidies to buy short-term plans, which aren't as comprehensive as aca coverage and can bar people who have preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "congressional democrats sent a letter to top administration officials this week, saying the process by which the changes are being made is illegal, because the administration is not following a formal rule-making process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we believe this sub-regulatory guidance exceeds the secretaries' statutory authority, wrote ways & means ranking member richard neal, d-mass., and energy and commerce ranking member frank pallone jr., d-n.j. it appears to be part of the administration's ideologically motivated efforts to sabotage the aca.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the brookings institution and other experts have raised similar questions and predicted a legal challenge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as soon as any state proceeds to go somewhere with this, there will be legal challenges, said jost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "verma pushed back against this warning, noting that the obama administration also issued its guardrails as guidance, not a formal rule.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "verma said she anticipated that critics would say the ideas would adversely affect people with preexisting medical conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those critics argue that anything that draws younger and healthier people out of the market will drive up costs for those who remain in aca plans — including those with medical conditions, who might be barred from buying an alternative policy, such as a short-term plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but verma said that nothing in this guidance would take away protections from people with preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "amid ethics office debacle, googling congress members spiked. sort of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "amid this week's firestorm over republicans' attempt to weaken the office of congressional ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the internet. it depicts data from google trends about americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. tuesday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the hill reported this on tuesday, with the the new york times later referencing the trend. the conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got congress members' attention. and, indeed, some congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all google trends data — the problem of scale. while there's a spike here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here, for example, is the who is my representative search compared to searches for obamacare in the u.s. over the past week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. tuesday, who is my representative registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for obamacare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but then, maybe that's not fair. obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. let's try a google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the really striking comparisons come when you compare this spike to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. how about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national tv?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ok, so the spike for mariah carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. it's true that google trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. for example, researchers reported in october that trump searches outstripped hillary clinton searches. they subsequently concluded that this could be evidence that mr. trump is doing better than the polls project.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. in fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random googling. as it turns out, searches for who is my representative are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so searches for who is my representative spiked, surpassing beanie baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "none of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did google their congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their congress members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it is to say that google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. yes, plenty of people were googling their congress members this week. but plenty more were watching that mariah video.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "could trump 'undermine the legacy of the obama presidency' with the stroke of a pen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. now that donald trump is starting to put together his administration, americans are wondering which of his provocative campaign proposals will he seriously pursue and which ones might he abandon or compromise on, how much of his agenda can he accomplish on his own without congressional action, and how quickly will he be able to have an impact in key policy areas?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "our guest, evan osnos, addressed those questions several weeks ago in an article in the new yorker called president trump's first term. osnos interviewed a range of legal authorities and policy experts on what a trump presidency might look like. osnos is a staff writer for the new yorker. last year, he wrote an article for the magazine about trump's white nationalist support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's reported from iraq and spent many years in china where he shared a pulitzer prize for investigative reporting while he was the beijing bureau chief for the chicago tribune. his book, age of ambition: chasing fortune, truth, and faith in the new china, won the national book award. he spoke with fresh air contributor dave davies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dave davies, byline: well, evan osnos, welcome back to fresh air. how reliable are campaign promises as a predictor of a president's agenda in office, and will trump be different?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "evan osnos: i assumed that, like, i think like a lot of americans, that campaign promises are not very valuable in terms of actually predicting the course of a presidency. we - you know, we tend to remember when campaigns say things that they don't then fulfill. but actually, the political science on this is pretty clear, and it tells a very different story, which is that if you go back over the history of the presidency, you find that presidents tend to achieve the majority - the overwhelming majority of the things that they set out to accomplish when they were candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the sort of classic study on this was by michael krukones who, in 1984, tabulated all of the campaign pledges of all of the presidents between woodrow wilson and jimmy carter, and what he found was that altogether they had accomplished 73 percent of the pledges that they said they would. this has been replicated in other studies all the way up to the present where politifact, which is a nonpartisan fact-checking site, has evaluated the campaign pledges by barack obama and found that he has achieved at least 70 percent of them. and i think his opponents would agree with that number in the sense that it has been much to their consternation that he has been able to achieve the things he has.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when candidates do not fulfill the things that they said they were going to, we remember. so, for instance, george h. w. bush saying, read my lips, no new taxes, or barack obama saying that he would close guantanamo. but those are really the exception and not the rule based on everything that scholars have learned about the presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: now, when people look at donald trump, some would say it's not clear that he has any deeply held political beliefs. i mean, he used to be pro-choice. he used to be a democrat. he's kind of been all over the place over the course of his business career, and a lot of what he says seems kind of improvised, but we have some clues. i mean, there are two big appointments just announced. the republican national committee chairman, reince priebus, will be trump's chief of staff, and at the same time, his campaign ceo, steve bannon, who is from the right wing breitbart news, will be a senior adviser with equal status to reince priebus. what does this tell us about trump's likely agenda?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: right. well, i think a lot of us were very wary of the idea that trump as president would actually do a lot of the things that he said as a candidate partly because he was, you know, obviously from way outside the mainstream and - of previous presidents. so perhaps the political science was useless. but there are a couple of things that i think are important to keep in mind. one is that the appointment of steve bannon as chief strategist and a counselor to the president is an extension of something that was very clear when this piece was written, which was that donald trump will move around on a lot of issues. he's fluid, for instance, on what he would do on the technical basis of an h-1b visa, for instance, or whether or not he would allow school teachers to carry guns in the classroom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but on three core ideas, he has stayed completely consistent. one of them is his belief that the united states is fundamentally being damaged by immigration. number two is his belief that trade deals have done more damage to the united states than they have helped. and number three is his belief that the united states does too much for the world. as he said in 2015, i want to take back everything that the united states has given the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "steve bannon, in his career at breitbart, really transformed that organization into the principal exponent of those three ideas. so what you see today is donald trump is trying to balance the strategic objectives that his campaign road to victory in the form of steve bannon with the practical necessity of how do you actually operate within washington. and for that, reince priebus, the new chief of staff, is the ultimate washington professional. he has been here for his professional life. he has really risen to the top ranks of the republican establishment, and he's now in the position to be able to try to help donald trump achieve his objectives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you know, there's a point of view that says, yeah, ideologues can have their say, but it's the chief of staff who controls the president's schedule that really moves the levers of power. do you have an opinion about whether one will be more important than the other?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: i think if you look at the way that those two roles have been used in recent history, you find that they are both important, and in many ways, that's the design here. steve bannon has called breitbart, which was his media organization, quote, the platform of the alt right, unquote. and that is the previously fringe movement on the conservative far-right edge, which was founded by richard spencer who lives in montana and believes in the separation of the races. and that has now moved sort of further into the mainstream as a result of steve bannon's rise within the trump campaign and now his installation in the white house. but in order to get those ideas accomplished, you need somebody who really is just as skilled as anyone in sort of managing the levers of inside power in washington, and that's where reince priebus comes in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: ok, i want to talk about some of the areas of policy that will matter here. and we'll try and figure out, you know, what trump has said, what he believes, what he is really committed to and what he can actually accomplish by himself and what he needs congressional action for. one thing that people have talked about is that president obama has done a lot with executive orders because of the gridlock in congress and that president trump, once he is inaugurated, can immediately undo a bunch of stuff simply by signing executive orders, repealing president obama's initiatives. is that true?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah, that's true, and that's an explicit part of the incoming trump administration's plan. campaign advisers described it to me as a first-day project, by which they meant that on the first day or within a few days donald trump would seek to sign as many as 25 executive orders, or uses of executive power in other forms, that would, in the words of one adviser, erase the obama presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i should point out that every president when they come in uses executive powers in one form or another. barack obama, for instance, signed nine executive orders in the first 10 days. doing 25 would be ambitious. people who have been through transitions before tell me that's not realistic. but he could do several things that would significantly undermine the legacy of the obama presidency. his team has talked about this since election day, that one of the things that's important to them is to restart exploration of the keystone pipeline.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they will significantly expand the pace and intensity of deportations. they will seek to, if not formally remove the united states from the paris climate agreement, then they will be able to take steps that basically undermine it so they can make sure the united states is not enforcing restrictions on carbon output. they can restrict funding and so on. so they can do things right away with the stroke of a pen that would pretty significantly undermine the legacy of the obama presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: is there some fine print here? i mean, i believe i've read that when some executive orders have gone past the rulemaking stage...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: ...there's a process. what does that mean?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah, that's right. the hyperbole in saying that they would undermine the obama presidency is that once an executive order has gone beyond what's known as the rulemaking stage, then that means that in order to undo it there has to be, for instance, a period of public comment. there has to be other bureaucratic steps. and that can take as much as a year or more depending on how efficiently the bureaucracy goes about it. and that's meaningful because i think the question of how civil servants will interpret efforts to try to undermine previous initiatives matters. but the relevant point is that by issuing the executive order the clock on that process begins.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: ok. well, let's look at some specific policy areas and figure out what might happen. let's start with climate change. you just mentioned that. do we - what do we know about his views on climate change and the extent to which he is committed to them based on his appointments so far?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: well, as a candidate and before, donald trump has expressed a lot of skepticism about climate change. he's called it a hoax. at one point, he described it as a hoax that was perpetrated by the chinese in order to try to undermine american competitiveness. he later said that was a joke. since election day, some of the appointments that he's made have made clear that he's going to make good on his belief that american energy policy and attempts to combat climate change are going in the wrong direction. so, for instance, donald trump's transition team for the epa, the environmental protection agency is run by somebody named myron ebell who has been really one of the most outspoken skeptics of climate change, runs a program here called the competitive enterprise institute, and it opposes regulation. it's not clear exactly who funds it, but in the past, it was funded by fossil fuel companies including exxon mobil and others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so this would be, i think, safe to say a radical change in the way the united states has talked and thought about climate change. one of the people that he has also indicated could be powerful in terms of shaping energy policy is harold hamm who was a billionaire who founded the shale oil company continental resources. he's been a big contributor to the koch brothers fundraising network, and there is so far no indication that donald trump did not mean what he said when he talked about climate change being a hoax that has damaged american competitiveness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: are there some specific things president trump could do immediately to change the direction of climate policy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah, he could. the paris climate deal is a formal matter, requires four years to unwind. so in the interim, he could immediately suspend american payments to the deal in effect. these are the payments that the united states would make to u.n.-affiliated agencies that would be in charge of both implementing the deal and then also helping developing countries pay for making some of the concessions and transitions that are required in order to implement it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: evan osnos is a staff writer for the new yorker magazine. we'll continue our conversation in just a moment. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with evan osnos. he is a staff writer for the new yorker. a few weeks ago, he wrote a piece about what a trump administration might look like, what powers it would have to act immediately on his policy initiatives. and we're consulting with him now to look ahead at what a trump administration might look like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let's talk about immigration. during the campaign talked about the wall at every rally building, a wall across the southern border. often at times deporting up to 11 million undocumented workers, banning muslims. do we see movement on any of those positions?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: well, he in his very first interview since election day on 60 minutes, donald trump said that he would plan to go ahead with deporting what he described as criminal undocumented immigrants. on one level, this is familiar and on another level, this could be very radical. the familiar element of this is that the obama administration's own policy has been that if you are in fact an undocumented immigrant who is found guilty of a crime, then you are in fact subject to deportation. people sometimes forget that the obama administration was criticized by some advocates for immigration for being too quick to deport people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the difference here and the point at which it may depart significantly from precedent in american history is how he defines what are the crimes and the infractions that would constitute grounds for deportation. so, for instance, is it that if somebody is convicted of a crime and goes to jail then therefore they can be deported? that will be one thing. but if it's that somebody can be stopped for a traffic infraction, for instance, or caught up in a raid at a factory or caught up in a raid at a boarding house, well then that would significantly change the way in which we understand deportation and the risks associated with it. so at this point, it's not entirely clear. he's talked about 2 to 3 million. independent estimates say that if he follows through on the plan, he's talking about that that would be 5 million in the sort of short and medium term and then ultimately has talked about trying to achieve the deportation of all 11.3 estimated undocumented immigrants. but to get to $5 million, he would have to expand to something else which he said clearly on the campaign trail which is that people who have overstayed their visas would then be subject to deportation that that represents a large part of the number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you talk to some experienced people in immigration for your piece in the new yorker about what it would take to affirmatively go out and find millions of undocumented workers and get them out of the country. you want to share a bit of that with us?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah. i spoke to julie myers wood, for instance, who was the head of immigration customs and enforcement under george w. bush, and she is opposed to donald trump-stated policies on immigration in many ways. but she also said that it's a big mistake to assume that his ideas are so radical as to therefore be impossible, and that was her major point to me was that there are tools that are at the disposal of a president that would allow them to do this dramatic escalation of deportations. for instance, a president could give the irs files to ice, to immigrations customs enforcement. so irs files are considered to be the most reliable source of home addresses because a lot of undocumented immigrants who pay taxes, for instance, put in a reliable home address so that they can receive their refund.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the president allowed it, that would then make it much easier for enforcement agents to be able to go out and find people. another thing that would be at the disposal of a president is what's known as 287-g of the immigration act which would allow the local and state agents, basically cops of one kind or another, to be enlisted in service of the deportation project. so that's how you begin to see, for instance, local police being brought in for the purposes of raiding farms or factories and beginning to achieve the deportation numbers that he's talked about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but in order to do so, it would take a significant escalation of manpower and also of resources. but what came clear from my reporting on the subject was that it's a big mistake to assume that it's - this is binary that you either will have the system as it exists today or you would have some completely unimaginable system that donald trump has talked about. there is in fact a spectrum in between that donald trump could move fairly substantially down the road to achieving his objectives on immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and it would be very expensive to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: it would be very, very expensive. depending on what he does, it could cost hundreds of billions of dollars because, for instance, if they were going to hire the number of what's known in formal immigration literature as apprehension personnel, that would need 90,000 apprehension personnel. that's several times the size of the total number of special agents in the fbi. that's not realistic. so i think more likely they would invoke 287-g which would allow them to draw on other government agencies to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: do people think he'll really build the wall?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah. i think the wall is one of the easier things to - for him to accomplish because he can redefine what the wall is, and you've heard him just in the several days since his election talk about the idea that fencing might be a part of it. the most reliable independent estimates of what it would cost to build a wall are somewhere between 25 and $40 billion. michael chertoff who was secretary of homeland security under george w. bush has been very opposed to donald trump's presidency said to me, look, i think the wall is a ridiculous idea, but it's not logistically impossible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think after talking to people on the hill and talking to immigration experts and people who are involved in the actual construction of these sorts of large-scale infrastructure, what they say is that the most likely outcome here is that he will make a symbolic extension of what is already a federally financed border fence that has been in place for about a decade. and that that would allow him to satisfy his base and to say that he has gone ahead and built the, quote, unquote, wall. but as a practical matter, it wouldn't really transform the way that the border is policed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: let's talk about health care. i mean, he has - he and many others have promised to repeal and replace obamacare. what do we know of his views since he was elected?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah, as a candidate, he and certainly everybody in his campaign that i spoke to described their intention to uproot obamacare root and branch. they talked about the replacing it, though it's not clear what that would be. since then, he has changed his view on that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he talks about holding on to two important elements of obamacare. one is the ability to insure that people with pre-existing conditions can still get insurance, cannot be discriminated against by insurance companies. and then the other is to allow people up to the age of 26 to continue receiving insurance from their parents' providers. it's not clear how donald trump would be able to preserve those two elements while undoing the rest of the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, there are some pieces of it that are vulnerable right away. for instance, donald trump and a republican congress could undermine the ability of the states to field health care exchanges. they could also remove federal funding for subsidies that help reduce the cost for individual policyholders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but if he's going to try to do what he has talked about, which is to keep those two elements while getting rid of the rest of it, that's where you may begin to see that he starts running up against the edge of some of the internal dynamics in congress because you have parts of, for instance, the freedom caucus, which is the far-right elements of the republican house conference, 40 members or so, who would regard it as a concession, probably a compromise they couldn't accept if he decided to keep obamacare and simply amended on its details. so that's where you may find that he runs up against that kind of opposition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think this goes back to something we talked about earlier, dave, that's important, which is will donald trump do the things that he says he did as a candidate - because part of the reason why presidents end up doing the things that they said they would is often not because they absolutely wanted to do those things. it's because the internal dynamics of the presidency are such that if they don't do the things they campaigned on, well, then they begin to lose credibility with congress and with the public. and so they almost get driven into these policy cul-de-sacs where they have to go ahead with things. you know, they have to sort of achieve the thing that they said they would otherwise it hurts their ability to do other things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: i mean, the tricky thing about saying that you're going to keep the provision which prohibits denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and permits kids in their 20s to stay on their parents' policies is that if you do that but don't mandate everybody to get insurance, you know, it changes the economics because you don't have young healthy people paying in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: absolutely. i mean, there's a reason why this law took so long to craft and involved so many subtleties is because you had to balance the political objectives, the policy goals with the practical economic realities. and the simple fact is that if you change one of the elements of this very delicate process, well, then it becomes very hard to imagine how you're going to be able to pay for it at all. so this - you know, we're beginning to see the point at which some of these sort of abstract declarations that he would replace it with something terrific will become much more practical and tested over the course of the next few weeks and months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: we're listening to the interview fresh air's dave davies recorded with the new yorker staff writer evan osnos about his article president trump's first term. let's talk about what changes trump might make regarding tax cuts, the iran nuclear agreement, trade and what the consequences might be if trump starts a trade war with china after we take a short break. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview fresh air's dave davies recorded with new yorker staff writer evan osnos about what it would take for president donald trump to fulfill the promises he made during the campaign and how much of his agenda he can accomplish on his own without congressional action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: let's talk about trade and the economy. you know, one of his core principles you said is the belief that trade deals have harmed america's economy and killed jobs. what authority would he have immediately to remake or undo american trade policy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: the president has broad authority on trade. so, for instance, right away, the president could end american participation in the trans-pacific partnership. i think it's fair to assume that the tpp as it's known is now dead. but beyond that, he could also force canada and mexico to renegotiate nafta or withdraw from it eventually.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is a process in the case of nafta. he couldn't just do it immediately. but when it comes to slapping tariffs, for instance, on other countries, there's two ways to do it. one requires congress and one doesn't. if he goes after specific categories of goods - so if he says, for instance, that, you know, chinese exports of one specific type, let's call it, you know, chicken or tires or something like that, then he can use his own presidential power to do that sort of on an emergency basis. but if he's going to try to impose a broad-based tariff against a country, that would actually require the consent of congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think the important point is that he has the ability to change the tenor of the trade relationship with a country by talking about it in other ways. and as we all know, you know, he talked about china in very harsh terms during this campaign. my own sense based on talking to his trade advisers and his china specialists was that that was a kind of theater. i don't believe that donald trump is prepared actually in any way to go to a trade war with china, i think, meaning that, you know, one of the things that his advisers said to me was that donald trump's persona that he - you know, he's confrontational, he says outrageous things, that that would have a chilling effect on the other side and that china would then fall in line. that's their theory. they're not actually prepared for the full economic consequences, which would be severe and profound, of a trade war with the world's second-largest economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: well, this is an interesting and important question. and you can't predict the future, but if, in fact, one of his core beliefs is that this is a big problem, we have to fix this to rebuild the american economy, what do the economists you talk to expect to happen? are we going to have a trade war? what would it do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: a trade war could be a really dramatic turn in american economic history. if you talk to independent analysts, people who are not involved in either campaign, somebody - there's a guy, for instance, named mark zandi, who's an economist at moody's analytics. and he's worked for republicans and he's worked for democrats in the past. and what he says is that trump's plan, if he actually did the things that he said he would and triggered a trade war with china that that would put probably somewhere around 4 million americans out of work. and then over the ensuing recession that it would also cost the economy another 3 million jobs that would have been created otherwise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "most economists broadly agree that a trade war would be hugely damaging to the united states. it's worth pointing out that actually trump's own trade advisers, somebody named peter navarro and dan d'amico, they disagree. they believe that in fact it could be beneficial to the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think this is one of those examples that once he gets to washington and begins to hear from a broader range of more mainstream economists that he will begin to see that, ok, you know, a trade war really is not his first priority. and this helps me kind of form a general theory of how trump will or will not do the things that he says he would. and what i've come to believe based on a lot of these interviews over the course of the last several months with people in the campaign and outside is that on economic matters, on matters of sort of tax policy, for instance, and most trade elements, i think he will basically conform to a traditional conservative set of ideas. and by the end of the campaign, his tax policy, for instance, was a fairly conventional supply-side case. it really didn't depart substantially from what previous republicans have run on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when it comes to these other issues like immigration and sort of what we might describe as sort of political culture issues, things like treatment of the press and also his dealings in foreign affairs, on those matters, that's, i think, where we should expect him to be more like the candidate trump than like a traditional republican president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: one of the things he also says he wants to do is immediately cut the regulatory burdens on businesses on wall street. can he do that himself?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: he can. the president has authority, ultimate authority over 15 executive agencies. and he would be able to direct them to change the pace and spirit in which they are issuing regulations. he has said - i'm not clear on whether this is legally possible - that he wants to do a version of what vice president-elect mike pence did in indiana.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pence created an agency that was dedicated to suspending the creation of all new regulations except for public health and safety. and it was a sort of an independent agency of its own. he did that at the state level. at the federal level, my understanding based on everybody i've spoken to is that it's more likely that he will try to do this through personnel, so, for instance, by appointing people at the top of the agencies - that the people he puts there could have a pretty dramatic effect on slowing down or stalling the creation of new regulations or rolling back things that are already in place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: he's promised big tax cuts. will they really happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: that, i think, is one of his better bets. he's got a republican congress on his side. and at this point, it's hard to see them not doing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and what kind of tax cuts are we talking about? i mean, for those of us who haven't carefully followed his campaign positions, are they upper income, middle income, everybody?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: they provide the greatest relief to the upper stratum of the tax base, so the highest earners will do best. there is also tax relief for the sort of upper-middle-class. then corporate tax rates will be substantially relieved. this has been at the core of his plan. his economics team said to me that they want corporate tax relief, meaning changing the percentage that companies would have to pay to be their stimulus plan. they want to put more money in the hands of corporations so that that can then drive growth overall in the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: if we're going to see big tax cuts and he still wants to spend a lot on rebuilding the military and some other areas, the wall and immigration enforcement, what's the fiscal impact in a world in which deficits are a serious concern?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: some of the independent analyses of his tax proposal put the impact on deficits to be in a vast range between $4 trillion dollars and $10 trillion dollars. i should say the trump administration opposed those estimates. they said that they were biased. they said that the economists who'd produced them were sort of - they tried to establish links between those economists and liberal funding sources. at this point, i think it's realistic to expect that if donald trump does the things that he has talked about even since election day, that those would impose enormous new costs on the federal government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and this is one of the ways in which he might find himself facing greater opposition than he expected from his own party because there are people in the house, certainly, and some also in the senate who would be offended by the idea of introducing these enormous new costs. that's one of the things that i think is hard to anticipate at the outset, but he's almost likely - certainly likely to kick in after the honeymoon between, you know, the republicans on the hill and this new republican white house is over.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and his answer has always been jobs and growth will take care of all that, revenues will soar. it'll be fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: that's right. that's the - you know, typically that's the traditional answer when somebody is trying to introduce a major new spending initiative while also trying to cut taxes. but historically that has turned out not to be as reliable a formula as it's often described.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: we're speaking with evan osnos. he is a staff writer for the new yorker who's written about what a trump administration might look like. we'll talk more after a short break. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with evan osnos. he is a staff writer for the new yorker magazine. he's written about what a trump administration might look like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let's talk about foreign and military policy. he's criticized the deal with iran. can he scuttle that deal by himself?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yes, he can. what he has said he wants to do is renegotiate the deal with iran, and renegotiate is a sort of a flexible word. it's not clear what he means entirely. but were he to try to reopen that deal, that could actually - that could really change the course of things more broadly beyond just the iran deal because at that point what happens is that iran - and iran specialists told me as much months ago - would regard the united states seeking to renegotiate the deal as an abrogation of the deal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at that point, they would say that the united states has basically not held up its end of the bargain, and they would have the right - the legal authority and the right - to restart the development of nuclear energy. so i think he's going to find once he begins to get into the details of this that by simply announcing that he's going to renegotiate that might not achieve the effect he has in mind. it might actually hasten the restart of the iranian nuclear program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and so - well, this is confusing. there are other countries that are parties to the deal, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: that's right, yeah. the challenge here is that in order to achieve the iran deal at all, you had to get this kind of perfect storm in the best sense where you had to get the european countries onboard at precisely the moment that you had the united states and iran at the bargaining table. and by reopening negotiations at a point when it's not clear that the united states is actually going to hold up its end of the deal anymore, that will, i think - iran specialists say as much - will have the effect of driving some of the europeans away from the table.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the chances of being able to renegotiate the deal while also preventing further development of the nuclear program are very small. and if i had to guess, i suspect that this is one of the issues that he might have an evolution in his thinking once he gets into the room with people who know the most about the status of the program now and what would happen if they restarted it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: gosh, it's hard to imagine after all of the harsh rhetoric about the iran deal and what a terrible giveaway it was and all the money that he could back away from it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: and that gets us back to this kind of the core discovery that surprised me most which is that even when candidates don't seek to do the things that they actually said they would on the stump that the internal momentum of politics ends up forcing them to do things that are more emphatic or more absolute than perhaps they might have originally imagined.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: when you wrote about donald trump and his policies towards the military and towards foreign affairs, the issue of temperament comes up. this is a loaded word. he hated being criticized for his temperament. but you have - you found a quote from his book think like a billionaire. it can be smart to be shallow, that he has a penchant for making big decisions quickly, that he trusts his gut. share what - some of what you learned about what that might mean from your conversations with military and intelligence officials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: yeah. when you talk to a broad range of people who have been involved in the most sensitive national security questions, you know - these are the people who've been in the situation room at crucial moments particularly from republican administrations what they'll tell you is that the crucial ingredient is whether or not a president is impetuous, whether or not the president makes decisions before they have as much information and as many competing points of view as possible. and often as one - james woolsey who is a former director of the cia is now an adviser to the trump administration - before he became an adviser to trump, he said to me in an interview that very often the first information that a president receives is wrong. and we've seen that beginning all the way from vietnam up to the present day. and part of the sort of crucial patience that's required is the ability to both wait until you have a fuller picture and then also be prepared to act. but if you act on the basis of limited information, history suggests to us that we would have made a lot of catastrophic choices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you look at donald trump's experience, he obviously does not have experience in government. he's never held public office or served in the military. what you find is that he prides himself - he's written about at several places - on his ability to make big decisions very fast. as he put it in his book he says, you know, i remember the day that i discovered that being shallow is a profound insight. and what he meant by that was that you don't want to get bogged down in overthinking things. you want to be able to be decisive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, in the course of the campaign, we saw moments when he would do things impulsively. he would say something in an interview on a subject that he didn't know very much about and would then find himself having to backpedal. so, for instance, when he talked about the idea of punishing women who get abortions and then was informed later that that was contrary to precedent and legal norms that he had to sort of walk that back. if you put that into a national security context, there's going to be enormous pressure on his staff to ensure that he does not do things which his authority allows him to do before he has all the information that's possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and i guess that raises the question based on past experience and, you know, people who've been there, what constraints are there on a president who might make a rash and unwise decision?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: the presidency is a unique office, to state the obvious. there is nobody who has the power to overrule the president, for instance, on nuclear authority. there are others in the chain of command who, if the president was incapacitated or disabled in some way would be able to use the nuclear arsenal. but they would have to do it in cooperation with others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what we find when you look back over the course of national security history is that the people who have interfered with a president's ability to use nuclear weapons, it's been individuals. it's been people who essentially acted out of their own judgment or conscience to do so. there's a couple examples. you know, to give you one, under president nixon, nixon actually asked his secretary of defense at the time, melvin laird, to put the united states on nuclear high alert.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nixon hoped that this would frighten the soviet union. it would make the soviet union think that he was irrational. this was known as the madman theory. and mel laird thought that this was a very, very dangerous thing to do. and so what he did is he dissembled. he told nixon that actually this was a bad idea because they had a previously scheduled training exercise, and he hoped that nixon would forget about it. nixon still said no.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "after a couple days, he wanted him to go ahead with it, so they did. they put u.s. aircraft on course to fly towards the soviet union armed with nuclear weapons just as - essentially as a gesture. and there was an after action report later that described that exercise as a dangerous undertaking because there was an almost mid-air collision. so it does depend ultimately on the decisions of individuals but how they implement the president's will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you've said one of his core beliefs is that america tries to do too much in the world, and he's made some pretty remarkable statements about welcoming new nuclear powers in the far east, like korea and japan, suggesting that we might not live up to nato obligations unless some of the nations pay more for american troops. do the experts that you spoke to think he will actually do that? and even if he doesn't, what is talking that way - what's the impact of saying those things?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: well, if you take asia for a second, in his - since election day, he has spoken to the south korean president. and according to south korean reports, he has indicated 100-percent support for that alliance. he has over the last few months disputed his own statements on the subject of whether or not he wants korea and japan to develop nuclear weapons. he said so clearly at one point, but he may have had a revision in his thinking.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's actually already had an effect on the way that nuclear weapons are understood in korea. so, for instance, if you go to korea today, you find that there are people in politics out on the edges of - particularly on the far right who are now talking about developing nuclear weapons in ways that they weren't before. and in effect, donald trump sort of gave them permission to do so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that's a demonstration, i think, of an important element here, which is that the words of a president are in their own way enormously powerful. you know, we talk about what he could sign, but really even before he signs something, just simply indicating something or saying something off hand can have a powerful effect. i think the best example of that based on the research for this piece was what he could do in europe. donald trump as a candidate talked about the idea that he might not support nato unconditionally. he was asked if a nato member, for instance, was attacked, would you come to its defense. and he said i would first check to see if they'd fulfilled their financial obligations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the rand corporation, which is a, you know, non-government research organization - over the years it's received four nobel prizes for its work on simulating conflict, on sort of gaming out future scenarios - and they had actually run a scenario just over the last couple of years that looked at exactly this question. what would happen if russia was no longer deterred from attacking a nato state? and what they discovered was that if they were no longer deterred that they could in fact achieve victory within 36 hours. they could be in the capital of estonia, for instance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and at that point then, it would come down to the question of whether the united states would seek to try to salvage nato and protect it or whether it would abandon it entirely, which if it did so would be the end of basically 70 years of american national security strategy in europe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with evan osnos. he is a staff writer for the new yorker magazine. he's written about what a trump administration may look like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there was reporting in the course of the campaign that suggests that donald trump doesn't have the patience to read long documents and burrow into policy detail. what's your sense of how he'll handle the demands of this, you know, huge waterfront of policy and decisions that you can't put on autopilot that the president needs to weigh in on?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: well, donald trump has said himself that he doesn't like to read as a way of getting information. he trusts his - what he describes as his own common sense. that's the term he uses often. he relies on people that he trusts, people that are around him. he does not have a computer. he uses his mobile phone, obviously, for twitter as we know. but this would be a profound departure from previous presidents in terms of how they get information. i think, you know, donald trump tends to want to govern from his gut.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but in the early days here since election day, we've received some indications that he has been surprised. the wall street journal reported from inside the meeting with president obama they received reports that donald trump seemed to be taken aback by the scope of responsibility that he would have as president, the sheer range of responsibilities that he would have on a daily basis. so, you know, i think what historians will tell you is that the office of the presidency has a dramatic effect on people, and the simple act of getting into the office suddenly conveys to them the solemnity of that responsibility and having 310 million souls on their watch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's not clear. you know, donald trump really is so different than anybody that we've had before that for him to change now at the age of 70 and take on a whole new set of decision-making instincts and to begin to challenge his own assumptions and his own instincts to say, look, the things that got me here are not the things that will help me succeed. i find that hard to imagine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you know, last year, you wrote about white nationalist groups that have embraced trump, and they feel he's expanded their reach, given them some legitimacy and, of course, since the election there have been some very troubling cases of swastikas, racist graffiti, some assaults racist hate speech. you know, some would see this as just a fringe that is an embarrassment to most republicans and conservatives i'm wondering what you make of this and what the impact will be of trump being in the white house?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "osnos: well, in some ways, this was a storyline that i think people who generally covered politics didn't initially embrace, you know, the idea that somehow the alt-right or the white nationalist world would be even talked about in a discussion of an incoming presidential. it was so ludicrous that we didn't even really do it. and then it just became very clear early on in the trump campaign that they were a part of this phenomenon. the neo-nazi website endorsed him for president 12 days after he announced. and later you follow it all the way through 20 months later. he was endorsed by the newspaper the kkk. steve bannon has been - who is now chief strategist in the white house - has been really the sort of principal thinker in terms of how do you take ideas that exist way out on the far right and get them in front of people's eyes that are more conventional readers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and at breitbart, that's really what he did. he sort of - it became the platform for the alt-right. when i spoke on election day to a white nationalist leader named matthew heimbach as the sort of results became clear, i said, you know, how are you feeling? and he said vindicated. and what he said was that this campaign and that the victory of donald trump has shown that there is an appetite out there for his ideas, even if people can't quite bring themselves to say so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i just have to say, i mean, this was so preposterous that we'd be talking about this a couple of years ago, that it's a reminder of how much politics have changed and been changed by the candidacy of donald trump. now, look, how that actually translates into a white house, we don't yet know. but steve bannon is now a couple of steps from the oval office, and that's - we're in uncharted territory there.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "enlarge this image toggle caption paul sancya/ap paul sancya/ap", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as of jan. 20, 2021 — inauguration day — the federal government is about to get much more involved in health care and the covid-19 pandemic response. exactly how much more involved, now that joe biden is president-elect, depends on whether republicans keep control of the senate. and that likely won't be determined until early january, when georgia's two senate run-off races are held.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump's nearly four years as president have been marked by a scaled-back federal investment and involvement in health care in a range of ways — giving states more authority to run their own health insurance markets, for example, and leaving them to come up with their own strategies for covid-19 testing, contact tracing and more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden's pledge during the campaign was to reverse that trend. he wants to double-down and invest in the changes the affordable care act made to the country's health care system, he says. he wants to pour trillions into a unified coronavirus strategy. and he wants to work with congress to create a medicare-like public insurance plan that anyone can buy into — what he's called the public option.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's a guide to his policy platforms and promises related to health care. again, how much he's able to deliver on will in some cases depend on what happens in the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "starting tuesday, long before biden is inaugurated in january, the supreme court will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. the court's decision likely won't come until spring, and in the meantime, the biden administration could try to make the case against the law moot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are a couple of things congress could do to make it so there's actually no nothing to litigate — so the supreme court wouldn't have to decide this case, it would just go away, says sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university. even if republicans control the senate, she says, it still might be possible for congress and the white house to find a compromise. i don't think the litigation is a win for republicans politically, and so they may just be perfectly happy to work out a deal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the supreme court does overturn the law next spring and congress fails to make that deal, president biden and congress would have to work quickly to come up with another way to address the possibility of tens of millions of people becoming uninsured amid a pandemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it would be savvy for the biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "assuming the aca does survive this latest supreme court challenge, biden has said he wants to build on the law. for example, he wants to address complaints that aca premiums are unaffordable — the current law only provides federal premium subsidies for households that make up to 400% of the federal poverty level. biden's plan would expand these subsidies to include people who make more money than that. he would also reverse some of the ways the trump administration has tried to undercut the exchanges; biden says he would restore funding for aca consumer outreach and for help with aca sign-ups.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the most significant change he would like to make to the aca is creating a medicare-like program that would be a public option — a health insurance program administered by the federal government, just as medicare is, but available to people of any age — that could compete against private insurance plans in the marketplace. this idea was part of the original aca but did not make it into the final law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a medicare-like public option would likely be substantially less expensive than current private insurance plans, explains larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation. that's because of the leverage the government would have to drive down the prices of doctor visits and hospital care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one example of how this works is in payment rates for doctors and other providers: medicare pays hospitals about half of what private insurance companies pay, so a medicare-like public option at medicare prices would be much less expensive than private insurance plans, levitt says. plus, he says, the government-sponsored insurance plan also wouldn't have a profit margin like private insurers have, which would also help lower premiums.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden will be taking office with the coronavirus blazing through the country — new records of cases and deaths are becoming routine, and more than 237,500 americans have already died from covid-19.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "among health care issues, there's no question the pandemic is top of the list right now, notes levitt. the pandemic will still be with us for quite some time and will likely dominate the next presidential term.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden has remarked often that he would listen to science in his approach to stopping the pandemic, whereas trump has repeatedly contradicted his own top health officials. biden has pledged to put the federal government in charge of a nationally coordinated covid-19 response, once he has the presidential reigns in january, and to use the defense production act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other personal protective equipment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while trump has deferred to the states to come up with and implement testing strategies, biden wants to establish a pandemic testing board that would coordinate a nationwide response. among other goals the board would increase drive-by testing twofold and push for the creation of at-home tests and instant tests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "like trump, biden has pledged to guarantee free coronavirus testing regardless of a person's insurance status. he also has said he would subsidize health insurance coverage for people who are relying on cobra health insurance because of a job-loss during the covid-19 emergency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "contact tracing has also been left to the states until now, though few states have enough contact tracers to help keep the spread of the virus at bay. an npr survey estimates there are 53,000 contact tracers across the country — biden would like to create a u.s. public health jobs corps to mobilize 100,000 contact tracers. similar ideas have been floated already by democrats in congress, although — again — whether such a plan could be passed into law depends in part on which party controls the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and while the trump administration invested around $12 billion in the development of potential vaccines to fight covid-19, negotiations between the white house and congress over a new covid-19 relief bill that would include money to distribute those vaccines along with other stimulus measures, have stalled. there does seem to be bipartisan support for this funding, but it's unclear if a new relief bill can happen before inauguration day. biden will likely push hard for this and other vaccine-related funding: his platform calls for an investment of $25 billion in vaccine manufacturing and distribution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it would be savvy for the biden administration to use the pandemic as a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care, says jamila michener, co-director of the center for health equity at cornell university. the pandemic gives you an opening to, for example, rebuild and further build the public health workforce. michener says biden could also support federal health agencies such as the center for disease control and prevention — agencies that the biden administration has immediate and influence over, that [under trump] have very much been eroded and are just kind of flailing in the wind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when it comes to medicare and medicaid, the federal health programs that together provide coverage to 115 million people, biden has signaled he wants to expand eligibility for these programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for medicare, the federal program for people over 65, and certain younger people with disabilities. biden has said he would like to allow people to enroll as early as age 60 and make dental, vision and hearing coverage standard issue in traditional medicare. currently, most medicare beneficiaries have to buy a supplemental policy to add on those benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in a divided congress, these changes to medicare that would cost taxpayers more money aren't likely to make it into law. i've never seen any appetite on the republican side of the aisle for something that would have greater medicare spending, says holtz-eakin. that's not the way they typically run.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in terms of medicaid, the state-run program for low-income adults, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, we shouldn't underestimate the powers that lie in the executive branch, michener says. states and the federal government jointly fund medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump's administration has been creative in how it encouraged states to change the program, she explains, like allowing for eligibility and enrollment restrictions, restricting benefits, increasing co-pays, increasing or requiring premiums, [and] implementing work reporting requirements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no reason why the biden administration couldn't do the same, although to very different policy ends. more progressive or liberal states might ask the federal government to be able to use medicaid funding for housing costs, for instance, michener says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because the notion is that housing is health, she explains. so if we can support people in keeping them housed in a variety of ways, whether it's paying for legal services for people who are being potentially evicted, or what have you, then that might be part of how we think about what a program like medicaid can do to maintain health outside of the narrow confines of hospitals or doctors offices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden has also talked about medicaid expansion, a key part of the aca that expanded coverage to more than 12 million people. only about a dozen states have declined to adopt expansion of the program. biden campaigned on the idea that the new public option could help fill the need for low-income people who don't qualify for medicaid in those states that haven't expanded eligibility. if the public option can't get through congress, though, it's unclear how the biden administration might address this issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden may also move to reverse the executive actions trump took to limit health care options for immigrants, which is another one of the areas where biden could do a lot administratively without congress, levitt says. that may include reversing the public charge rule, which aimed to deny green cards to some immigrants who use food stamps or other public benefits. (on nov. 2, a federal judge blocked enforcement of trump's public charge rule.) biden has also said he wants to expand aca coverage to daca recipients, and allow undocumented immigrants to purchase plans in the aca marketplaces, although without federal subsidies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "issue: drug & health care costs", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is the area in health policy where biden's policies might be most like president trump's. both of them have said they want to end surprise medical billing and bring down prescription drug prices, and they even agree on some ideas about how to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a key way in which biden differs from trump in his favored way to lower drug prices is biden's support for allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of medicare beneficiaries. this was an important part of the drug pricing law the house of representatives passed in 2019, but was a nonstarter for the senate led by sen. mitch mcconnell, r-ky. if republicans maintain control of the senate and mcconnell remains majority leader, this is very unlikely to get through congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there is the potential for bipartisan agreement on other measures to bring down drug costs, and to help remedy the problem of sky-high medical bills. i could see surprise medical bills being dealt with in the next administration, holtz-eakin says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the practice of surprise billing — when, for example, a patient goes to an in-network hospital but is treated by out-of-network providers who then bill the patient directly — is a particular problem that congress has tried to address. out-of-network surgical assistants (health care providers the patient never met) have become an increasing problem in this regard, policy analysts say, and surprise hospital facility fees are another problem. surprise bills and skimpy, or high deductible-insurance plans have forced many americans into medical bankruptcy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump pushed hard on congress to deal with surprise billing from out-of-network health care providers, and lawmakers got close last december, but ultimately failed to come to an agreement about how to get it done. biden has also said he would like to end the practice, but hasn't explained which approach he would support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beyond the big ticket health policy items of the affordable care act and the pandemic, there are a whole host of health care issues where i would expect a biden administration to move to reverse much of what president trump has done, says levitt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, in reproductive health, president trump has restricted federal funding for agencies that provide abortion counseling like planned parenthood, levitt says. biden has opposed that and i would expect him to reverse those restrictions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "not only does biden support roe v. wade, he has said he wants to codify its protections in law. his administration would likely make moves to allow more federal funding for abortion and to ensure no-cost contraception coverage for more employees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump put some effort into the opioid crisis — he declared in a public health emergency and created a plan to address it, though the government accountability office and other opioid policy experts say the implementation of that policy has fallen flat. biden has said he wants to increase access to treatment services for opioid use disorder, curb opioid prescriptions and prosecute pharmaceutical companies that helped feed the nation's addiction problems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then there are the significant racial health disparities laid bare by the pandemic. some of the bigger picture health policy pieces that the biden administration is going to pursue are going to be kind of disproportionately beneficial for people of color, michener says. she's also heard the biden campaign pledge to address racial disparities more head on, for instance by addressing maternal mortality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration also has been criticized for not doing enough to address the significant racial disparities in the covid-19 pandemic, including by not releasing demographic data that demonstrated how communities of color were significantly harder hit in terms of cases of the illness and deaths.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "better access and analysis of data around racial health outcomes for covid-19, michener says, is the low-hanging fruit that will easily be plucked by the biden administration.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "liasson: yes, i think republicans are unifying behind donald trump. there were predictions, of course, of a republican civil war if trump had lost. but now that he won, i think any remaining resistance to him in the republican party seems to have disappeared. only conservative intellectuals are left in the opposition. when you listened to speaker ryan yesterday, you heard him full of awe and admiration for the decisive win trump had and the fact that he had coattails. he helped republicans keep their losses in the house to single digits - only two losses in the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think, yes, it is a trump party now. he's remade the republican party in a populist, more isolationist, nativist direction. and we'll see how that plays out since his views on so many things, like trade and immigration and foreign policy and small government, are so different from those that the congressional republican leadership used to have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montagne: well, trump did say - had a list of what he would do on day one. but what is likely to be his first legislative action?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "liasson: well, i think he'll be looking for the low-hanging fruit. first, on his own, he can reverse all those executive actions president obama made on the environment or on immigration. then, in terms of legislation, i think repealing obamacare is probably the easiest and first order of business now that republicans have total control of congress and the white house. i think he'll want to appoint a ninth supreme court justice. other things - he'll want to cut taxes and regulations. he's promised to enact term limits. that might be tough because it's opposed by mitch mcconnell. then he's talked about infrastructure investment, which is something that actually could get bipartisan support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montagne: and what are you - speaking of bipartisan, what are you hearing from democrats about how they're dealing with these results?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "liasson: democrats are still absorbing the magnitude and the shock, really, of now being completely shut out of power. they're trying to figure out what happened. there's lots of soul searching and some scapegoating. democrats are angry at james comey and anthony weiner. and also, they're talking about hillary clinton herself and what a weak candidate she was. she was a status quo candidate who ran a status quo campaign in a change year. and i've heard democrats wonder if joe biden or any male candidate could have done better with the white working-class areas of the country where donald trump really built his victory.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hillary clinton outperformed president obama in cities and suburbs, but she really didn't get out the obama coalition. and she underperformed him with white working-class voters. and the interesting thing now is we've had three elections where, without obama on the ballot, the obama coalition has not turned out in full force - in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 and now this election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the other thing democrats are dealing with is they need a leader at a time when their party's bench is very thin. and for a party that has strong support among young people, they have a very old set of leaders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they're also looking at that map. donald trump seems to have blown it up and remade it. maybe the industrial midwest, the rust belt, the kind of older, whiter, less-college-educated areas are now republican states. democrats are looking to the more diverse parts of the country in the upper south and the west.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's a lot of soul searching. there also is probably going to be more tension in the party between the centrist-wing, kind of chuck schumer democrats and the left-wing elizabeth warren democrats.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "montagne: but it also has to be said that hillary clinton did win the popular vote. now, of course, donald trump won the electoral vote, so he will be the president. but does he have a mandate?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "liasson: well, that's a really good question. she won the popular vote. a mandate is always in the eye of the beholder, and it's often overestimated by the winner. he didn't really run on specific policy issues. he just promised to blow up the system and drain the swamp. and also, the majority of the country has different views than donald trump and the republicans on immigration, global warming and even health care. so i think a mandate might be pretty elusive.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "president trump is in florida again this weekend. he has stood by his attorney general, jeff sessions, over allegations mr. sessions deceived a senate committee when he denied meeting with any russian official during last year's campaign, although he met with russia's ambassador to the united states. and early this morning, the president posted tweets that accuse the obama administration of wiretapping his phones in trump tower during last year's election. there is no evidence of this. npr's ron elving joins us. ron, thanks so much for being with us.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "simon: what do we know about these tweets today? by the way, we noticed tap is spelled with two ps.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: yes, in at least one instance. we know these are coming from the president. it's a series of tweets from the president's twitter account at dawn this morning, and there's no reason to doubt it is coming from the president himself, who is in florida at mar-a-lago. it is not clear, however, where the president is getting this notion, but he says, he, quote, just found out, unquote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we don't know yet quite where it's coming from, but it appears perhaps to be a response to a narrative that's been in breitbart.com, the right-wing website that was previously published by steve bannon, the president's senior adviser. and there you will find a narrative about how the obama administration was so intent on thwarting donald trump last fall that they had much of the intelligence community doing everything it could to gather skullduggery information about donald trump and that that would have included, according to donald trump, wiretapping his phones. but there does not seem to be any direct evidence of that, as you said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: well, let's go on to other events of the week. jeff sessions, the attorney general, announced he'll recuse himself from, quote, any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the united states. he also said he'll answer questions from senate democrats in writings - writing, rather - about his meetings with the russian ambassador. will that put this to rest?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: no, this will not be put to rest any time soon. those written questions from the committee are going to have to be answered and going to have to be parsed. and, of course, now we have taken all of this to another level because of the president accusing his predecessor of conducting some sort of campaign against him, which is clearly in response to the whole sessions matter and previous to that, of course, the michael flynn matter. he was the national security adviser who was forced to resign by the president after it was revealed that he had had contacts with the russian ambassador that he had mischaracterized.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it's not going to go away as a larger issue - the whole russia connection. and, clearly, it's bothering the president because last night he tweeted out a bunch of pictures of chuck schumer meeting vladimir putin and nancy pelosi at a meeting with a bunch of russians and, you know, saying that these people are hypocrites and that they had contacts with the russians. so it's not going away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there is a moment of relief that at least jeff sessions has recused himself from, in some sense or another, overseeing the investigation into all of this by the department of justice, by the fbi, if there is going to be such an investigation. so now that'll be conducted by a deputy of his who's coming up for a confirmation hearing this very week on tuesday. his name is rod rosenstein, and he is a longtime u.s. attorney. and he is a respected figure and perhaps the best man for this job. we'll see how things go on tuesday.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "elving: that's why there are pictures of them all laughing and that sort of thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: president got good reviews for his remarks on tuesday. political analysts, who can sound like theater critics, said that he looked presidential. does any jump he'd get in the polls get undone when the president undertakes one of these tweets storms?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: it's conceivable. it's hard to know exactly what makes the polls go up and down. and, of course, we've all learned to take the grain - take the polls with a grain or two of salt. and we know, however, that this is a barometer of a president's power. so members of congress who are waiting for instructions on a lot of issues from the president are watching those polls, as well. he did get a little boost from this, but not as much as he would have gotten if it could have remained the focus of the news for the rest of the week, which, of course, it did not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simon: i - do you expect a re-drafted travel ban to be issued this week?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: yes. and i think they want to hang tough on what they had ordered before, and they want to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish before and really block refugees. but they're also going to be a little more careful this time around with how they treat green card holders - that's legal permanent residents - so that they don't get hung up. and they may also be a little more inclined to give warnings to the enforcement people so that they know what's coming. so all of this will probably be handled a good deal better, and that will probably fly with the federal courts. we'll see what's in the order, and we'll see how the courts respond.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to fight global warming that includes a vast expansion of solar and wind energy, a network of electric vehicle charging stations and a plan to reach zero net-emissions by 2050. but many moderate democrats are skeptical of those plans and republicans have mocked the proposal and successfully ran against the proposal in states like texas and south dakota.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one wellspring of that movement, of course, was electing obama's successor. the publishers of a promised land surely knew they were launching this sure-to-be blockbuster in the month when president trump would either be reelected or rejected by the voters. they knew the mountain of memories compiled in these 700 pages would appear in a certain light, or shadow, depending on the voters' verdict.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "after the uplift of the throngs on inauguration day, we settle into the rhythm that will govern the bulk of the book — the relentless beat of governing. much has to be done, many people must be met and accommodated. meetings segue into more meetings. nothing is ever easy, or really finished or quite what it seems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as a writer, obama manages to convey the grinding work of his first years in office without losing forward momentum. first, we see endless negotiations pull the economy back from the brink of a crash in early 2009, but it's a slog for the reader as it was for the policymakers. then it's on to the herculean efforts needed to haul the affordable care act across the finish line in march 2010.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but the principal irritants who get perhaps more attention than necessary are the stars of the conservative media subculture, such as rush limbaugh and glenn beck and the prime-time stars of fox news. obama also contemplates the swelling power of populist sentiment on the right, from sarah palin as the vice presidential nominee in 2008 (obama says that she had no idea what the hell she was talking about) to the nascent tea party the following year and the surge of its acolytes in congress after the midterms of 2010. of palin, obama says: hers was a biography tailor made for working-class white voters who hated washington and harbored the not entirely unjustified suspicion that big-city elites — whether in business, politics, or the media — looked down on their way of life.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the bulk of the book is a crisis-by-crisis recounting of obama's first two years in office. he does not spare us, or himself, the controversies that studded those years. some involve longstanding issues such as immigration, gay rights and abortion. some involve supreme court decisions such as citizens united, which pared back a century of campaign finance laws. we see obama delight in appointing two supreme court justices, elena kagan and sonia sotomayor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we also visit the valleys between the peaks, spending somewhat less time there, as one might expect. some seem relatively minor now, such as the firestorm over bringing khalid sheikh mohammed and four other conspirators from the sept. 11 attacks to new york for trial. we may have forgotten the fracas over the building of an islamic community center and mosque near what was known as ground zero, the former site of the world trade center towers destroyed in those attacks. but these incidents still rankle obama, who tells emanuel: if we can't speak out on something this basic, then i don't know what the point is of us being here.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "detrow: yeah, i think she changed the way that she frames her argument. and i think that does really matter politically because this is something that really gets democratic base voters excited. progressives feel like there is an appetite for this, even if it would be a big dismantling of the current health care system. i mean, think back to the fights over obamacare and how big of a drastic change that was and how long it took for voters to warm to it. this would be so much bigger.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but to come out clearly and say, yeah, i'm in favor of getting rid of private health insurance - i think that's important because president trump and republicans are going to define the nominee's health care plan as a government takeover - you know, like, you're going to have to go to the dmv to get your health care-type framing of this issue. so the fact that warren has no problem with that, i think, says a lot about the political climate of the democratic party right now.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "(soundbite of audiobook, the long game: a memoir)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcconnell: (reading) not only did i like joe, but i also learned that he didn't only talk; he also listened. he was, therefore, someone i could work with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: so, yeah, joe biden and mitch mcconnell don't have this 25-year history of working together in the senate, getting in the weeds, writing legislation. it turns out biden and mcconnell actually got closer because of barack obama. remember; when obama was elected president in 2008, he was elected with this pretty big mandate. democrats controlled the house and senate, eventually passed a big signature bill, obamacare, which, by the way, no republicans voted for. then in the 2010 midterms, republicans got control of the house, which meant that to get anything done, the two sides would have to compromise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "janet and jackie say mcconnell, the ranking republican in the senate, just did not like to negotiate with obama. for one thing, they say he thought obama's almost four years in the senate before becoming president wasn't enough time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: and one thing that mitch mcconnell respects is time in the institution. but i think also, temperamentally, president obama had not yet developed that senatorial way of deal-making. mcconnell thought that obama was very preachy and arrogant, and his nickname for him was professor obama. he just thought that biden knew how to listen as well as talk.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: so the job of negotiating with republicans fell to biden. he'd go to capitol hill, spend time in the vice president's office there, walk around, talk to people in ways that obama just didn't do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: and one thing that mitch mcconnell really appreciates is somebody like biden, who - i think he believed that biden was good at seeing the political imperative that the other side faces and being willing to be practical about that and say, ok, mitch mcconnell is a republican, he can't go past this line; i am a democrat, can't go past this line, and that that was not in obama's skill set.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: right. and then when it came to an issue, one thing mcconnell really hated is if he was talking to president obama, the president would talk about the issue as if he were trying to convince mitch mcconnell to change his mind. so let's say estate taxes. you know, he might talk to mitch mcconnell about how, well, republicans can say all they want about how this is for farmers and ranchers, but really, you know, it's negligible the number of farmers and ranchers who really benefit from this. this is the richest of the rich that benefit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, biden wouldn't even go there. he would just think, ok, the republicans got to have their repeal of the estate tax, so we got to just see how we can work it to limit it and get something in return. and he was not going to sit there and talk about the pros and cons of the issue and take up time doing that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: interesting. right. mitch mcconnell is like, yeah, we're not here to, like, make grand speeches about our feelings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: right. yeah. yeah, yeah. this isn't - his perspective was, this isn't a debating society. this is a deal-cutting exercise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: coming up, the personal moments in the relationship - after this break.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: ok. we are back, and we're talking to jackie calmes and janet hook, longtime political reporters who now work at the la times, about the relationship between joe biden and mitch mcconnell.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so a few years after all this deal-making went down between biden and mcconnell, joe biden's son, beau biden, who had also been the attorney general of delaware, died of brain cancer. it was an incredibly painful time for his father. mcconnell was the only republican senator to attend the funeral. the following year, biden was presiding over the senate in his role as vice president, and mcconnell announced he was renaming a bill to fund cancer research.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcconnell: i think it's fitting to dedicate this bill's critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who'd be proud of the presiding officer today, and that's his son, beau. and in just a moment, that's exactly what the senate will do, renaming the nih's cancer initiatives in this bill after beau biden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: it was 2016. donald trump had recently won the presidency. and the day after this, biden was presiding over the senate for the last time as vice president. mcconnell gave biden a tribute speech. he told that joke about how much biden likes to talk and referenced their deal-making days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcconnell: obviously, i don't always agree with him, but i do trust him implicitly. he doesn't break his word. he doesn't waste time telling me why i'm wrong. he gets down to brass tacks. and he keeps in sight the stakes. there's a reason, get joe on the phone, is shorthand for, time to get serious, in my office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: and i was watching that on c-span, and i was thinking, wow, he's being so funny and so warm. you know, it's just a side of mcconnell that people don't often see or hear. and i looked at the date, and i was like, oh, it's december 2016. like, in his mind, this is his farewell. you know, he's like, i'm never going to have to deal with this guy again 'cause i've - you know, we've won the white house. we've won the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: and now i can say all the nice things. and i just wonder - yeah, i can't - i wonder if he could ever have imagined, you know, this moment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: i don't think he could. i mean, a lot of people couldn't. who would've imagined that at 77, joe biden would, after passing on the run for president in the 2016 cycle, would come back and win it all in 2020? i think, like, the speech you mentioned, it was very nice of mcconnell to say that to joe biden. and in the past, mitch mcconnell has loved to compliment joe biden as a deal-maker when he was vice president to barack obama.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but knowing mitch mcconnell, you have to remember that he gets a little bit of a fiendish pleasure out of praising joe biden because he knows it drives the base of the democratic party crazy. and it's not a big help to joe biden to be...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: ...to get praise from mitch mcconnell.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: oh, my god. of course.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: that's going to be doubly true going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: that's totally it. so it's like a bit of a troll.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: exactly. do you think so, janet - that there's, like, a bit of, like, mcconnell just loves the fact that he can - it's like owning the libs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: absolutely. i think there's no question about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: so what does all this stuff that happened in biden and mcconnell's relationship during the eight years that biden was vice president tell us about what might happen when he's president? there's already been quite a bit of reporting on what a biden presidency and a mcconnell senate look like. one thing that could be affected are biden's cabinet nominations. the senate has to approve those nominations. so we're already seeing progressive names that some observers say won't be on the list. some say that actually could help biden stave off criticism from the progressive base of his party. like, mcconnell made me do it. i had no choice. i talked about that with jackie and janet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the big question hanging over all of this - right? - is, like, how reasonable is - are they going to be, right? how beholden is each one to the base that's further to the right or left than they are, right? how is each one going to respond to the new reality? like, and are they going to go sort of back to the time before - right? - like the foggy old days of 2010, 2011, 2012?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: oh, i think we know they're not going to go back to the old days. there is no going back. this really is terra incognita, though. especially with the senate, mcconnell will be important and powerful no matter which side of the majority he's on. the best - at this point, the best democrats can hope for is a 50-50 tie that's broken by the vice president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: and this, again, let's just make sure - just for people who don't know, this is only if democrats win both the senate seats in georgia in the runoffs in january. that would mean the senate is 50-50 and that kamala harris, the democrat, vice president, would be the tie-breaking vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: if the democrats have a 50-50 tie broken by the vice president, they have control over what bills come to the floor. they have control over bringing up a nomination.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: they have the chairmanships of all of the committees. it really makes a huge difference in the functioning of the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: when janet says we are now in terra incognita, she's talking about how mcconnell has, some would say, bent the rules and the norms of the senate to his political advantage, namely not allowing a vote on merrick garland, president obama's pick for the supreme court, during an election year, but pushing through president trump's pick, amy coney barrett, just before an election. mcconnell says he was not breaking norms, that the democrats had their own dirty tricks with supreme court nominations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, i asked janet and jackie if they think, despite this good working relationship between mcconnell and biden that we've talked about, would mcconnell block biden's judicial nominees? their answer - he will certainly try.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: as far as what legislation they might agree on, it's pretty well understood that some kind of covid relief package will happen not long after the inauguration. after that, infrastructure, climate change. jackie and janet say getting bipartisan agreement, even on stuff that's seen as moderate, could be far-fetched. a third of the senate is up for reelection in two years. that could motivate senators to do something or to do nothing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: we hear a good bit about how, you know, the left base of the party, the progressive wing in the party will, you know, push biden and, you know, to do certain things. i mean, mcconnell has his own sort of right wing to deal with in the senate as well. i mean, one of the things that makes the senate a different place is, you know, he has members now who are much less likely to be compromisers, also. is that part of the issue, too, for him going forward?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: yes, for sure. there are a lot of senators who never lived in the world that - of bipartisanship that biden and mcconnell can remember - that they've never served in a senate where consensus was easy and a regular part of the legislative process. so in one sense, biden will have to give a tutorial in how to approach bipartisanship to a lot of people, and that includes democrats as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hook: the other dynamic on the republican side is that there are several republicans in the senate who might think that they will be running for president and defining themselves in terms of the parameter of, how trumpy do i want to be? how do i make my mark? and, probably, negotiating with the democrats isn't a great way to get started on your campaign for president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: is not a thing you want on your report card.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: still, even if trumpiness matters to republican voters, i wondered if a post-trump world could actually be better for mitch mcconnell.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "do you think he himself is a little bit - is there a part of him that's probably kind of glad that it's going to go back a little bit to the way things were?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: oh, absolutely. i think he's the happiest person in washington that trump lost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: at least mcconnell can say he got everything he could've hoped for and then some...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "calmes: ...out of trump in the four years.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "hook: i would put it more succinctly and say that if mitch mcconnell's main goals are keeping the senate in republican hands and packing all of the country's courts, federal courts with conservative judges, he could look back at election day and say, my work is done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mcevers: but, of course, mitch mcconnell's work is not done. he just won reelection. he's got six more years in the senate. he's just been renamed the republican leader. a colleague called him the apex predator of the senate. and as of today, tuesday, november 10, 2020, mcconnell has not acknowledged that joe biden won the presidency, and he says president donald trump is 100% within his rights to challenge the outcome of the election.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kurtzleben: well, we ran what's called sentiment analysis. basically, we run his tweets through a computer program. it scores them based on how positive or negative they are. when he uses great, good, happy or whatever, then it's more positive. when he uses words like sad or failing, such as the failing new york times, then it's more negative.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: so is it possible to rank his different weeks as good weeks, better weeks, worst weeks?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtzleben: it very much is. right around his second week in office, right after he signed that executive order banning people from various muslim countries from coming into the u.s., that was his most negative week. a lot of stuff happened that week. there was that. he insulted arnold schwarzenegger about his performance on the apprentice. he put iran, quote, unquote on notice on twitter. he had a lot to say that week, and it was often quite negative.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: i'm thinking about the analysis of these tweets a little bit more. it could be that you're in a sour mood, and so you say negative things. but you also wonder if the president of the united states might feel a little bit better after he gets a few hard-edged tweets off his chest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtzleben: that's quite possible. and, you know, what's really kind of fascinating about this - very fascinating, is this - is that this is only our second president on twitter, right? we only have president obama to compare him to. now think about this. his tweets were very often neutral or maybe positive. they were very often, you know, hey, everybody, sign up for obamacare. that is not memorable.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "recently, i wrote about why many believe hillary clinton is in poor health. as a result, readers sent me tweets providing more evidence — this time, that her eyes point in different directions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to be clear, there is no evidence that clinton is in failing health. but this belief in entirely unfounded narratives isn't new; american politics has spawned a variety of out-there theories adopted by people on both sides of the aisle — that sept. 11 was an inside job, for example, or that president obama was born in kenya.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no hard evidence for these stories, but sizable shares of the american public have believed them. it turns out that it's really hard to change people's minds once they believe a piece of misinformation — even when there's better, contradictory data. in fact — and troublingly for those of us who write about these things — even refuting these rumors in a news story (yes, like we have done) can backfire and make people believe them more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in addition, political science research has found that some of the most immovable forces in american politics — polarization, low trust and opportunistic politicians — seem destined to keep these evidence-free ideas in americans' heads.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how misinformation gets lodged in our brains", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to understand why it's so hard to get our minds to unlatch from some of these ideas, it helps to know why people latch on in the first place. here's a quick rundown of the possibilities that political science and psychological research have uncovered:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "low trust. here's a factor that makes obvious sense. various studies have shown that a lack of trust, whether in other people or governmental figures, is associated with a willingness to believe conspiracy theories, as slate outlined in 2013. in a 2015 study, researchers from the university of minnesota and colorado state university likewise found that low trust in a variety of areas (in government, the media, law enforcement, and other people) is correlated with a person's willingness to believe conspiracy theories — and in particular, theories that make the other party look bad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's not hard to see how people who don't trust the government also buy into theories about cover-ups and shadowy plots: if they believe the world is a trustworthy place, they are less able to convince themselves that political rivals are engaging in nefarious, secretive plots, the authors of that 2015 study wrote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(however, the causality may flow in both directions here; another recent study from researchers at boston university showed that exposure to conspiracy theories made people more likely to distrust the government.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "motivated reasoning. this is a bit of jargon for the idea that people will interpret new information in a way that confirms their existing worldviews and identities — even when that information contradicts how they think. for example, when a new study shows evidence of climate change, a climate change skeptic might shrug it off as a bad study, a fluke or a hoax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it's not terribly surprising that if you identify strongly as a democrat, you'd be more likely to believe misinformation that paints republicans in a bad light, and vice versa. this is also tied to low trust — if you firmly believe the government is untrustworthy, you might be more willing to believe that it faked a moon landing, for example, even if evidence says otherwise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "during the george w. bush presidency, far more democrats than republicans believed that the u.s. government was covering up information about the sept. 11 attacks. likewise, surveys have shown that a large share of republicans believe president obama is muslim — in one 2015 survey, it was 43 percent, compared with 15 percent of democrats.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even worse, the trend of increased political polarization — like the u.s. has been experiencing for decades — may further boost the motivated reasoning effect, according to a 2013 study.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as people dig in to their positions and identify thoroughly with a particular side, that can make changing misguided beliefs all the harder; our beliefs become linked to who we think we are. as dartmouth political scientist brendan nyhan — one of the foremost researchers in the field of why people believe misinformation — put it in a 2016 paper, beliefs seem to be closely linked to people's worldviews and may be accordingly difficult to dislodge without threatening their identity or sense of self.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "party identification. low trust is associated with a readiness to believe conspiracy theories with democrats and republicans alike, but the same may not be true for political knowledge. the 2015 study that found that low trust is associated with belief in misinformation also found that high-knowledge conservatives were more likely to believe unfounded theories, while the same wasn't true of liberals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if that's true, then it means that conservative politicians and pundits can more readily rely on conspiracies as an effective means to activate their base than liberals, the authors wrote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "importantly, however, this may be a function of current politics — that is, at a time when a democratic president has been in office for nearly eight years. right now, in particular, republicans far more than democrats believe they are the losers in politics, as kyle saunders, one of the study's authors, pointed out in an email.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that may be one reason for the discrepancy in their willingness to believe in conspiracy theories about democrats — after all, people who believe their team is losing are also more likely to feel angry and frustrated at the government, as the pew research center has found. and, likewise, it might square with the fact that conspiracy theories against republicans were common while bush was in office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "repetition. simply talking about a rumor — even when you're correcting it — can make people believe it more. in one study last year, mit political science professor adam berinsky presented subjects with news stories about obamacare death panels and the idea that elderly patients would be forced to discuss euthanasia with their doctors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the stories came in a few different types: some simply mentioned the rumor, but others mentioned the rumor along with refutations from a nonpartisan source like the american medical association or a democratic or republican politician.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he found that gop refutations were the most effective — a republican senator saying, no, there is no euthanasia clause in the aca would seem to change people's minds more than the american medical association. meanwhile, hearing the rumors alongside a correction from a nonpartisan or democratic source may have even raised the number of people who accepted the rumors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "not only that, but he also found that asking people to recall the entire articles weeks later — even articles containing refutations — made them more likely to believe the rumors than if they were asked to recall a minor detail from the articles. that is evidence of what psychologists call fluency — the notion that people will find a more familiar idea more believable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(this means covering particularly loud rumors becomes a dilemma for journalists: covering it could spread misinformation, but not covering it means not explaining a story to your audience. the best answer, nyhan wrote in the columbia journalism review, is to label conspiracy theories for what they are, and not give them more room than necessary.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so how do you get misinformation out of people's heads?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the above list provides a few clues to how people's false beliefs could be reversed ... and it isn't promising. for his part, berinsky says that he feels he has been largely unsuccessful in figuring out how to get people to give up their unfounded beliefs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one less-than-encouraging trend: trust in government — as well as a variety of institutions, and even in other people — has plummeted in recent decades. reversing that kind of a seismic shift in the national psyche could be next to impossible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "likewise, if polarization does make motivated reasoning worse, that's another big problem. polarization among congressional members is at its highest point since at least the late 19th century, and polarization among americans has also grown drastically, a result of an array of factors that seem difficult, if not impossible to reverse: self-sorting; segmented media; the political issues that are important; and the party realignments of the 1960s and '70s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, there are a few lessons here: for example, getting the right person to do the fact-checking can make all the difference. berinsky pointed to mcdonalds' decision years ago to get rid of super size fries, amid widespread demand for more healthful fast-food options.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if a business is selling french fries and they're telling you french fries aren't good for you, that's a really credible source, berinsky said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "journalists can also learn a few useful things from these studies. repeating a rumor too much can make it stick, for example. furthermore, using graphics in a fact check seems to make it stick more easily, as nyhan has found.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "political conspiracy theories are nothing new in the u.s. — just look to richard hofstadter's classic 1964 essay on the paranoid style in american politics for proof. he lists our country's long history of believing in shadowy forces — in the 1700s and 1800s, conspiracy theories about masons and the illuminati were common, for example.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "belief in rumors and conspiracy theories appears shallow, but widespread — it's not that there are a lot of americans who fear chemtrails, wear tinfoil hats, and believe that mysterious cigarette-smoking men are hiding the truth about ufos. in that 2015 paper, berinsky presented subjects with seven rumors, and found that only 5 percent of subjects believed all seven. however, each subject believed 1.8 on average.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what would change, they argue, is that the spending would be done by the government, with taxpayer dollars, rather than via copays and premiums, for example.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we are going to do this by saying everyone is covered by 'medicare for all,' every health care provider is covered, she said. and the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one, pushed by sens. susan collins (r-maine) and bill nelson (d-fla.), is called reinsurance. this is a fund that would help insurers pay for the sickest patients and would guarantee the insurance companies do not face large losses. the idea is that if insurers don't have to worry about covering the expenses for their highest-cost patients, they can keep premiums lower for everyone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aca had a temporary reinsurance program from 2014 to 2016. it was intended to help insurers get started in a market where sick people were able to buy their own insurance for the first time. prior to the law, most insurers did not cover many people with preexisting health conditions. if they did, it was at an extremely high cost.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "state insurance regulators managed to find a workaround for trump's sudden cancellation of the federal cost-sharing payments.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that means, however, if the cost-sharing reduction payments were reinstated for 2018, as the original legislation called for, insurers would have to give the excess money back to the government.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "some advocates have suggested that congress should guarantee the payments for 2019 and 2020. but antos says that also makes no sense because the insurers would then think 'are we going to go through this again?'  they might raise premiums even further to make up for the uncertainty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "antos — and many other analysts — agree that instead, restoring or creating a new reinsurance program would likely do more to control premium increases.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the president did not mention using emergency powers to build the wall in his speech, but has suggested to reporters that he might consider using those powers if congress doesn't agree to authorize its funding in a spending bill for the department of homeland security. declaring a national emergency would allow the president to divert funding set aside for other purposes for the wall.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama, who has consistently praised bush for the way he's handled his ex-presidency, faces a conundrum about how to handle his own. though he's vowed to ensure a smooth handover of power, obama is keenly aware he's being replaced by a new president who holds antithetical views on issue after issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president spoke out vigorously throughout the campaign against trump's calls for banning muslim immigrants, deporting millions of people living in the u.s. illegally, repealing obamacare, and canceling the paris climate deal, to name a few. those policy proposals and others like them have stoked fear for many americans who oppose trump and are hoping vehement opposition from obama and other democrats might prevent trump from implementing them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "though obama didn't specify what might trigger him to break silence, he left himself a broad window of possibilities. his comments suggested he'd be most inclined to weigh in if trump violated basic principles obama has tried to uphold, such as minority rights, equal protection and respect for civilian life. obama has long warned that trump might impulsively use nuclear weapons, and has cast a dim view on ideas like a muslim registry, which trump's incoming chief of staff declined on sunday to rule out.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "some of the upgrade also seemed attributable to the abc moderators, all four of whom were crisp. they had challenging questions and they probed in their follow-ups, but they did not intrude on the dynamic among the candidates. like good referees, they pretty much let the players play — to the benefit of all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's hard to know how biden, soon to be 77, would look to the democratic electorate based solely on this debate performance, given how long he has been around. even more of a factor is the defensiveness many democrats feel about the guy they still think has the best chance of beating president trump. but more of that in a moment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders, who is already 78, came across as every bit his age and just as irascible as he was at just 73 and challenging hillary clinton for the last presidential nomination. he once again made a strong case for the national health care system he calls medicare for all — a concept that now gets at least lip service from many of his rivals, as well as pushback from a few.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even though sanders' goal is to make the famous health program available to everybody, it is, for now, still primarily associated with old folks. it's likely to be the democratic party vehicle for getting to national health care, sooner or later, so it could use --– and likely will have — more age-appropriate champions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, it was biden's age that was called into question in this debate, when he had talked about who would qualify under his amendments to obamacare. julián castro, at one end of the stage, objected to what sounded like biden contradicting himself. when biden interrupted with a denial, castro fired back, are you forgetting already what you said just 2 minutes ago?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "without that word already, that question might have stood on its own. instead, it seemed a shot at biden's age and past lapses of memory. the audience reacted with a mix of groans and applause. they took it as a shot, and it played as such endlessly on broadcast highlights and in panel post-mortems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "castro may have been the victim of his own need to distinguish himself from the pack, a problem shared by all but the three candidates at center stage. he was anchoring the end of the lineup because his polls and fundraising are barely meeting the criteria for inclusion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "also in endangered status was the candidate at the other far side of the stage, minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, who continues to emphasize her middle-of-the-country roots and middle-of-the-road positions. her focus on the middle surely includes the early-caucus state of iowa, her neighbor to the south, where she needs a breakout showing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "just inside from the two ends onstage were two candidates who were expected to make more noise than either has to date: one was cory booker, the senator from new jersey, a tall and commanding figure who got the night's best laugh and said many eloquent things on gun violence and the status of his fellow black americans. the booker campaign professes to be unworried, but it is hard to fathom why booker has not broken through in the early states or the national polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the same might be said of beto o'rourke, the former congressman from el paso whose campaign has drawn new impetus from last month's massacre in that city. o'rourke was saluted by his rivals for his strong stance, and he had a viral moment saying: hell yes, we're going to take your ar-15, your ak-47, referring to the military-style weapons used in many recent mass shootings. that promise, however, does not reflect the position of most of the other candidates or of the democratic caucus in the house or the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moving in toward the centerpiece trio, one found mayor pete buttigieg of south bend, ind.,, who used every chance he got to insert thoughtful answers with a fine-chiseled edge. he used his closing remarks to say how much it had meant to his life to come out as gay and marry his husband. the fact that his age, 37, may be more of a weight for his candidacy than his sexuality is one measure of how life in america has changed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "which leaves us with kamala harris, the one candidate who stood aside from the threesome at center stage but was not part of the trio on either wing. the california senator tried a good-natured jab at biden regarding his oft-repeated ties to president barack obama. it worked in its way, especially with the crowd at texas southern university, a historically black school. but it didn't have nearly the bite of her june debate challenge to biden for his opposition to busing for school integration in the 1970s.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sasse: well, you're asking a fair question that you - i understand why you'd want to put to a lot of republican senators. but i actually hold the exact same position now that i held in 2016, which is that there are two plenary powers in the constitution. one is for the president to nominate. and the second is for the senate to advise and to provide consent or not assent and not consent. and i reached out to the obama administration and told them the kind of person i'd like to see them nominate. and so i believe that we need people who understand why they put on a black robe. i believe the same thing now that i believed in 2016.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "alexander also urged president trump to continue what's known as cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies through september. these payments help to lower copays and deductibles for low-income americans who earn 100 to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. the trump administration has been doling out the payments on a month-to-month basis and threatening to end them altogether, which is spooking insurers into raising rates.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's not the first time the president has threatened to cut off these payments, which he refers to as bailouts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but these payments aren't designed to compensate insurers for business failures. rather, they reimburse insurance companies for discounts the law requires them to give to low-income people who buy insurance through the affordable care act exchanges. the federal money offsets the money insurers lose by lowering the deductibles and co-payments they require of these policyholders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump, who is angry that the congress failed to pass a law to repeal and replace the affordable care act, or obamacare, has been wielding his threat to withhold these csrs — which could cause chaos in the insurance markets – in hopes of forcing lawmakers back to the table to try again to get rid of the health care law.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "should the payments cease, insurers will be required to fund cost-sharing reductions on their own, murray says. if that happens, they will either raise their rates – our plans indicate that it could be by up to 23 percent – to compensate for these losses, or they will withdraw from the markets altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if trump does decide to stop making the payments, it may end up costing the u.s. treasury more, while insurance companies who remain in the markets could do just fine.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "if those subsidies go up enough, more people could be lured into the exchange markets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the obamacare exchanges require insurance policies to conform to one of four metal levels -- bronze, silver, gold or platinum — which coincide with how much an individual is expected to pay in premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. a bronze plan covers about 60 percent of a customer's health care costs, with relatively low monthly premiums, while a platinum plan will cost more each month but pay 90 percent of total health costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the law provides income-based tax credits to people to buy insurance, and those credits are calculated based on the price of silver plans. last year about 85 percent of people who bought obamacare insurance got a credit, according to the center for medicare and medicaid services.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that means subsidies will have to rise for many people to meet those higher premiums. some people may take that bigger subsidy to buy a cheaper policy — and many could even get insurance for free, according to oliver wyman, because premiums on bronze plans probably would not rise as much as those on silver plans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "roders turner: we would have people come to us, consumers coming to us. they know they're uninsured. they know that we can potentially help them. but when we would, you know, go through the process of saying, like, this is the affordable care act, the health insurance marketplace, they would say, oh, obamacare; i thought that was gone.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "simmons-duffin: well, there are about 26 million people who are uninsured right now. and cynthia cox, who's the vice president of the program on the affordable care act at the kaiser family foundation, recently did an analysis on this. so i asked her to describe the people who are eligible for low- or even no-cost plans on the exchanges but are uninsured.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "simmons-duffin: so she says knowing all of this could help the biden administration figure out how to shape their outreach campaign, and she says they've got a healthy budget to work with - about a billion dollars in funding that the trump administration had for this outreach and just left on the table.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jake sherman, anna palmer, welcome to fresh air. so we're supposed to be a government of checks and balances. the congress voted against giving president trump the money he requested for the wall, so the president declared a national emergency to build the wall and plans on getting the money from other parts of the budget. and republicans who voted against funding for trump's wall seem to be willingly ceding their power to the president - ceding their power as being, like, a check against the president. tell us why you think that's happening.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "gross: so republicans have traditionally been against massive federal spending and against deficits. but right now, i mean, the tax bill that republicans passed has greatly added to the deficit. spending for the wall that the president wants - i mean, that's a hugely expensive bill. and it's another issue where republicans don't seem to be standing up to trump on that. have republicans changed in their attitude toward spending as the party has gotten further to the right? have the priorities shifted?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: yeah. i mean, i think it's actually pretty stunning. when jake and i have been covering capitol hill republicans in power for years, the orthodoxy was, spend less, cut spending. and donald trump came in and really doesn't care about any of that. and so one of the kind of interesting things that we discuss in the book - and talking to members who were his key allies, whether that's mark meadows of north carolina or jim jordan of ohio - that kind of cutting spending and government waste is - was how they came into office.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sherman: it was. and this is something that history will have to reckon with in a way that we are not able to at this moment or we're only beginning to be able to at this moment. but paul ryan's orthodoxy - his entire intellectual makeup and his entire partisan makeup - has completely shifted. as you noted, he was a spending hawk, a deficit hawk, who spent the first 15 or 20 years of his congressional career railing against the - a bloated bureaucracy and a bloated federal government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and he - donald trump - got into office. and in a sense, paul ryan, i believe, felt like he had lost the argument - that he presented one view of america, which he believed for - between 1999 and 2016. he was on the presidential ticket in 2012. and then donald trump got elected, presenting another, completely different view of the republican party in america. and donald trump won the presidency.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sherman: i would say one more thing on top of that. i think that writing this book has made - has sharpened this point in my mind - that politicians really exist in a political moment, meaning they act the way they do because of the political dynamics at one moment. and number two, politicians are there to gain power, keep power and increase power. and however they might do that, they'll do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in this situation, lindsey graham basically said back home - anna alluded to this - what the president said about john mccain wasn't right. but the voters of south carolina put me in office to get things done and to work with this president, and i'm going to do that - basically saying, i understand that he's critical of my very close - former very close friend john mccain. i don't appreciate that. but i also have something else i need to do, which is to work with donald trump to achieve the policies i'm looking to achieve. and he's pretty brash about that. and he's pretty honest about it, even though, to everybody else - and many people we talked to - they find it to be intellectually dishonest. but that's the way he views it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what are republicans looking to right now to see if the winds are shifting against trump? - because if they're aligning with trump because they think it's going to help them with re-election, then they need trump's support. but if trump is losing support, then it would hurt them to be aligned with trump when the next election comes around. so how are they testing the winds on that? - because it's always - it always seems to be questionable if there's going to be a point at which the wind shifts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: you saw this recently. the president said he wanted to do health care reform. and republicans said, no, thanks. we lost the house of representatives because we got into a prolonged fight over health care reform, a policy that republicans do not have their arms around in a real, big way. and i think you saw them back off on that. and you see them back off on several other fronts, too. i think they're trying to put distance between themselves and the president where it's useful.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sherman: yeah. the center of gravity in the house of representatives among democrats is nancy pelosi, the house speaker. and that's the - kind of an eternal truism about democratic politics. nancy pelosi has been the leader of house democrats now for a very long time and is probably as powerful as ever. and if you ask nancy pelosi about the green new deal or medicare for all or any of these positions that some of the younger members are advocating for, she kind of deals with them in her own way by saying, i'm as progressive as they come, but i'm also about getting an outcome. i'm about solutions that can pass the house of representatives and have a chance of, some point, getting into law. and she's spoken very dismissively about the green new deal and about medicare for all and says we actually have a good health care system, called obamacare, and we should improve and strengthen that. and she talks about the green new deal as the green new dream. she knows the name, obviously, and she knows what's in it. but she's dismissive of it, in a sense, and says she has her own solutions that she's been working on for many years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think there's some of the older guard. the democrats that have been in the house of representatives for a decade or more feel like they've been working on these issues for a very long time, and in come a new crop of freshmen and they're taking all the credit for it. and i think there's some tension there. but there's no question that the younger democrats, like alexandria ocasio-cortez and some of her allies in the house of representatives, have brought an energy to the house that we really haven't seen in a long time, especially on the left. i mean, we saw a little bit in 2010 with republicans, but - definitely have brought a new energy and a new vigor to a house democratic caucus that was increasingly old.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: how are divisions among democrats effecting the tactics that they're using to move forward with opposition to the president? are they divided on those tactics?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: minorly, but not really in a major way. i'd say the one thing democrats are completely on the same page on is going after president trump with all the weapons and all the tools they have. now, there is a small clutch of democrats at the moment who believe that the party should immediately move to impeach the president. that's still a very small minority in the house of representatives among democrats. but i think that they have largely stuck together when it comes to demanding the president's tax returns, issuing subpoenas for bank records going back several decades from the president's businesses, things of that nature. i don't think you see much divide there, and i don't think you will, going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but in a way, democrats are helped by president trump in that there's not much that could get the president's signature. they're not going to pass many bills into law. so they only really have to stick together on these big investigatory committees, on these big oversight issues, which is not difficult with a president who probably polls in the low teens, if that, with the democratic base.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: president trump - you write that president trump wanted nancy pelosi to be speaker after the democrats won the house and that his plan was to ask the freedom caucus - the most conservative members of congress, who are also his allies - to vote for her. and trump told you that he thought the most conservative members of congress would do him a favor and vote for nancy pelosi as house speaker. tell us more about that. that's an interesting and surprising story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: i do think that there is some dynamic between pelosi and trump that's hard to capture and hard to explain. it seems like, from our experience both talking to the president and watching him publicly, he does seem almost taken by pelosi, taken by her power, taken by her ability to corral democrats together to keep them on the same page. and he lamented to us in the book that democrats stick together much better than republicans do, and that's something that he was very upset about and very regretful that republicans couldn't stick together. he doesn't appreciate democrats' policies, he says, but he appreciates their unity, which was an interesting insight into the president's head.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but also, furthermore, i do think that the president likes cutting deals with democrats periodically. i think he likes the hollywood flair, in his mind, and the ratings - again, in his telling - of doing business with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer - by the way, two people that he's known for a very long time. so it's a very interesting relationship, and i think we'll see more in the months ahead between the democratic speaker, who, by the way, president trump was a donor to and was very, very, very praising of when he was a developer in new york.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "let's talk about the role of the freedom caucus. you write about the freedom caucus a lot in your book. and i should say the freedom caucus is basically a far-right republican caucus within the house. and their role has obviously changed from when the house was run by republicans to now, when it's run by democrats. but tell us how they were first created.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: the freedom caucus came to be during john boehner's speakership, and it was started by jim jordan and mark meadows - jim jordan of ohio, mark meadows of north carolina. and they wanted a small group of people who would be able to stand up against their own party when they thought their party went astray. and i visited jim jordan at his home in ohio in reporting this book and talked to him about this. and he compares it to a union because in the house of representatives, you don't have power as a single member of congress. you have power if you band together and starve the speaker of the house of the ability to move legislation. and they were able to do that on almost every issue - tax reform, health care reform, spending, immigration. they were able to hold the party's feet to the fire, hold donald trump's feet to the fire and drag every piece of legislation to the right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they found a kindred spirit, in a sense, in donald trump, who was elected, obviously, in 2016. they had been planning to try to oust paul ryan if hillary clinton was elected president. instead, they found themselves with a ideological ally in the white house or someone they thought could be an ideological ally. and they have - and it's no overstatement to say they have really shaped the republican party in that image and shaped, in a small way, america the - some policies that got enacted into law in donald trump's presidency in their image over the last couple years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what are the tactics that they used during republican control of the house to block legislation they didn't like and to move legislation further to the right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: yeah, i mean, they oftentimes - a lot of it's behind the scenes - right? - so it's not just going to the house floor. but it would be starving john boehner first and then paul ryan of the necessary votes to get bills passed. they would - you know, in the book, we detail how both mark meadows and jim jordan went to the floor and, you know, kind of would give speeches that then would get played on fox news that then the president would see. and so you see their impact kind of all along the way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i would also say they also had - they - particularly mark meadows has a very good relationship with the president. and he was brought in on tax reform kind of surprisingly after he and jim jordan wrote a letter saying these were the kind of, you know, four or five things that needed to be in tax reform for their support. and not only did the president read it, but then the president wanted to make sure that he kept those guys happy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: one other tactic is they took unrelated bills hostage. they were looking for certain policies on immigration reform, so instead, they starved republicans of the votes they needed to pass an agricultural policy bill. so they would take completely unrelated issues hostage to get what they want on issues that donald trump cared about, like immigration reform, immigration overhaul, restrictive immigration policies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they were really bending the legislative process to their will and angering a lot of people, but they saw paul ryan and the house republican leadership as not representative of what donald trump got elected to do. they thought donald trump got elected on a very simple platform, which was building a wall on the border with mexico and very restrictive immigration policies. and it was - in their view, they needed to do everything they could do to help the president achieve those ends, which, at times, included blocking unrelated pieces of legislation to make a point and to achieve an end.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: did the freedom caucus have just enough people to block legislation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: yes, they had a little bit more than the margin that republicans had over democrats, which allowed them - basically gave them veto power over anything that paul ryan wanted to do. so if they stuck together, they were the most powerful 20 people in america or 30 people, depending on who their allies were on that specific issue, which is amazing. we had never seen power exercised like this in the modern house of representatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: i don't think you can underscore how frustrating it was to republican leadership that this kind of band of ragtag republicans that typically would never have been taken seriously would've, you know, given rousing speeches on the house floor, but would never have been able to control the agenda how big of an impact that made.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he thought nancy pelosi - there was no way nancy pelosi could stand up for not having a wall on the border with mexico. and he put that theory to a test and pushed donald trump into a government shutdown. so those were the kinds of things he did to try to achieve ends for donald trump. and i think the president realizes now that those tactics are not necessarily successful, not necessarily good strategy, but that's what jim jordan tried to do. he put the government in crisis and believed that he would be able to achieve an end out of that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "palmer: really, when you look at the republicans and conservatives writ large across the country, the judiciary and the importance of the judiciary has been something that they have been talking about for years. it's something that wins elections for them. it's something that really energizes their base - you know, getting the supreme court to be more conservative. and what you've seen this congress and even before is that mitch mcconnell - his single focus, more than anything else, has been to try to push through more judges that are conservative and - particularly in the trump administration, they are younger. they are conservative. they are going to be on the bench for a very long time.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sherman: well, i think it's most important to note the kind of unwritten rule that he changed back in obama's years. president barack obama nominated merrick garland to be a supreme court justice when scalia passed away. and mitch mcconnell, at that moment - that day, he was on vacation with his wife in the islands. and the moment scalia, who he knew very well - the moment he died, mcconnell took a pen out and wrote a statement, sent it to his office, saying, merrick garland will not be given a hearing. the next president will choose the next supreme court justice - which, by the way, was a massive gamble for mcconnell because hillary clinton was ahead in the polls. donald trump, who mcconnell likes to remind people was donating money to chuck schumer just a few years ago - republicans weren't confident about how donald trump would view the judiciary, so it was a huge gamble. but mcconnell - that was mcconnell's goal, to not get merrick garland a hearing and not give him a vote on the floor. and he achieved that. and from that, he got neil gorsuch. and later, he got kavanaugh. but that's right. i mean, mcconnell has fast-tracked the procedures to get nominees to the floor and has done so with stunning success and has gotten dozens of judges on to federal courts across the country. and congresses come and go, and people don't always remember that. the house flips all the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate flips all the time. judges have lifetime appointments, and that's incredibly important to remember when thinking about mitch mcconnell and his long-term goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: one of the things that mcconnell recently did was to cut the debate time from 30 hours to two hours for judicial and administrative nominees. what's the significance of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: the senate has very arcane rules, to say the least. and it just basically, in layman's terms, allows him to move judges - more judges in a short period of time. remember; the senate is home probably one out of every four weeks. so instead of taking several days to move judges, he can move several judges in one day. and that's incredibly, incredibly important because the judiciary committee in the senate can move judges out of their committee quite quickly. but there was this threshold that forced a slowdown in that process, and mcconnell has completely removed that stumbling block. and mcconnell's critics will say, well, this might not benefit you when you're in the minority. but mcconnell's retort is that democrats are blocking, and they're forcing republicans to use up all of those 30 hours. and that's preventing the president from getting the judges he wants. and that's, obviously, a very big priority of the president, which mcconnell is helping him out with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: do you think mcconnell is also thinking, by the time the democrats have a majority, there will be so many conservative judges who have been appointed, it won't matter that much?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: sure. i mean, i think he's making a gamble to say, i'm going to stack the judiciary as far as he can according to democrats' perspective. and, you know, he's going to continue that mission. when we sat down with him - i think a lot of people wonder what motivates mitch mcconnell because he's a man of few words. he doesn't get fiery. he rarely, you know, kind of does long speeches or different things like that. he's been in politics for a long time. but the one thing that is clear is he sees his legacy as the federal judiciary.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sherman: we've been covering it together since 2009.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: ok. ok. so what are some of the ways you've seen congress change in that time?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: i definitely think that it has only become more partisan. i think that the way elections start - the day after a member is elected, they're raising money. they're trying to go back to their districts. there's not a lot of community and bipartisanship in a sense of republicans and democrats getting to know each other as humans, as people. and i think that's to the detriment of, you know, the institution in the sense that you don't give your colleague on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt that they're coming from a good place. i do think the amount of money in politics has also increased tremendously in my time covering washington. and the amount of dark money and 527's after citizens united has had a huge impact on the overall tenor of things as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: and i think anna's right on the money front. i mean, individual house races - races that are conducted with electorates of five-, 600,000 people are costing tens of millions of dollars, which is just astronomical. people were raising several hundred thousand dollars in the past. now they have to raise three-, $4 million for competitive races. and i think everything has become politicized. i mean, starting in 2009, republicans made a calculated choice to - in the worst financial crisis in a very long time - to allow president obama to pass legislation on his own without their help. it was a political decision, but it really set the tone for the last decade of legislating. and i'm not sure republicans realized that at the time, but their decision to really oppose barack obama at every turn set the tone for just a really partisan phase in our politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: now that the democrats control the house, it seems the people who really watch right now include the heads of some of the committees, like the house intelligence committee, ways and means, judiciary - the committees that are really investigating president trump and continuing to investigate russian interference in the election. so how are you covering them? you know, like adam schiff, jerrold nadler - they hold a lot of power now, and what they're trying to do could prove to be very significant.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "palmer: i think we cover them like we always have. i think one of the great things about being a reporter on capitol hill that is unlike any other institution is the amount of access that you have to these members. you can follow them in the hallways. you can wait for them after votes. they regularly talk to - both republicans and democrats talk to reporters. and so i think that now that they're in power, we cover them because they get to make some of the key decisions about whether these investigations happen and how they happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: and also they're sending letters every day. i mean, they're really pressuring the administration. but we also - it's important to keep in mind that everything flows through nancy pelosi. she sets the tenor and tone of all these investigations, and it's important to listen to every one of her utterances on every topic to really know what the democrats are going to do when it comes to investigations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i will say, within the democratic party, there is some nervousness about looking overzealous. i think that's something that we'll begin to see in the next couple months is democrats wanting to make sure they proceed with caution because while holding trump accountable is very important both substantively and in the polls - it polls very well - there is concern of overreach and going too far too quickly too much. there's a lot of committees looking into the president, and it's the democratic leadership's job to keep it streamlined, to keep everybody in line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: i want you to tell a couple of stories about jared kushner that you learned that show the ability he thinks he has to fix things and to, like, change how congress operates for the better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: during the shutdown, during the immigration fight in late 2018, jared kushner was not really involved in the immigration policy and not really involved in anything that was going on. and the - as the government was about to shut down, moments from shutting down, jared kushner blew into a meeting with with paul ryan, steve scalise and kevin mccarthy and said, i wasn't involved earlier, but now i am, and i can fix this quite quickly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so jared tended to think, according to people that we spoke to for the three-year period, 2 1/2-year period that we were writing this book, that he had a unique ability to, again, bend the government to his will and to do things that otherwise people thought were impossible. and he came up short a number of times. he did have one big success in the trump administration, which was he passed - he helped pass a criminal justice reform bill. but that's about it. that's really the only episode where he had been successful in getting congress to do what he wanted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: like a lot of other reporters, you reported that president trump, you know, watches a lot of tv. and if he likes you on tv, he'll make an alliance with you or maybe give you an appointment (laughter). and so i'm wondering. he sees you on tv probably 'cause you - you're on tv a lot. and has that affected your access to him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sherman: i don't think so. i mean, he's acknowledged passively that he has seen us on tv earlier before we started writing this book. so i don't think it's impacted our access to him, but it certainly has impacted other people's access to him and frankly has impacted who he's put in key government positions and who he's given jobs to and who he likes defending him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i mean, we write in the book that members of congress have literally rearranged their schedules so they can appear more frequently on television, which is really one of the chief ways that washington has changed - is that daytime television is really prime real estate for policymakers and journalists and people who are trying to speak to the president or who want the president to hear them. i mean, dayside cable, which was at one point kind of an afterthought in the media climate, is now really prime territory for a lot of people.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "shapiro: you're talking about people who don't make a lot of money, who get coverage under the insurance exchanges, get basically underwritten by the government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: exactly. so these are people who earn maybe $20,000 or so a year. and if the co-pay is normally $10, they might pay a $3 co-pay because the government is paying the other $7.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is a lawsuit right now brought by house republicans saying that these cost-sharing reductions are illegal. the biggest thing the trump administration could do right now to undermine the affordable care act is just stop defending the lawsuit, to say, we agree with house republicans; they're illegal. and that would wipe out a $7 billion fund that provides these cost-sharing reductions to low-income americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: you write that the trump administration could stop enforcing the individual mandate, the requirement that everybody have health insurance. didn't president trump sign an executive order basically saying this when he first took office?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: not exactly. so he did sign an executive order that told the whole trump administration to get rid of whatever regulations, whatever mandates you can. just try and cut them out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the hard thing about the individual mandate is it's part of the affordable care act. you can't really get rid of it entirely through regulation. but what the trump administration can do is essentially change the rules around the individual mandate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they could say, the fine seems to be too onerous, so we are going to scale it back this year, or we're going to create more exemptions from the mandates so fewer people have to pay.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "shapiro: also on this list of ways the trump administration could undermine the affordable care act, there has been a lot of debate about essential health benefits. those are 10 categories of services that insurers must cover under the affordable care act, like maternity or pediatric care. what would it look like if the trump administration decided to narrow the definition of these services?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so you would have much skimpier health insurance plans. things like you mentioned, ari, maternity care, for example, used to not be covered in most individual market plans. the trump administration is a little bit restricted on how much it can do on the essential health benefits here. they're actually written into law. so in the affordable care act, it says that all insurance plans must cover maternity care, these other sets of 9 benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we're waiting to see right now, do they think there are things they can do through regulation to narrow that down or narrow down within maternity care - for example, what counts as covering maternity care? - or turn more of a blind eye towards health insurance plans that aren't covering those benefits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: can you give us an example of, for example, if they scaled back maternity care, what that might look like?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but what they could do is say that fewer services count as coverage, essentially, to say, you know, as long as you're covering the actual delivery, that counts as maternity care. and we won't make you cover all the rest of the things associated with the pregnancy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shapiro: if we imagine the trump administration doing everything within its power to undermine the affordable care act, how significant will the likely impact be? could the administration basically make obamacare fail by implementing all these changes?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one of the things that's important to remember about obamacare is it really varies a lot state by state. you have states like california that has a very active board running its marketplace. they'll be fine. they will make this work because they want to make it work. but you have big, rural states, like alaska and tennessee and a lot of states in the south, that could teeter into collapse if you make the policy decisions that are generally going to decrease enrollment and make insurance companies less excited to be part of the marketplace.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "scott horsley, byline: aetna and other big insurance companies say they've lost hundreds of millions of dollars trying to compete in the obamacare marketplaces. insurance premiums collected by those companies haven't covered the cost of providing health care to a population that's turned out to be smaller, sicker and more expensive than expected.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sara collins: there is a concern that in some markets they'll be fewer competitors, and we know that when a market dips below three plans, the price competition really drops. there's just less incentive for plans to offer lower prices. these will likely be mostly in more rural areas.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "experts have suggested a variety of carrots and sticks to draw more customers and insurers into the marketplaces. but, like everything concerning obamacare, there are big political hurdles. for example, more people might buy health insurance if the government subsidies were more generous. but congressional republicans are not about to approve additional spending on a program they already hate. roy says democrats, on the other hand, aren't likely to agree to bigger penalties to punish people who don't buy insurance.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he entered the oval office at just 43, only a few years after khrushchev had threatened to bury america. wars raged around the world. large swaths of the country knew poverty far deeper and more widespread than we see today. a young preacher's cause was just gaining traction against a land segregated not only by custom but by law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and yet in that volatile tinderbox of a time, president kennedy led with a steady hand, diffusing the most perilous moment of the cold war without firing a single shot and forcing the rights of young black men and women to study at the university of their choice. unleashing a corps of young volunteers as ambassadors for peace in distant corners of the globe. setting america's sights on the moon precisely because it was hard, unwilling to consider the possibility that we might not win the space race because he had an unwavering faith in the character of the people that he led: resilient, optimistic, innovative and courageous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's worth remembering this, the times in which president kennedy led us, because for many americans i know that this feels like an uncertain and even perilous time. the forces of globalization and technology have upended many of our established assumptions about the economy. it provided a great opportunity and also a great inequality and uncertainty for far too many. our politics remains filled with division and discord, and everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don't look like us or have the same surnames or pray the way we do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and at such moments, courage is necessary. at such moments, we need courage to stand up to hate not just in others but in ourselves. at such moments, we need the courage to stand up to dogma not just in others but in ourselves. at such moments, we need courage to believe that together we can tackle big challenges like inequality and climate change. at such moments, it's necessary for us to show courage in challenging the status quo and in fighting the good fight but also show the courage to listen to one another and seek common ground and embrace principled compromise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "courage, president kennedy knew, requires something more than just the absence of fear. any fool can be fearless. courage, true courage, derives from that sense of who we are, what are our best selves, what are our most important commitments, and the belief that we can dig deep and do hard things for the enduring benefit of others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's why jfk's first inaugural still rings true. that's why bobby's campaign still means so much. that's why teddy's cause endures, and we still love him so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because of the tragedies that befell each of them, sometimes we forget how fundamentally the story they told us about ourselves changed the trajectory of america. and that's often where courage begins, with the story we tell ourselves about who we are and what's important and about our own capacity to make a difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we live in a time of great cynicism about our institutions. that's one of the few things that democrats and republicans can agree on. it's a cynicism that's most corrosive when it comes to our system of self-government, that clouds our history of jagged, sometimes tentative but ultimately forward progress, that impedes our children's ability to see in the noisy and often too trivial pursuits of politics the possibility of our democracy doing big things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, disdain for elected officials is not new, as many of you in the room can tell others. sixty years ago, president kennedy quoted a columnist in profiles in courage who had written, people don't give a damn what the average senator or congressman says. the reason they don't care is that they know what you hear in congress is 99 percent tripe, ignorance, and demagoguery and not to be relied upon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "which is perhaps a little harsh. ninety-nine percent seems high. eighty-five?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but president kennedy also wrote that the complication of public business and the competition for the public's attention have obscured innumerable acts of political courage, large and small, performed almost daily.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "innumerable acts of political courage large and small performed almost daily. and that is true. i've seen it. i've witnessed it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've been thinking on this notion of political courage this weekend, in particular about some of the men and women who were elected to congress the same year i was elected to the white house. many of them were new to washington, their entire careers ahead of them. and in that very first term, they had to take tough vote after tough vote because we were in crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they took votes to save the financial system and the economy, even when it was highly unpopular. they took votes to save the auto industry when even in michigan, people didn't want to see bailouts. they took votes to crack down on abuses on wall street, despite pressure from lobbyists and sometimes their donors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they found themselves in the midst of a great debate, a debate that had been going on for decades, a debate that the kennedy family had participated in and helped lead: a debate about whether a nation as wealthy as the united states of america would finally make health care not a privilege but a right for all americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there was a reason why health care reform had not been accomplished before. it was hard. it involved a sixth of the economy and all manner of stakeholders and interests. it was easily subject to misinformation and fearmongering.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so by the time the vote came up to pass the affordable care act, these freshmen congressmen and women knew that they had to make a choice. that they had a chance to insure millions and prevent untold worry and suffering and bankruptcy, and even death, but that this same vote would likely cost them their new seats, perhaps end their political careers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and these men and women did the right thing. they did the hard thing. theirs was a profile in courage. because of that vote, 20 million people got health insurance who didn't have it before.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and most of them — and most of them did lose their seats, but they were true to what president kennedy defined in his book as a congressional profile in courage: the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than the desire to maintain office, the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than a desire to maintain office, a conscience, personal standard of ethics, integrity, morality that is stronger than the pressures of public disapproval or party disapproval, a faith that the right course would ultimately be vindicated, a faith that overcame fear of public reprisal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it was a personal sacrifice. but i know, because i've spoken to many of them, that they thought and still think it was worth it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as everyone here now knows, this great debate is not settled but continues. and it is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that regardless of party, such courage is still possible, that today's members of congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth even when it contradicts party positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i hope that current members of congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. but it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm, those who often have no access to the corridors of power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what is politically expedient but doing what they believe deep in their hearts is right. and this kind of courage is required from all of us. those of us who consider ourselves progressives, those of us who are democrats, we've got some soul-searching to do to see what kind of courage we show. we have our own dogmas. those of us not in elected office have to show some courage. and we're prone to bestow the mantle of courage too easily on the prominent and the powerful and then too eager to wrap ourselves in cynicism when they let us down because they weren't perfect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we lose sight sometimes of our own obligations, each of ours, all the quiet acts of courage that unfold around us every single day, ordinary americans who give something of themselves not for personal gain but for the enduring benefit of another. the courage of a single mom who is working two jobs to make sure her kid can go to college. the courage of a small-business owner who's keeping folks on the payroll because he knows the family relies on it, even if it's not always the right thing to do bottom line. the courage of somebody who volunteers to help some kids who need help.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when we recognize these acts of courage, we then necessarily recognize our own responsibility as citizens and as part of the human family to get involved and to get engaged and to take a stand, to vote, to pay attention.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm reminded of a story that teddy once told me about his experiences many years ago when teddy jr., now state senator ted kennedy jr., was sleeping after one of his cancer treatments.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and right there in the quiet of night, working people of modest means and one of the most powerful men in america shared the same intimate and immediate sense of helplessness.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that's what the ordinary courage of everyday people can inspire when you're paying attention, the quiet sturdy courage of ordinary people doing the right thing day in and day out. they don't get attention for it. they don't seek it. they don't get awards for it. but that's what's defined america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kelly: hi. set this up for us. what's the new research?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vedantam: well, people sometimes forget that obamacare is, first and foremost, about insurance. and insurance is really about economics. when you buy car insurance, for example, it doesn't make your car run faster or be more efficient in terms of fuel. but if you get in a car crash, having insurance means you have a financial cushion to deal with any unexpected health or legal issues. so this new study is really asking a very simple question - do we see similar economic outcomes as a result of health insurance as we do with insurance in other domains?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kelly: and i gather the experiment that they're looking at here is set up by the way that different states have implemented obamacare.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "vedantam: (laughter) it is. they analyzed the credit reports of hundreds of thousands of americans. and they used this quirk that you're just referring to, which is obamacare called for an expansion of medicaid. medicaid, of course, is health coverage for poor people. and under the aca, a larger pool of poor people was going to be eligible for medicaid. several states, largely states led by republican leaders who were opposed to obamacare, elected not to expand medicaid. but what this meant is that some states expanded it. some states didn't. and now you have the workings of a natural experiment. here's miller.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sarah miller: not all states adopted the medicaid expansions of the aca as was originally intended in the law. and so we were able to compare - how did these credit market outcomes evolve in states that opted to expand medicaid through the aca and states that chose not to?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kelly: ok. shankar, help us understand that. she said they're measuring credit market outcomes - kind of a wonky term - what does that mean?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vedantam: it is a wonky term. basically, what she was doing is she's look at the likelihood that people have unpaid bills and also have debts that are sent to collection agencies. miller and her colleagues specifically looked at hundreds of zip codes around the country with high numbers of low income people. presumably, these are people who would be affected by a medicaid expansion. these are also people who might have their economic lives upended by a sudden health care emergency. here's miller.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "miller: what we found is that in the states that took up the medicaid expansions, we saw significantly fewer unpaid bills on people's credit reports. and the amount of money that was owed that was in these unpaid bills fell as well.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "vedantam: i think that's exactly right. i mean, obamacare has become this highly partisan and politicized issue. but the researchers here are actually not trying to make a political point. they're just merely establishing that this effect that's widely seen in other domains - having insurance can cushion you against sudden financial losses - is also at work here.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "detrow: first of all, i think that this was kind of a status quo debate. i don't think anything tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates' fortunes. i think one really notable thing is that this evening showed that joe biden has really affected the conversation about health care. for months and months, bernie sanders really set the tone for health care. it was, do you agree with bernie or disagree with bernie? and most candidates said that, yeah, i agree with bernie or at least big chunks of what bernie's trying to do when it comes to medicare for all and in some forms of the going away with private health insurance.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rascoe: what stood out to me was how aggressive joe biden was. and to me, this was one of the first debates where he really seemed to act as if he were the front-runner. in the other ones, especially in that first one, which, i think most people agreed, was not a strong performance for joe biden, he kind of leaned back a bit. but in this one, he was aggressive. there were moments - and really just trying to set the tone instead of just responding.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, he went after bernie sanders when it came to the health care debate, saying, oh you think that once employers don't have to provide health care or aren't providing health care that they're just going to give those savings back to the employers. you know, you say you're a socialist. you have a lot of faith in the private sector. i'm paraphrasing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then also, just when he obviously had that moment in the first debate where he wouldn't go over the time limit, and he said, i'm done. he stopped himself. but in this one, he's like, i'm going for it. everybody else is doing it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keith: one of the areas where he was particularly aggressive on policy was health care. and earlier, we heard a little clip where he made a comparison. you know, you're for bernie. i'm for barack. let's hear a bit more of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: i think we should have a debate on health care. i think - i know that the senator says she's for bernie. well, i'm for barack. i think the obamacare worked. i think the way - we add to it, replace everything that's been cut. add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: and the senator he is referring to is senator elizabeth warren, who supports a version of medicare for all or actually just medicare for all. but when she was asked sort of specifically about, well, what will this mean for middle-class taxes? - she did, you know, a bit of a boxing move and jumped out of the way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "warren: what families have to deal with is cost, total cost. that's what they have to deal with and understand. families are paying for their health care today. families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network. sorry, we are not covering that prescription.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: the question, of course, here was, are you going to raise taxes? and, of course, the answer is inevitably yes. but she is saying, let's look at the total picture. families are going to be better off. their costs overall are going to be lower. and if they are paying a little more in tax, look at the people who are going to be paying a lot more in tax. and let's talk about the big corporations. and let's talk the very richest taxpayers. we're really going to go after them. as for the middle class, well, they'll have to chip in more in taxes, but they'll save so much more in their other costs. that's the pitch.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "elving: it did not work in the long run because while she got a big spike and a lot of people noticed her - and she sold that attack on him on bussing very well, and it was a real vulnerability, too, a long standing vulnerability of joe biden's. so she was really hitting a soft point. this thing tonight seemed a little bit more like a cheap shot, especially given the audience reaction. and so when buttigieg jumped in to be critical of it and to, in a sense, implicitly defend biden...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rascoe: ...that little man behind the curtain.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "detrow: ...a big tivo-er (ph) for sure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rascoe: it seemed like the strategy for this one was, yes, to get trump to maybe notice her (laughter) and strike out at her or - on twitter, but also trying to make this distinction that, look - trump is the person we need to go after. and that's always been the question during these campaigns - like, how much do you want to make it about trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so what she seemed to be trying to say is, we want to beat trump. none of this matters - and i think she did say none of this matters if we don't beat him. and so i'm the person to do that. that's what she was trying to do. of course, people will debate whether it was successful.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keith: i want to turn to beto o'rourke and, more broadly, the issue that he has really taken up since the mass shooting in el paso and dayton and later in west texas. he has made that the centerpiece of his campaign - trying to get gun legislation and making other changes. and in particular, he has gone out farther than many other democrats in the field, calling for not just a ban on new sales of assault-type-style weapons, ar-15s, but a mandatory buyback - basically, taking the guns away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beto o'rourke: and in odessa, i met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an ar-15. and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that ar-15 in odessa and midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. hell yes - we're going to take your ar-15, your ak-47.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: and that's the closest he came to cursing, we should say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: yes. that was his mild cursing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rascoe: this issue of the buybacks is - it's a tricky issue. and it may be why o'rourke is so out on this, and other people may not be joining him - is because npr had a poll - the npr/pbs newshour/marist poll that came out earlier this week. and what they found was that support for actual buybacks is really mixed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so overall, only 45% of people are supporting buybacks. and then - now, democrats do support it more. you have 70% supporting it, republicans 23%. but those independents who you're probably going to want to win - they - only 40% support these buybacks. so this is something where there isn't - outside of the democratic base, there doesn't seem to be widespread support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: even among house democrats - they don't have a clear consensus on anything beyond background checks. they're not really ready to go for an assault weapons ban, even among house democrats looking for what they can get through the judiciary committee and through the house floor. they know they won't get anything through the senate, of course, but just deciding what their unified position is in the house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it's very hard to imagine that this is going to be the cutting edge of the democratic platform next year, but maybe it will. and certainly, incidents of the kind that have been suffered in el paso, so many other cities - midland, odessa in texas just in the last few weeks - have changed the conversation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: but when president trump talks about, oh, those scary democrats, they want to take your guns away, what he's talking about is beto o'rourke and people who would support a mandatory gun buyback.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: and that is going to be a popular view among not only trump republicans but also many independents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: foreign policy is something that we said would come up in this debate and, lo and behold, it did come up in this debate. one of our predictions was correct (laughter).", "augmented": []}

{"original": "elving: well, you know, we just saw the national security adviser fired, and we have just had this extraordinary, phenomenal spectacle of watching the president say, you know, i had a secret meeting coming up at camp david to settle that whole afghanistan war thing, and now i called it off because one of our soldiers got killed. clearly they were going to have to get around to talking a little bit about foreign policy tonight. and they did talk about afghanistan. they did talk, of course, about iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it was another occasion for joe biden to have to do a dance about how he voted for the iraq war, and he called in an authorization for the use of military force, and didn't think it was really going to lead to a war. and we've heard it all before. but it was another moment for biden to be vulnerable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: he was specifically talking tonight about something that he told the npr politics podcast. he had said he had voted for - to authorize the war in order to give president bush leverage but that he had begun to oppose the war the moment that bombs started dropping, the moment that it began. well, that just wasn't true. biden didn't really fully oppose the war until about two years later, and he addressed that discrepancy tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: i said something that was not meant the way i said it. i said from that point on. well, what i always argued against in the beginning once he started to put the troops in was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: so that was iraq. but afghanistan was a larger focus of the conversation in the debate and is more present in a lot of people's minds because of what ron talked about with the president potentially negotiating with the taliban at camp david and then scrapping it. ayesha, they were asked, what would you do? what did they say?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rascoe: well, many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the u.s. to get out of afghanistan - that the war has gone on too long. in particular, warren said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "warren: we need to bring our troops home, and then we need to make a big shift. we cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: and several of the candidates said that as long as we could have the suppression of any terrorist threat to the united states originating in afghanistan - here we are just a few days after the 18th anniversary of 9/11, which was planned and largely put together in afghanistan - as long as we could be assured that that couldn't happen again, and we had the suppression of that kind of terrorist activity, we didn't really need to tell afghanistan what kind of government it was going to have anymore, and we could leave that part of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that seemed to be the basic thrust. pete buttigieg, who has actually served in afghanistan, wanted to make that point and also wanted to say that we shouldn't be looking at any of our troops and telling them that we're not going to stand with them and that we are not going to be committed to the things we send them into the field to die for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: so, as with every debate, there were a lot of things covered. there were also a lot of things that weren't covered. and there are a few stray moments that i feel like we should probably talk about. one of those was vice president biden, in a very long answer about schools and segregation - he started talking about turntables.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: play the radio. make sure the television's - the - excuse me. make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. make sure the kids hear words. a kid coming from a very poor school - a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: so many words - there were so many words.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "detrow: it is a very real point about making sure your kids hear a lot of words, though.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elving: that is a good point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rascoe: although the study that kind of came from - there are, like, questions about that because it said that, like, poor people or people on welfare - their kids hear, like, millions less words, and there's a question about whether that's actually the case. but yes, you should talk to your kids. it's important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keith: yeah. and i narrate everything for my poor children. they - like, their whole lives are, like, one npr politics podcast. and now we're eating bananas - oh, bananas.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "corlette: well, most insurance companies, their business model is based on avoiding risk. they worry that people will wait until they're sick to sign up for coverage. so to protect themselves from that, they came up with a variety of tools that allow them to screen out people who might cost them money. and that includes denying policies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it includes charging a higher premium than they would a healthy person. it could mean that they don't cover certain parts of the benefit package. for example, if you had a history of asthma, they might say, well, we'll cover you but nothing having to do with an upper respiratory condition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chang: right. but it sounds like what you're saying is, this concept of the pre-existing condition, it's an invention by the insurance industry. this is not some medical term from the medical profession. this is an insurance-invented word or idea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chang: so in a way, though, insurers have a point. it is more expensive to cover someone who has an illness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "corlette: yes, that's right. and they do worry that, without certain protections in place, people will not buy coverage when they're healthy and then, you know, when they're in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, they'll call up the insurance company and say, please sign me up for a policy. and if that happens, then the system just doesn't work because premiums will be too expensive and unaffordable for everybody else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chang: ok. but even if the trump administration is successful in ending the affordable care act in the courts, is it politically possible at this point to completely take away protection for pre-existing conditions because it's popular among voters in both parties?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "corlette: right. so if the court rules in favor of the trump administration, these protections will be gone at the federal level. and so congress would have to step in and restore them. unfortunately, we have a pretty divided house and senate, and it's hard to imagine them coming to agreement. that said, interestingly, the number of states have stepped up to try to enact these protections at the state level.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there are limits. for example, states are not allowed to pass laws that affect people with employer-based insurance. that's really a federal responsibility. so states can protect people in the individual market - folks who are buying on their own. but for most of us in employer-based plans, that really would need a federal law change.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here are 5 points to know", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. the political context: health care has emerged as a dominant issue on the campaign trail in the runup to the november elections. according to the wesleyan media project, which tracks congressional advertising, health care was the focus of 41 percent of all campaign ads in september, outpacing taxes (20 percent), jobs (13 percent) and immigration (9 percent). democrats are particularly focused on health care, devoting 50 percent of their ads to the issue, but health care is also a leading issue in republican commercials (28 percent), second only to taxes (32 percent).", "augmented": []}

{"original": "trump's figure was calculated by the libertarian mercatus center, but he fails to note that total health care spending under medicare-for-all would be about $2 trillion less over the decade than currently projected. the federal government would pay more, but americans on the whole would pay less.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "remember that the u.s. already spends far more per person on health care than does any other country. and when you count the tax break for employer-provided insurance, the federal government already pays about two-thirds of this bill. but because of the fragmented private insurance system, the government gets none of the efficiency or buying power that a single-payer system would provide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. health care rationing: trump claims — with no supporting evidence — that the democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care. doctors and hospitals would be put out of business. seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors. there would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures. previously covered care would effectively be denied.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "4. pre-existing conditions: trump notes that as a candidate, he promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions. in fact, trump and his fellow republicans tried — unsuccessfully — to repeal the affordable care act, which guarantees insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. gop plans would leave it up to the states to craft alternative protections. in addition, republican attorneys general have sued to overturn obamacare's protections, and the trump administration has declined to defend them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "npr asked several health care experts to tell us what they view as the biggest problems with the current health care system. then we asked: does the senate bill fix them? most of the experts we consulted (backed up by a congressional budget office assessment) said that for the most part, no — the senate bill won't solve the health care system's problems and that it, in fact, could make some of those problems worse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the biggest problem with health care in the u.s. was around long before obamacare, several experts who spoke to npr said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fundamental problem with the health care system is health care is too expensive, said sara rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at george washington university.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the u.s. spends around $9,450 per person, per year on health care — that is money charged by providers and insurers for services, according to data compiled by the kaiser family foundation. that is around twice as much as in other rich countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we spend so much more than other countries, said larry levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the kaiser family foundation. and while health care costs have been growing relatively modestly recently, they're still growing faster than the economy as a whole.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these bills [from the house and senate alike] don't even really attempt to solve that problem, he said. this is a much narrower effort.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "essentially they're moving the deck chairs on the titanic, concurred sabrina corlette, research professor at the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university. this bill does nothing on cost containment, nothing on delivery system reform, nothing on the underlying reasons that health care is so expensive in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the experts tended to agree that the affordable care act didn't have much success on the cost-containment front, although they disagreed on why.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "health care spending did slow down a lot sort of during aca implementation, but i don't think we can attribute most of that to aca, said caroline pearson, senior vice president for policy and strategy at avalere health. a lot of it had to do with the economy and the state of recession and sort of the hangover that that caused.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the most common criticisms of obamacare right now is that insurers have been dropping out of individual markets set up by the health law. that leaves people in many parts of the country with only one option, and in 2018, 47 counties could have zero insurers, according to the center for medicare and medicaid services.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "opinions vary on how pressing the one-insurer problem is — it's not ideal, but it's not catastrophic having one insurer, said levitt. pearson was more urgent in her warnings: absolutely that needs fixing. the aca exchange markets are very fragile at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "either way, it's not clear that the senate health bill would increase stability in the individual markets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "under current law, the congressional budget office says, the markets will generally hold firm over the coming decade: the subsidies to purchase coverage, combined with the effects of the individual mandate — which requires most individuals to obtain insurance or pay a penalty — are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by enough people, including people with low health care expenditures, for the market to be stable in most areas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, a small number of people live in places with limited participation by insurers. that is due in part to low profits for insurance companies, but it's also due to uncertainty about how health care laws might be enforced in the future — which is created by continual threats to remove the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate bill would not necessarily make more areas more stable. the recent cbo report refers to stability in most places, just as it does to describe the individual marker under current health law: nongroup insurance markets would continue to be stable in most parts of the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but rural areas could have particularly unstable markets under the republican plan, the cbo said. that is because low populations, combined with smaller subsidies, could mean few consumers. that would make exchanges in those areas less profitable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the difference between one law and the other isn't terribly clear in this respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in addition, it's foreseeable that as funding like obamacare's cost-sharing reductions disappear, the markets will get shakier, says one expert.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "between now and 2021, the substantial stabilization funding in the bill would be enough to calm markets even without an individual mandate, said levitt. after that, money then disappears and there's some grant funding to states, but that also diminishes over time. after 2021, it's very likely that insurance markets would look a lot worse under this bill than under aca.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "premiums have climbed sharply in the obamacare markets for a variety of reasons. the senate bill would fix those increases, according to the cbo, but at a price. by 2020, the average premium for a benchmark plan would be 30 percent lower than it would be under obamacare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that sounds good, but those lower premiums wouldn't be enough to entice poorer americans to buy insurance. few low-income people would purchase any plan under this bill, the cbo wrote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that is because the costs would just shift elsewhere. the senate health care plan might push premiums down for some people, but it would also push deductibles up, the cbo said: because nongroup insurance would pay for a smaller average share of benefits under this legislation, most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that was the take of christine eibner, a senior economist and associate director of the health services delivery systems program at the rand corporation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's still going to be more out-of-pocket spending relative to the aca for people with incomes between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, she said. those people are currently eligible for subsidies on the individual exchanges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nicholas bagley, who teaches about health law at the university of michigan, elaborated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by linking subsidies to these less generous plans, the gop health care plan says, 'yes, we're going to make sure you can purchase a plan, but the plans we're going to make sure you can purchase are going to be very high deductible plans,'  he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "not everyone agrees with that assessment, though. avik roy, president of the foundation for research on equal opportunity, has been one of the loudest proponents of the senate's better care reconciliation act. he admits one thing he likes about obamacare is the degree to which it tries to expand the size of the people who try to shop for their own insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate bill further encourages that economically coherent goal, he said, of more people buying insurance on their own in a thriving, robust and stable insurance market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he thinks the individual markets will end up pulling people's health care spending down because new age-rating rules (which make insurance cheaper for younger people relative to older people) and a change that would make marketplace plans, on average, cover less will drive younger and healthier people into the markets, pulling premiums further downward and lowering people's health spending altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by and large, it appears coverage levels would go down under the senate bill, according to the cbo. under that legislation, 22 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 than under current law, the cbo said. nearly 70 percent of that — 15 million — is attributed to medicaid changes. seven million fewer people would be enrolled in the exchanges in that time frame.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there will be a lot of low-income people who won't have access to insurance, and then there will be some who won't be able to buy a plan through the exchanges, said pearson. even if they can afford the premiums, if the deductible is a $6,000 deductible, then that doesn't really leave low-income people in a position to use their insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that is a massive hit to coverage, and it's one of the headline numbers causing republicans the most headaches since the cbo report's release.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "once again, however, roy believes that the cbo is wrong. in his opinion, removing the individual mandate won't drive nearly as many people out of the market as the office says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's a simple way for republicans to highlight the cbo's mandate mania: have cbo score one version of the bill with an individual mandate, and one version without, he wrote. that would show, in his words, that the mandate is the secret sauce driving the cbo's faulty coverage predictions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "depending on whom you ask, the republican plan is solving other problems, though — some of which are not exactly health care-centric.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem it's trying to solve is the republicans didn't like the affordable care act taxes, bagley said. the senate bill gives a massive tax cut, largely for the wealthiest americans, and it finances that tax cut largely by cutting medicaid, the program for low-income americans, he added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nearly 70 percent of the tax cuts that would happen under the senate bill would go to the top 20 percent of earners, according to the tax policy center, and nearly 45 percent would go to the top 1 percent sliver of earners.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "khalid: you know, david, there was a lot of pre-debate chatter about a potential clash between two progressive icons - that's vermont senator bernie sanders and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren. but they did not fight last night. in fact, they tag teamed on progressive policies all night as they fended off attacks from some of the more moderate candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: wow. i just think about some of the issues you were talking about. another that comes to mind is climate change, which is something a lot of democratic voters are passionate about. did that emerge as an issue where there are some divisions?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "khalid: you know, david, i would say, not surprisingly, to some degree, the democrats were fairly in agreement on climate change. it is a top issue, you know, when we look at polling consistently among democratic voters. but the conversation last night really tried to focus and bring it back to jobs and how you address climate change in a really economically feasible way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: one of the really interesting dynamics going into last night was the lineup for last night and then tonight - it's a random draw by cnn. but all of the candidates on stage last night were white, right? and, you know, president trump has really put racial divisions front and center in this campaign recently. so how did an entire field of white candidates deal with issues of race and racism?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "khalid: well, you know, also noteworthy to me, this conversation was happening in detroit. and democrats on the campaign trail talk a lot about how you win back the white house. do you try to persuade centrist voters? or do you really energize the base? - most notably, african americans. and i will say, given the conversation being in detroit, we did not hear extensively about race - even, you know, given the comments that donald trump has made in the last couple of weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the way that the moderators focused the conversation, i was - even the discussion around immigration, was largely through the lens of the concerns of white suburban voters, right? is decriminalizing the border, say, going too far? it was not necessarily through the lens of some of the concerns that i hear from latino voters. that being said, we have a far more diverse field tonight. and so i anticipate we will hear a lot more about racial justice, criminal justice issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: ok. so we heard that there were big divisions on some big issues. let's talk about what some of those divisions are in a little more granular way. npr political reporter danielle kurtzleben was up very late last night but has come back in early this morning, as asma did as well. danielle, good morning.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kurtzleben: ...and now public option is the moderate position...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: the minimum is the government is going to get into the health insurance business more directly. and the question is whether private insurers get to be in the field as well or whether they get knocked out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: there's also a question about trade and tariffs, which, of course, president trump has made a big deal. how are democrats positioning themselves on that issue?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtzleben: it's really impossible to generalize because this is an area where you can have a really big rift among democrats. i mean, the trans-pacific partnership, which, of course, trump has pulled america out of, it's a giant trade deal among - that would have been among 11 nations plus the u.s. - now u.s. no longer. that's something that obama negotiated. last night, you had former maryland rep. john delaney saying he supports it. well, the two people at the center of the stage, bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, were two of the most vocal opponents of that. not only that, but donald trump was a vocal opponent of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtzleben: so if you got one of those two on the debate stage with donald trump, you can imagine that there would have to be some sort of nuanced discussion of, ok, you all - you both opposed tpp. what exactly do you oppose about it and how do you differ?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: the fed is expected to announce it is cutting interest rates. this is a bit unusual. normally, when the economy has grown for years, as it has - we've got about a decade of economic growth - you would expect the fed to be raising rates or holding them steady. recently, though, fed officials have said there are areas of concern in an overall strong economy. lower interest rates would make it cheaper for americans to do things like borrow on their credit cards or take out car loans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "scott horsley, byline: good morning, david.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: all right. so let's talk this through. the fed raised rates as recently as december of last year - not so long ago. so what warning signs are fed officials seeing that might make them go in the opposite direction now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: we're definitely seeing a slowdown in economic growth both here in the u.s. and around the world. just last friday, we learned that the u.s. economy grew at an annual rate of only 2.1% in the spring. that's down from about 3.1% in the first three months of the year. we also learned that last year's economic growth was actually slower than initially reported. at the same time, we're seeing slowing growth overseas, partly as a result of rising trade tensions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and inflation, which is often sort of the boogeyman for the fed, is safely trussed up under the bed. so there's no signal of runaway price hikes. what that means is the fed is ready to goose the economy in an effort to keep this decade-old expansion going a little longer. the fed chairman, jerome powell, has noted that it's only recently that a lot of americans have begun to enjoy the fruits of that expansion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so if the old joke about the fed is they take away the punchbowl just as the party is getting started - powell and his colleagues seem to feel like, you know, there are a lot of thirsty people who've been waiting in line for the punch. let's bring out some more punch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: well, i mean, lower interest rates, i mean, as steve said, can make things cheaper for americans to do stuff. so, i mean, how do consumers in general react to a decision like this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: yeah. it could mean cheaper credit card rates. it could mean cheaper car loans. but here's the thing, david. you know, consumer spending is actually already pretty strong. it's not a lack of consumer spending that's slowing the economy. instead, what we have seen is a drop in things like business investment. and that may or may not respond to such a modest reduction in what are already, you know, very low interest rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: could it actually have a negative impact? i mean, what do some economists see as a negative impact of cutting rates like this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: you know, it could mean lower interest rates for savings - on savings accounts and cds, so it's not so good for people who actually have money in the bank. of course, a lot of big banks are already paying next to nothing on savings accounts. but there are some attractive offers out there. i was looking at some internet banks that were paying north of 2% on savings. and, you know, even if that were to go down by, say, a quarter percentage point, that would still be outpacing inflation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: scott, remind me about president trump's role here. i mean, he's done things that other presidents have not done in terms of his open and very passionate criticism of the fed. how does that all potentially fit into this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: he has been loudly jawboning the fed to cut rates in a big way. he was complaining just yesterday that both the economy and the stock market would be higher still had the fed not raised interest rates on four separate occasions last year. as you say, a lot of presidents in the past have complained quietly and privately about the fed's moves. but president trump has been very vocal...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: no. now, the fed insists they are going to be guided by economic signals, not political pressure. but that said, trump's own trade policies have certainly contributed to slowing economic growth and that, in turn, is prompting the fed to make these moves. so indirectly, the president's having an influence, even if it's not for the reasons he'd like.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sebelius: well, i think, rachel, the aca, in many ways, was on the ballot in 2020. and one of the reasons that vice president biden will be sworn in as the next president of the united states is that people voted for health care. people made it clear over the last 10 years that the aca has been the law of the land, that they don't want to lose their health coverage. they don't want to lose their insurance. and, in fact, americans now, unlike the time when president obama was trying to pass the law, widely believe that preexisting condition should be protected and that all americans deserve health care. that's a huge step forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: at this point, do you think expanding the aca will mean pushing for a public option?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sebelius: well, it's certainly something that i think president biden will propose. he said all during the campaign that that was his plan. it is something that we tried to put in the law 10 years ago. there were not enough democratic votes even though there were 60 democrats in the senate. i think, 10 years later, there's very little question that having a public option as a competitor to the private health plans offered in the marketplace would actually give people a lower-cost choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: i mean, we'll see what happens in the georgia runoffs - right? - in terms of control of the senate. but when it comes to republicans who viewed the public option, as some people called it, a threat to the current health care system, do you think any of those minds have been changed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sebelius: well, i would hope that people have paid attention in the last 10 years. the public option is a choice that people would have between privately offered health plan in the private market and a more government-like plan, which can dramatically lower administrative costs. you know, rachel, we have exactly that same setup in medicare. and what we know is medicare right now can deliver benefit packages at a two to 3% administrative cost. most private insurance companies are in the 15 to 20% level. so you get exactly the same benefits, you're just not paying huge administrative costs. and the dollars can be spent on health care and improving people's health.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: i want to ask you about the case before the supreme court. i mean, this case has democrats, liberals worried that the conservative court would strike down the aca. but even the conservative justices suggested that the case itself isn't strong. what's your response to that? and are you confident the aca, as a result of what the justices are intimating right now, will remain the law of the land?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sebelius: well, i certainly hope they will follow what seems to be the pretty universal sentiment among lawyers who have looked at this case, that it's a very weak case. i hope the supreme court doesn't try to legislate from the bench. congress actually left the law in place as they got rid of the individual mandate. so the law has been in operation for 2 1/2 years since the mandate was gone. the argument that somehow the law can't stand without the mandate has been proven to be false for the last 2 1/2 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: i want to pivot, if i could, and ask you about the state of the pandemic. i mean, you understand the perspective of the federal government as the former secretary of health and human services. you were also a governor. what do you think needs to happen to make sure that, moving forward, there is a more coordinated response between states and the federal government, which has been so lacking for the past nine months?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sebelius: so i think joe biden is doing exactly what governors would expect him to do, starting with clear, scientifically driven communication, a very clear idea that the federal government will gather and distribute protective equipment needed by the states, a very transparent process for mobilizing a national vaccination campaign, an equitable look at how the distribution system will go. then a governor can respond to that plan. but right now, they are really on their own. and i think they will welcome a framework that has been traditionally how we operate in a disaster. the state does whatever they can, but then calls the federal government for help that they can't possibly provide within their own state.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davies: right. and that would be among his core supporters. of course, he's in an election where he needs others. how might this affect the views of others - independents, democrats?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, i think that's a more challenging, you know, question to answer. we have seen some polling suggesting that there is not much trust in the white house when it comes to president trump's health condition and the information being put out. so i do think i agree with you, dave, there - that, you know, this might rally his base and they're going to take to heart what he is saying.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think you do see, out in the real world, a lot of folks support masks. there's widespread support for mask mandates, you know, even across political parties, that this might alienate some folks who are on the fence, who feel like they're living their lives very differently because of the threats of coronavirus and are not seeing the president do the same thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so let's talk about the affordable care act, obamacare, and what remains. you know, in 2017, the penalties associated with the individual mandate were removed, which was, you know, considered a big part of the law. so let's look at what's still standing and what is still in effect. it's still illegal to deny coverage to someone with preexisting conditions. kids can remain on their health care plans until age 26. that all still in effect?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: that is all still in effect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and what about the minimum requirements for health care plans offered on the exchanges? has that changed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: that hasn't changed. but i will say one of the things that has changed is the trump administration has loosened the rules around the sales of what are called short-term health insurance plans. these are plans that typically last less than a year of coverage. and what the trump administration has done differently than the obama administration - it has allowed these plans to exist and not cover the minimum benefits. so this means you could have plans that don't cover prescription drugs, don't cover maternity care. those type of plans were quite common before the affordable care act on the individual market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so we are seeing, you know, while on the marketplace, on healthcare.gov or the state-run marketplaces, all the minimum benefits are required, we are seeing off-marketplace these skimpier plans that might have cheaper premiums but also offer less robust services. those are growing in numbers in terms of what americans are able to purchase.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: yeah. i mean, health care is so confusing and complicated that i could imagine people picking the lower price, not realizing what they're not getting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: exactly. and you do see some pretty aggressive marketing by some of these short-term plans. i mean, i've even received calls on my phone, you know, from folks who are trying to sell me individual insurance. and i often start asking a lot of questions and get hung up on when i start kind of probing into the benefits that they would offer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so - but you could certainly see that happening. and usually you only realize that the benefits aren't what you thought they were when you have some kind of medical need, an emergency, and all of a sudden, you have these bills you didn't expect, and then you really start researching - what is this i purchased? and you realize what you purchased isn't really what you thought it was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: one of the parts of the act which really increased health insurance for a lot of people was the expansion of medicaid, then funded largely by federal subsidies. is that expansion still largely in place?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: it is. it is, and it's growing. one of the things we've seen over the past few years is about a half-dozen states have expanded medicaid via ballot initiatives. republican governors, many remain resistant to medicaid expansion. they don't want to sign up for it. and we've seen a number of grassroots organizers kind of take this question directly to the voters, and when they do, it's quite successful. so just this year alone, both oklahoma and missouri have decided to join the medicaid expansion. and that happened via ballot initiatives; that didn't happen through the legislature.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so one of the things we've really learned over a decade of the affordable care act is it's that expansion of medicaid and expansion of public coverage, that's what's driving most of obamacare's enrollment. it's not the subsidized private plans; it's the free public plans that are bringing a lot of people into coverage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and do states have to cover most of the cost of this now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: they don't. the federal government pays 90% of the costs, and states foot about 10% of the costs. that is a more generous match than what exists in the traditional medicaid program. usually it's closer to 50-50 or 60-40. so it's really a big, enhanced match, and that was a key part of getting the affordable care act passed. the drafters wanted to say to states, this is not going to be onerous on you; you're only going to have to kick in a little bit to get a lot of people covered.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and do we know overall what the fiscal impact of the act is? i mean, a lot more americans are insured than before. is costing us a lot?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, generally, the affordable care act has come in below cost estimates. we've seen the congressional budget office revise downward how much they think the law costs, and that actually comes back to the type of coverage people are getting. enrollment in medicaid is higher than expected. enrollment in the private plans is lower than expected. and medicaid typically pays lower prices to doctors than private insurance plans do. so generally - you know, it obviously costs money to get people covered, but it is costing the federal government less money than was expected when the law was passed a decade ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: we're going to take a break here. let me reintroduce you. we're speaking with sarah kliff of the new york times. she's an investigative reporter who covers the american health care system. we will continue our conversation in just a moment. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(soundbite of slowbern's when war was king)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with sarah kliff. she's been covering the american health care system and national health policy for more than 10 years. she's an investigative reporter for the new york times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the big blow to obamacare was in 2017 when the tax bill was passed. and it eliminated the penalties that were associated with people not getting health insurance, right? the requirement is technically still there, but a zero penalty, so it's lost its teeth. and i think a lot of people thought, uh-oh, because, you know, the whole idea was, if we're going to provide more protection for people with preexisting conditions and all of these other benefits, we've got to get younger, healthier people into the system so that the finances work. what's been the impact on some of those younger, healthier folks staying in or getting in or getting out now that there's no penalty for them declining coverage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, this was something that surprised health economists is they constantly talked about obamacare as - they'd use this analogy of a three-legged stool. and one leg is, you know, getting rid of preexisting conditions - you let everyone in. the other leg is subsidies - you make it affordable. and the third leg is the mandate - you make everyone buy coverage, even people who don't think they need it. and health economists spent, you know, the better part of a decade saying you cut off any leg, and the stool just tumbles over.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and republicans did cut off one of the legs, and it hasn't really tumbled. you know, we just got the health insurance numbers from the census for 2019, which is the first year without the mandate, and there wasn't really any noticeable change. a lot of economists have gone back and kind of no longer think the mandate was quite as important as they initially did when they were drafting the affordable care act. i kind of loved - what one economist told me was that, you know, maybe it's not a three-legged stool. maybe it's kind of like the wobbly table at a restaurant that isn't perfect, but, like, it works, and it does the job you need to do to eat your dinner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the mandate, it turns out, was a kind of weak penalty. the size of it wasn't very big compared to the size of purchasing health insurance. and one of the things i think economists have realized that the subsidies, the things that make insurance affordable on the obamacare marketplace, that's really what got people enrolled, not the mandate to enroll, but the money to make it affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so the idea that young, healthy people would just, you know, roll the dice and go without insurance turns out not to be true. i mean, they realize it's actually something worth doing if you can make it affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: exactly. and a lot hinges on the last thing you said - the if you can make it affordable - that we're seeing, you know, with the way these subsidies are structured, they go up with the cost of health insurance. so if you are someone in the subsidized population, you're always going to have your premium capped at a certain share of your income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it turns out that structure has worked really well. it's made insurance affordable for millions of americans who couldn't afford it before now, whereas, you know, a kind of small mandate, it just wasn't getting the job done. the carrot was good enough that you didn't really need the stick.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so where are we now in the increase of the number of americans insured since the act was passed or, conversely, the decline in those uninsured?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, so we've seen about 20 million americans gain health insurance since the affordable care act was enacted. those numbers were generally going up during the obama administration, and then they've ticked downwards a little bit in the trump administration. we did, like i mentioned earlier, get recent census data last month, which showed health insurance rates were basically holding stable in 2019 after declining a notable amount in 2018. so generally, you know, it fluctuates a little bit year to year. but we're talking about 20 million americans who have health insurance compared to pre-affordable care act times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: republicans have been trying to drive the stake into the heart of obamacare pretty much since it was passed, both through legislation and litigation. and so far, it's standing. but, you know, the health care system's complicated. and if these threats are hovering, i wonder how they have affected the market and the actions of insurance companies and hospitals and others in the system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, it's actually been relatively stable in kind of a surprising way. as you mentioned, you know, obamacare has been under threat since the day it was passed - multiple repeal attempts, multiple supreme court cases, a lot of governors doing what they can to block the law in their states. but the law has actually been relatively stable. we saw some pretty swift premium increases when the marketplaces launched in 2014. those have kind of petered out a little bit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, usually each year, there's about nine to 10 million people who buy coverage on the marketplaces. that number might increase significantly this year with people losing their coverage that came along with the jobs they used to have before the pandemic. but it's been surprisingly stable. it surprised me. it surprised a lot of sources that i talked to, given all these efforts to take the affordable care act down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so let's talk about this court case, which is going to be argued a week after the election. the caption on the case is california v. texas. who are the plaintiffs in this case? what's their argument for knocking down obamacare?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. so it's a little confusing because the plaintiffs in this case are actually the ones defending the affordable care act. so why don't i tell you about the challengers to the affordable care act and kind of what they are arguing? so the challengers is a group of republican attorneys general. and they are making a two-part argument that's a little complex, but i'll do my best to try and summarize that. it all starts with this 2017 tax bill we talked about earlier that dropped the individual mandate penalties to zero dollars. they make the argument that without a tax, without a number attached to it, the mandate is unconstitutional. if you remember back to the 2012 decision that upheld the individual mandate, the supreme court ruled there that it was constitutional because of the federal government's taxing powers. they say no tax, now it's unconstitutional. so that's the first part in their argument. the second part is really what the case hinges on. they argue that the mandate is so key to the affordable care act. it's such a crucial part of the law that if the court finds the mandate to be unconstitutional, it needs to strike the rest of the law down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in legal terms, they are saying that the individual mandate is inseverable from the rest of the affordable care act and that if a court finds the mandate unconstitutional, that everything - the protections on preexisting conditions, the medicaid expansion, you know, really far-off provisions like requirements to post calorie labels in restaurants - all of that needs to fall if the mandate is unconstitutional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right. you know, that argument that if one part falls, the rest of it must fall just always struck me as more of a debating point than a legal argument. i guess the connection to the constitution is to the taxing authority of congress here, huh?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: it is. so it all kind of comes back to the taxing authority of congress. and i think there are, you know, some liberal legal scholars who say, you know, maybe that first part of the argument is right. you know, maybe there really isn't a case for upholding the mandate anymore, but it's kind of a so what of it at this point. the penalty is zero dollars. having the mandate struck down as unconstitutional really wouldn't change obamacare much one way or another. the real question of this case sits on this question of severability, of if the court decides that they are not going to sever the mandate from the rest of the law, i mean, that's - that would be a huge, huge deal to pull the affordable care act out of the health care system after it spent a decade kind of integrating into all of our lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right. and to just get a little technical for a moment, i mean, this idea that one part of a law - the invalidation of one part of a law invalidates all of a law. surely that issue comes up in many, many different kinds of legislation at every level. this is a new issue?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: no, no, it's definitely not a new issue. and it's come up recently in the supreme court. and it's actually given defenders of the affordable care act some hope that the affordable care act will survive, given how conservative justices have written on it. there's an opinion that came out earlier this year written by justice kavanaugh that deals with this issue of severability and it feels quite pertinent to the affordable care act case, where justice kavanaugh, you know, really advocates for a narrow interpretation of severability, saying, you know, that they should not be trying to strike down entire laws based on tiny portions. so that kavanaugh opinion from earlier this year, it kind of gives us some insight into how he thinks about the severability issue, which, like you mentioned, is not new. it's just going to get a lot more attention with this affordable care act case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right. now, of course, this case comes at a particularly interesting time because, you know, president trump and the republicans are trying to get judge amy coney barrett approved by the senate and sworn in before the case is heard. what effect might that have?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so interestingly, you know, i spent some time reporting on this a few weeks ago, and most of the folks i talked to actually don't think there will be a big impact on this case. they were generally expecting this case not to succeed at the supreme court and were even raising the possibility of a 9-0, 8-1 decision against this challenge. one thing to know about this court challenge is a lot of the legal scholars who have supported previous obamacare challenges think the argument is very weak, especially that jump from the first part to the second part, this idea of saying the mandate is not severable is kind of an overreading of what congress meant to do when they zeroed out those penalties. so, you know, when i've interviewed folks who follow the court closely, they actually don't think it'll make a big difference in this case. and they also look at the writings of some conservative justices, particularly justice kavanaugh on severability, and think that they might be inclined to uphold the affordable care act in this particular challenge. that being said, you know, the supreme court is unpredictable. we're in unpredictable, unknown times. so anything could happen. but the bright minds i have talked to do not think this particular case is especially affected by that change in who is holding the seat on the court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: we're going to take another break here. let me reintroduce you. we're speaking with sarah kliff. she's an investigative reporter for the new york times covering the american health care system. we will continue our conversation after this short break. i'm dave davies, and this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(soundbite of hutchinson andrew trio's mintaka (feat. donny mccaslin))", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in today for terry gross. we're speaking with sarah kliff, an investigative reporter for the new york times who covers the american health care system. we're talking about campaign debates over insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions and the latest legal challenge to the affordable care act, which will be argued before the u.s. supreme court next month.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, president trump has said and, according to your writing, his core followers believe that he is committed to preserving health insurance for people with preexisting medical conditions. democrats say that if you look at what trump's actually doing, that the administration is in court specifically trying to strike down those protections. are they right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: sort of. mostly. so i would say, generally, when you look at president trump's record, it is not one of trying to uphold protections from preexisting - for americans with preexisting conditions. it starts with support for repealing the affordable care act, which created those protections, and a number of plans circulated by republicans that would not continue those protections, despite some statements they made about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then it really continues up through this legal challenge where, you know, it is not the trump administration itself that is suing, but the justice department did file a brief over the summer that supported the challenge and said that it also agreed that protections for preexisting conditions should fall if the mandate is ruled unconstitutional. so i do not think it is accurate to say, as president trump repeatedly does say, that he is for protecting preexisting conditions. what we know of his policy record, his administration's litigation record, is that they've done a number of things that would erode those consumer protections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and i guess what they would say is, well, once it's gone, we'll come up with something that's better. it's not just repeal; it's repeal and replace. what does the record show about the likelihood of that happening?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, it's funny you mention that because, you know, i remember when president trump was inaugurated - or right before his inauguration, he started saying there was going to be a health care plan, and all the health reporters were kind of, you know, jittering to see it. like, oh, what's the trump plan? what's the trump plan? and we just - you know, we're four years out from that, and we just have not seen a plan. the white house constantly promises that a new plan is coming. they've done that in recent weeks. and then it just doesn't turn up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obviously, it could at some point. but if you look at the past four years, it's a lot of promising from the white house that there is going to be a plan; it's going to do as well as obamacare at protecting preexisting conditions. but so far, no one has seen that plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: there were some congressional initiatives - right? - to provide some kind of an alternative while repealing obamacare, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: there were. there were. and none of them, you know, had the same protections for preexisting conditions that you see in the affordable care act. so, you know, sometimes you'd see things like, well, of course, we're going to protect preexisting conditions for americans with continuous coverage - meaning, you know, if you stay insured, if you never have an uninsured month, then insurance companies can't deny you. but that obviously leaves out someone who has a gap in coverage - or, you know, they'd say we're going to require insurance companies to accept people with preexisting conditions but get rid of the obamacare requirements that bar them from charging those people more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you did see some steps towards protection that were, you know, further beyond what existed before obamacare, but you did not see those plans matching the protections that exist in current law because of the affordable care act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you know, the act also included a number of measures that were designed to reduce costs in the health care system - you know, reimbursements for hospitals for medicare patients, those kinds of things. are they still in effect?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: they are still in effect. you know, the administration is still running a number of programs, and these ones tend to be less political. they're not really the focus of the debate. but those generally are still in effect. i'd say they have a mixed track record - some of them more successful than others in reducing costs. but those parts of the affordable care act continue through this day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: the president did sign an executive order recently which established as policy that the administration favors the preservation of insurance for people with preexisting conditions. what did that provide?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: i mean, it provided a nice photo op to sign the executive order. but in terms of what that actually changes policywise, the answer is nothing. you know, that's just not how laws work in the united states. they have to go through congress. and with the health care system as complex as the united states, you know, it's not really about signing a piece of paper saying, we protect preexisting conditions; it's about actually writing the rules for how insurance companies have to act and spelling out what that means.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so let's say the supreme court, you know, rules in favor of the challengers; it says all of obamacare is unconstitutional. that executive order is not going to do anything to keep obamacare's preexisting condition protections on the books.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: this is an issue in the fall campaign, and democrats are really talking a lot about protecting protections for people with preexisting conditions. and they managed to get a vote in the senate on a bill, which had no chance of passing, but which would have, in effect, barred the trump administration from continuing its intervention in this case to strike down the affordable care act. what happened there?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, i think, broadly, what you see happening in the two political parties is a big role reversal. you know, if you look back at the conventions in 2012 and 2016, republicans loved to talk obama - about obamacare. they were constantly talking about obamacare repeal and getting rid of the law and how terrible it was. and now flash-forward to 2020 and republicans are not really saying much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i watched most of the republican convention and, you know, did a story about this, that obamacare was mentioned just once the entire republican convention, whereas democrats are quite enthusiastic to talk about it. they want to talk about preexisting conditions. they want to talk about repeal in a way republicans no longer do. and i think that's what you see with this senate vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "heading into the election, particularly with the supreme court battle ahead of us, democrats are quite, quite eager to make health care a big issue over the next few weeks. and, you know, you see that in the senate vote. you see that in the first presidential debate, where joe biden immediately starts talking about the affordable care act and preexisting conditions when the debate opens. you know, it's an issue democrats want to talk about in a way that was not true, you know, in the last two election cycles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: it kind of reminds me of - you know, social security and medicare were really controversial when they were passed, but at some point, they become, you know, just a part of the infrastructure and accepted and embraced by just about everybody.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah, i think you're right. this is kind of what we see with social welfare programs. i will say, for medicare, medicaid, social security - they did not face quite the blowback that the affordable care act did. you know, they were accepted a bit quicker than what we're seeing with the affordable care act, which, you know, as we've already discussed, is still facing a lawsuit in the supreme court to overturn it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but in general, you know, it becomes a lot harder to repeal this, and you saw this in the 2017 repeal effort. it's so much harder to repeal a law that covers millions of americans than it is to - you know, trying to stop it while it's being drafted. this is a really tangible benefit to a number of people. and it would be quite noticeable to them if that benefit were taken away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: yeah, it's interesting that while, you know, national republicans in an election year are not talking about this stuff much, i mean, there are 20 republican attorneys general who are generally elected - right? - they're politicians - and they were prepared to go to court and try and knock obamacare out. is there an incentive among their supporters or donors here? i mean, does it - is it a matter of some of these taxes? or - why does it still get energy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, that is something that continues to puzzle me to this day is why pursue this challenge? you know, it seems like - i am not a political strategist. but just, you know, from writing about the issue, it seems like a big liability to have this case on preexisting conditions coming just days after the election. i will say one thing that's a bit different about this challenge than previous challenges is it's not generally supported by a lot of the mainstream conservative legal community. this kind of came up more from the fringe and then proved quite successful in lower district courts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, you know, at the same time, like you said, there's 20 attorney generals who signed onto it. so it's not like this is totally out of left field. it's getting some support from kind of the - from very important figures within the party. and i don't fully understand the political calculation around it, why you would want to be pursuing this kind of supreme court case in an election year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: one other issue, you know, the president says he's done an awful lot to fight high prescription drug costs. has he?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: you know, this is another one where we kind of see a lot of talk about it. and we saw an executive order last week that's signed at the same time as the executive order around preexisting conditions. but we actually haven't seen much policy movement on the topic. president trump, you know, does like to claim drug prices are lower. he said at the last presidential debate that insulin is now as cheap as water, which any diabetic would tell you is not true. insulin is much more expensive than water, much more expensive in the united states than other countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but - so we haven't really seen much movement. it's clearly an area of focus for the president. he talks about it a lot. and when you ask americans about, you know, what sort of health care issues they're dealing with, drug prices often comes up as the kind of most frustrating - medical bills they're receiving. but we actually haven't seen much policy movement that would lower those drug prices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right. there were some negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry which didn't yield an agreement, right? and then the president talked about issuing $200 voucher or cards to older americans - right? - soon, this fall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. so we're still waiting to see what is going to happen with those cards, if they actually exist or not. there are certainly some questions about the legality of sending out $200 vouchers to a number of voters in the weeks leading up to an election. they claim they have authority under certain waiver rules that allow them to test out new programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think, you know, if they do actually move forward on sending those out, you might see them challenged in court. so we don't know what's going on with those vouchers. they were mentioned a few weeks ago. but, you know, in the past week or so, we have not heard anything about them. obviously, there's been a lot going on with the president in the past week or so that might overshadow that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kliff: yeah. you know, in most situations, it is. but there's also a lot of people who are facing surprise medical bills due to their coronavirus testing and treatment. we've worked with some data companies. and we estimate that about 2.4% of americans face some kind of charge that they have to pay for their coronavirus test, despite the requirement that insurance companies fully cover them. and, you know, that number might seem small. but keep in mind, there's been 108 million coronavirus tests in the united states. so when you start doing the numbers, 2.4% of that is actually millions of americans facing some kind of bill for coronavirus tests. you know, i'm just starting to get further into understanding the costs of coronavirus treatment. and, again, they're - you're starting to see patients who are getting bills they didn't expect for, you know, treatment that they thought was going to be covered by their insurance company.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kliff: yeah. so you definitely see - one of the things, i think, that's pretty common in these surprise bills is a situation you mentioned where someone goes to a doctor's office or an emergency room for a coronavirus test, and the coronavirus test is covered by the insurance company, but something else that happened is not covered. sometimes, that's an emergency room facility fee, kind of the price of going to an emergency room, which i've seen emergency rooms applying to drive-through sites. people don't actually enter the emergency room, but they still receive the facility fee for driving through and getting their tests there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've seen a number of providers tacking on flu tests or, in some even more egregious examples, std tests that patients, you know, they just thought they were getting a drive-through coronavirus test. and now, they see a dozen or so different items from the lab that they were billed for, some of them the insurance is not required to cover. so it just - it's really hard to know. and patients typically only find out, you know, what was tacked onto their bill when they get the charges in the mail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you know, health care treatment is very private. and health insurance companies aren't exactly dying to share data about this. how do you find out what people are paying for these bills?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: so i find out by asking readers to send me their bills. it sounds like a kind of insane way to investigate this. but, you know, i found, with some previous work i did on emergency room billing, that the best way to understand what patients are being charged is to actually see the billing documents themselves. insurance companies and hospitals typically keep those numbers secret. they do not want to share them. they do not publish some list of their charges. so i get my information from what patients are willing to send me and, in this case, what they're willing to send me for their coronavirus testing and treatment bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so if somebody wants to send you their bills, what do they do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: they just go to a very simple url - nytimes.com/costofcare. there's a really easy way just to upload a picture or a pdf or whatever you have - a screenshot of your bill. and it would be such a huge help to the work i'm doing trying to understand the costs of this disease.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so what are you going to be focusing on the next few months?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: well, you know, i think - like a lot of my colleagues - i'm focused a little bit on the election and what are going to be the consequences for health care, you know, depending on who wins. we'll have the supreme court case we talked about coming up on november 10, and an eventual decision on that is going to be a pretty big deal. and then the other thing is, you know, understanding the billing experience that patients are having due to coronavirus. i'm trying to understand - i know a lot about testing now, but i know less about treatment, and i'd like to understand that better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then i think - you know, big-picture, zooming out a little bit - you know, one of the things we haven't talked as much about lately is that the health care system lost a lot of money due to coronavirus, due to all that canceled and delayed care. and how does it react to that? do we see hospital closures? do we see new fees being tacked on to doctor visits? i'm pretty interested in how the health care system deals with this reality of losing a lot of money in 2020.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kliff: yeah, it's hard to know. and i think it's going to take, you know, a few years to really understand the consequences of all this missed preventative care. i think we're going to learn a lot about how necessary or unnecessary that care is based on what happens in this experience. and that is one of the things i do think a number of primary care experts worry about - is that all this skipped care might lead to more breast cancer deaths, more colon cancer deaths. but these are kind of the ripple effects we're going to have to wait months or even years to fully understand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: i'm wondering if - kind of what macro impacts you might be seeing in the health care system from the pandemic - i mean, rural health care being degraded as opposed to urban health care; you know, some hospitals making it, others not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kliff: yeah. i think, generally, what you see is that the hospitals that were well-positioned and quite wealthy before the coronavirus pandemic are having an ok time weathering the storm. they had reserves and could survive something like this, whereas those that were, you know, already running tight margins, running a loss - and when i think of those, i think of rural hospitals, hospitals serving urban, low-income populations - those are the ones that, you know, you worry about having to close or having to cut off certain service lines that cost them more money to run.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the one area i worry about the most is, really, primary care because you've seen their revenue just decimated as americans put off a lot of the preventive care that is, you know, typically delivered at their doctor's office. they were already, you know, some of the less-profitable, lower-margin type of doctor offices we have in the united states, and now with this big hit to their business, i am concerned about the strength of that part of our health care system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in the end, after days of highly dramatized deliberation, president trump had to choose. he had to choose not only between several possible nominees for the supreme court, but also between categories of advisers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in this case, he chose to listen to his lawyers rather than his talk show hosts. and he did not seem overly concerned about the warning senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had issued over the weekend about which prospective nominees would be easiest to get confirmed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the man the president finally summoned to the stage in the east room of the white house on monday night was brett kavanaugh, whom many considered the front-runner to replace justice anthony kennedy even before kennedy had announced his retirement. kavanaugh was once a clerk for kennedy, overlapping briefly with neil gorsuch, the man president trump made his first choice for the supreme court last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this time around, kavanaugh was the lead horse, the candidate with the glittering resume and the inside track. as a double yalie, he would keep intact the current domination of the court by just two law schools: harvard and yale (gorsuch went to harvard). he also has the longest and most distinguished record of service as a federal appellate judge among the four finalists announced by the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kavanaugh has written a lot of important decisions, because he serves on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, often called the little supreme court for its docket of administrative and constitutional cases and its history of sending its alumni to the high court across the street from the capitol.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all this mattered to the man who has run the vetting process for trump's judicial nominees, white house counsel don mcgahn, who was joined by other prominent legal minds within the gop. they led the president to follow once again the conventional script for appointing conservative republicans to the supreme court, finding the name on his famous list of 25 that pleased him while checking off the maximum number of boxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the list, of course, came from the federalist society and its leader, leonard leo, with input from other conservative organizations. it played an enormous role in trump's 2016 election, reassuring a whole category of religious conservatives that trump would appoint a court that would overturn roe v. wade and do it automatically, as he promised in his third presidential debate against hillary clinton.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet in kavanaugh, trump chose someone who might well have been chosen by president george w. bush (for whom kavanaugh worked as staff secretary in the white house, helping to choose his supreme court nominees) or by the elder president bush, or ronald reagan. trump even paid homage to reagan in his introductory remarks, saluting the gipper for putting kennedy on the court three decades ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with all these credentials, kavanaugh still met resistance within trump world. longtime association with the bush family is not generally a plus in the president's realm, nor is the sense that kavanaugh might surprise once he has reached the ultimate level of independence on the court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "critics have complained that the hundreds of thousands of pages and emails and everything else kavanaugh has produced will slow the confirmation process and perhaps complicate the vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "besides, kavanaugh was not the exciting, breakout, populist, anti-establishment pick some on the right had wanted and expected. when presented with a chance to vote against obamacare from his perch on the appeals court a few years ago kavanaugh chose an off-ramp to avoid a strong opinion. when he was a prosecutor working for independent counsel ken starr in the late 1990s, he concluded that former white house counsel vince foster had not been murdered (as countless conspiracy theorists maintained). and there are surely other jurists out there who have worked harder to establish their bona fides with the far right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moreover, there were boomlets in the last few days for other prospective nominees. thomas hardiman of the pennsylvania circuit, the runner-up to gorsuch, was still presumed the favorite of his former colleague maryanne trump barry, the president's sister. and raymond kethledge of michigan was, with hardiman, one of the two prospects mcconnell thought it would be easiest to confirm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so there was uncertainty right up until curtain time at the white house on monday night, the culmination of the latest production by trump the showman. given a rather predictable nominee to present, trump managed through days of interviewing and sending mixed signals to create an atmosphere of suspense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "remarkably, the usually leaky white house operation managed to preserve the secret right up to the moment of the big reveal at 9 p.m., allowing speculation and campaigning and contesting of the nomination throughout the final day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that meant cable tv and twitter were teeming with such prominent and influential talk show personalities as radio host steve deace in iowa and sean hannity on fox news, voicing their fervent support for amy coney barrett, an indianan serving on the u.s. circuit court of appeals in chicago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "conservative media stars such as erick erickson, former ceo of redstate.com, were rhapsodizing about what a barrett pick would mean to them. erickson, who has been hot and cold on trump, said he'd vote for him in 2020 despite the tariffs and other disagreements if the president opted for the former notre dame law professor, who has become something of a joan of arc for social and religious conservatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hannity, who communicates with the president daily and seems at times his alter ego, also made no secret of his preference for barrett. so he may have been giving a little bit away when he appeared on fox's the five on monday evening. hannity told fox viewers to close their eyes just before trump revealed his choice so they could imagine who the new justice might be if hillary clinton were president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "of course, by the time kavanaugh was official and the reactions were pouring in, the barrett fans were mostly climbing on board — despite their earlier reservations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they really had little choice. the atmosphere in the east room of the white house on monday night was celebratory and relieved. trump himself delivered a brief tribute to justice kennedy, and well he might. for by retiring just now, kennedy has given the president the ultimate political gift — the chance to change the subject, reprise his greatest hit (the gorsuch nomination) and shape the political debate in the months leading into the november midterm elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "not so long ago, trump and the gop had hoped to ride their tax bill to popularity this year. but the public has remained largely indifferent (or even hostile) to their signature legislation. trump's get-tough tariff regime has induced anxiety among farmers and manufacturers and may soon worry workers as well. the zero tolerance policy at the southern border has produced heart-rending visuals and a genuine crisis over families of asylum seekers separated and imprisoned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the crown jewel of a peace process with north korea seems to be falling apart before actually achieving anything for the u.s. and the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election continues apace, with 19 indictments so far and trump's former campaign manager sitting in jail awaiting trial.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet now, with the kavanaugh confirmation process underway, trump can hearken back to gorsuch. no other action trump has taken to date has so consistently pleased his base, the party and the broader conservative movement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as to resistance from the other side of the political aisle, the objections from democrats and their constituency groups arrived at least as fast as the praise from the right. but in the end, having some of the talk show hosts and other firebrands a little disappointed by the pick may help trump and mcconnell prevail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "having chosen a candidate who will unite nearly all conservatives, trump and mcconnell can now focus on winning over a few democrats. and kavanaugh is not a naturally divisive personality, but a rather personable and presentable fellow with many friends, a charming family and a lifelong active church life. (like the other three finalists, he is a catholic.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some democrats will still see kavanaugh as they did a decade or so ago, as a combatant in some of the worst moments of partisan warfare in recent decades. he was a lawyer in the bush v. gore case that decided the 2000 election, and before that, a lawyer with the investigation that led to the impeachment of president bill clinton in 1998.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when bush first appointed kavanaugh to the federal bench, the democrats held up his nomination for years. sen. charles schumer of new york said naming kavanaugh to the bench wasn't just throwing salt in the wound, it was throwing in the whole shaker. kavanaugh was re-appointed in 2006 and confirmed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in those days, we should note, the minority party could filibuster or threaten to filibuster a presidential nominee. that ended when the democrats, as the majority, decided to eliminate the filibuster on presidential nominees for all but the supreme court. in 2017, mcconnell killed the filibuster for supreme court nominations as well. thus gorsuch was confirmed with 54 votes, and kavanaugh can be confirmed with as few as 50.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schumer has said he will again oppose kavanaugh with everything i have. but he does not seem to have much at this point, barring a defection from the gop side. kavanaugh has not said or written anything showing hostility to roe v. wade, which was the line drawn in the sand by sen. susan collins of maine, one of two senate republicans to have defended abortion rights. but as a name on the list of 25 from the federalist society touted by trump in 2016, he would have to have impressed some experts as a jurist who might well overturn roe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "advice for navigating a patchwork system", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it helps to understand how the system works as you set out to get the vaccine. here are some tips to keep in mind as you proceed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. first, understand the big picture. as you try to navigate the vaccine system in your state, be aware that there are multiple points of entry for those seeking a vaccine. although the federal government pays for and distributes the vaccines, it's up to state and local health departments and the private sector — hospitals, clinics and pharmacies — to actually schedule and give out the shots.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in many states, the different systems don't talk to one another. so when it's your turn to get signed up for a shot, you may need to look for available appointments in all three of these separate streams, depending on your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. keep an eye on pharmacies. in addition to sending vaccines to states, the government is sending vaccines directly to chain pharmacies through the federal retail pharmacy program, which launched in early february.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "find out which pharmacies in your area are giving out vaccines by using the cdc's vaccinefinder tool, which launched feb. 24. vaccinefinder is designed to show up-to-date information about which local pharmacies have doses in stock, and you may be able to book an appointment online, directly with the pharmacy, if you're eligible in your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in most states, this tool only shows pharmacies that get vaccine directly from the federal government so there may be additional pharmacies with vaccine — check your state in our tool for ways to search for those. in alaska, indiana, iowa and tennessee, you can see the complete list of providers using vaccinefinder, and more states are expected to include complete lists in the coming weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. remember the vaccine is free. you can get it if you don't have insurance. if you are insured, your insurance is required to cover the costs of administering the shot. make sure to have your health insurance info handy in case when looking for an available slot in case that information is needed to register.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. be patient and persistent. there are not enough doses available right now for people who are currently eligible and demand is generally high, so you might have to persevere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it can certainly be frustrating: hotlines can be jammed. sign-ups can fill up the minute they open. providers don't always schedule second doses, leaving people who succeeded in getting an initial appointment to scramble to set up their second dose within the recommended window.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even insiders are struggling with the chaotic system. claire hannan, who runs the association of immunization managers, could barely figure out how to get a shot for her dad in maryland. he's on the pre-registered waiting list for our county since jan. 15, and we haven't heard one thing, she says. who could possibly be ahead of him? he's 95! (she was ultimately able to get him vaccinated in another county.)", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the vaccine distribution patchwork is not easy to fix because it's a reflection of the patchwork health care system, a mix of public providers like health departments and private providers like hospitals and clinics that don't always play nice together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i can't tell you how complicated it is to have a federally financed vaccine being distributed through a state-based system, with a health care system that's private-sector based, hannan says. these three things are completely separate and operate in their own kingdoms. so, trying to marry all of this and to track it in real time with data connections? it's incredible that we are where we are.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a central promise of the biden administration was to offer more assertive federal leadership over the covid-19 public health response. recently, officials have acknowledged the confusion and promised they're looking at various options for something more clear and centralized.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the launch of the cdc-backed vaccinefinder to help people find providers near them with vaccine in stock is helpful, but doesn't solve the sign-up problem — people still need to reach out to each clinic or pharmacy individually to try to book an appointment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in all likelihood, the patchwork of public and private sign-up systems will continue. at this point, it's probably too late in the game to set up a system to connect everything, hannan says. so it's really almost better to just communicate to people: 'here's where the vaccine's going and here's what you need to do.' [right now,] we're not even doing a great job of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is worth noting: the patchwork might not be pretty, but people are getting vaccinated — more than 66 million doses have gotten into people's arms so far. more than a million shots are given on average every day across the country.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but most republicans i've talked to say although he's - has been hurt in the short run, his approval ratings have gone down - in the long run, if he can still show his base that he's fighting for the wall, he can come out of this. this is still very early in the 2020 cycle, and we have seen in the past a shutdown's political effects can evaporate. in 2013, the republicans shut down the government, took a huge hit. and then that story was completely forgotten when the obamacare website debuted and crashed. so the - i guess the best thing for the president is that this happened very early in this year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the health law's subsidies to individuals buying insurance and the medicaid expansion are funded by two big pots of money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first is a series of taxes, including levies on individuals with incomes greater than $200,000, health insurers, makers of medical devices, brand-name drugmakers, people who use tanning salons, and employer plans that are so generous they trigger the much-maligned cadillac tax. some of those measures have not yet taken effect.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but those savings — even if republicans could find a way to apply them to a new bill — wouldn't be enough to fund the broad expansion of coverage offered under the aca.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this is not a time one wants to disrupt the employer marketplace, klein said in an interview. it seems perplexing to think that if the aca is going to be repealed, either in large part or altogether, it would be succeeded by a proposal imposing a tax on people who get health coverage from their employer.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here are some key details that can help put the current political arguments in perspective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pre-existing conditions are previous or ongoing medical issues that predate health insurance enrollment. the problem is that the term is a grab bag whose limits have never been defined. it certainly applies to serious ongoing conditions such as cancer, heart disease and asthma. but insurers also have used it to apply to conditions like pregnancy or far more trivial medical issues such as acne or a distant history of depression.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the kaiser family foundation estimated in 2016 that more than a quarter of adults younger than 65 — about 52 million people — have a pre-existing health condition that very likely would have prevented them from purchasing individual health insurance under the pre-aca rules. (kaiser health news is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "protections vary by the kind of insurance you have", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what protections people with pre-existing conditions have depends on how they get their coverage. for that reason, it's not right to say everyone with health problems is potentially at risk, as democrats frequently suggest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, medicare, the federal health program for seniors, and medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income people, don't discriminate in either coverage or price on the basis of pre-existing conditions. the two programs together cover roughly 130 million americans — nearly a third of the population.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the majority of americans get their coverage through work. in 1996, congress protected people with pre-existing conditions who have employer-based coverage by passing the health insurance portability and accountability act, known as hipaa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hipaa was intended to eliminate job lock, or the inability of a person with a pre-existing condition (or a family member with a pre-existing condition) to change jobs because coverage at the new job would most likely come with a waiting period during which the condition would not be covered.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hipaa banned those waiting periods for people who had maintained continuous coverage, meaning a break of no more than 63 days, and the law limited waiting periods to one year for those who were previously uninsured. in addition, it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to or raising premiums for workers based on their own or a family member's health status or medical history.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hipaa was less successful in protecting people without job-based insurance. it sought to guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions leaving the group market could buy individual coverage if they had remained continuously covered. but the law did not put limits on what individual insurers could charge for those policies. in many cases, insurers charged so much for these hipaa conversion policies that almost no one could afford them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the affordable care act, passed in 2010, built on those 1996 protections and specifically sought to help people buying their own coverage. it barred all health insurers from excluding people because of pre-existing conditions, charging them higher premiums and imposing waiting periods for coverage of those conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while the protections were mostly aimed at the individual insurance market, where only a small portion of americans get coverage, the aca also made some changes to the employer market for people with pre-existing conditions, by banning annual and lifetime coverage limits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "will protections on pre-existing conditions become collateral damage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2017, the gop-controlled house and senate voted on several versions of a bill that would have dramatically overhauled the aca, including its protections of pre-existing conditions. under the last bill that narrowly failed in the senate, states would have been given authority to allow insurers to waive some of those protections, including the one requiring the same premiums be charged regardless of health status.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in february, 18 gop attorneys general and two gop governors filed suit in federal court in texas. they charge that because congress in its 2017 tax bill eliminated the aca's penalty for not having insurance, the entire federal health law is unconstitutional. their argument is that the supreme court upheld the aca in 2012 based only on congress' taxing power, and that without the tax, the rest of the law should fall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration, technically the defendant in that case, said in june that it disagreed that the entire law should fall. but it is arguing that the parts of the law addressing pre-existing conditions are so tightly connected to the tax penalty that they should be struck down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clearly, if the lawsuit prevails in either its original form or the form preferred by the trump administration, pre-existing protections are not safe, as the president claimed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even more complicated, the protections written into hipaa were rewritten and incorporated into the aca, so if the aca in whole or part were to be struck down, hipaa's pre-existing condition protections might go away, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "republicans in congress have introduced a series of proposals they say would replicate the existing protections. but critics contend none of them cover as many situations as the aca does. for example, a bill unveiled by several republican senators in august would require insurers to offer coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions, but not require coverage of the conditions themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that hasn't stopped republicans from claiming that they support protections for pre-existing conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "make no mistake about it: patients with pre-existing conditions should be covered, says wisconsin gop senate candidate leah vukmir, who is running to unseat democratic sen. tammy baldwin. health care has been a major issue in that race, as well as many others. yet vukmir was recently hailed by vice president pence as someone who will vote to fully repeal and replace obamacare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, democrats who are chastising their republican opponents over the issue are sometimes going a bit over the top, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "an example is manchin's claim about the threat to coverage for 800,000 people in west virginia. west virginia's population is only 1.8 million and more than 1 million of those people are on medicare or medicaid. that would mean every other person in the state has a pre-existing condition. a recent study found west virginia has a relatively high level of pre-existing conditions among adults, but it is still less than 40 percent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "greene: so what happens after this? we've got this largely symbolic vote by congress, veto by the president. i mean, does this debate get sort of put to rest at some point?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: not at all. the republicans plan to schedule a veto override vote in the weeks ahead. they do not have the two-thirds majority they need to overturn the president's veto, but that'll be another symbolic gesture by the gop. and this will also help to frame the contrast for the 2016 presidential election. all of the republican candidates running for the white house have promised to undo obamacare. all the democrats have promised to preserve it. so voters will have a chance to weigh in on this debate just as they did in 2012. you remember back then when the supreme court upheld the affordable care act, mitt romney said, if we want to get rid of obamacare, we're going to have to put a republican in the white house. four years later, that's still the case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: so it's going to remain in the political conversation obviously this year. but in terms of substance, process, the chances of this law actually ending - i mean, you've got a lot of americans, polls show, who have very negative feelings about this health care law. but you've got a law that's been in place now for six years. i mean, could it be undone somehow?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "horsley: you know, david, there's been a school of thought for a long time among supporters of obamacare that once the american people get accustomed to these protections they're going to be very hard to undo, that republicans would actually be taking subsidies away from people, denying coverage to millions and that that would just be politically untenable. we're seeing right now something of a test case in kentucky, where the newly elected republican governor campaigned against obamacare, but he has softened his rhetoric somewhat since he's actually taken office. at first he wanted to roll back the state's expansion of medicaid, which was very widespread in kentucky. now he's talking about modifying it instead. however, there's been no such softening of the rhetoric in congress or on the white house campaign trail. so republicans insist they still want to get rid of this law root and branch.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "chideya: i'm great. so first of all what are the characteristics of young invincibles? how young are we talking about and what's keeping them from buying health insurance?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: well, originally young invincibles were males in their 20s. that was how they were always thought of, you know - young guys who felt like they were invincible, so they didn't need health insurance. they would never get sick. they would never have an accident. more recently, the term has come to describe, i think, what most of us think of as millennials, both young men and young women. but the idea is still the same. they feel like they don't need health insurance because they're not going to get sick.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chideya: so why is it a problem for insurers and especially for the affordable care act if these folks don't buy insurance?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: well, the affordable care act made individual insurance available to people who were older and sicker, and they jumped at the chance to buy it. the hope was that younger people would buy it because they were required to and their lower expenses would help balance out the risk pool, helping them basically subsidize older, sicker people on the theory that someday they'll become older, sicker people and young people will subsidize them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chideya: last week, aetna at first said that they would be pulling back on coverage in the affordable care act exchanges, saying they were losing money in large part due to these young invincibles, but then another story emerged. so can you walk us through aetna's move?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: they're pulling out of most of the places where they are - have been selling insurance. and, you know, they said it was due to losses, and i don't think anybody doubts they have been losing money. but what came out shortly after that announcement was a letter from aetna to the justice department saying that if the justice department didn't approve aetna's merger with humana, they would therefore have to start pulling out, which is exactly what they did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so some people saw that as kind of a threat that, you know, if you don't do what we want, then we're not going to participate anymore, but others point out that, you know, aetna has an obligation to its shareholders. and even though it makes lots and lots and lots of money in general, it was, in fact, losing money in the exchange markets. pretty much every insurer is complaining that this has not worked exactly as they had wanted, and it's not just the lack of young people. there are unhealthy young people, and there are healthy older people. but basically they don't have the mix that they had hoped for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chideya: so what can policymakers and/or insurers do to convince the young invincibles to actually buy into the coverage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rovner: well, one problem that a lot of insurers have talked about - it's been too easy to buy insurance outside the open enrollment period, which means that you can wait until you get sick to buy insurance. and that's been a problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this year is the first year that the penalty actually goes up to its full amount for not having insurance. so now depending on how much they earn, young people could be responsible for fines that go up to about $2,500. so that could convince some of them that maybe they would like to spend that money on insurance instead. and then, of course, depending on who's elected president and who's elected to control congress next year, there could be some more changes to try to smooth out some of the bumps that have been seen in the implementation of the law.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "palmieri: i do think that joe biden sounded like he would play well in missoula. you know, the - my big takeaway from the debate was that if you want to beat biden, you're going to have to do it on the ground in iowa. i think people thought there might be a debate where he really performs badly, and, you know, people are looking for a moment where his support starts to collapse. and i think it's kind of evident at this point that's unlikely to happen. and debates are interesting, but we have to keep in mind they're all headed to iowa. and that was my big takeaway was that's where you're going to have to - that's where you're going to have to beat him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inskeep: so biden, who's been the front-runner in polls, held it together. how did look from kentucky, scott?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jennings: yeah. i have a similar sentiment as jen. i think that nobody in this debate, or, frankly, any other debate, had a moment that drains support away from the rest of the crowd. so that means you have to build a real campaign organizationally to turn out the people that are for you. biden's, you know, bebopping along at 30%. i don't think he's going to go up or down. warren and sanders are still fishing off the same pier. they're fragmenting that wing of the party. and nobody is really moving fast. so at this point, i don't know that we learn much from the debates. what i'm more anxious to find out now is, are they actually building campaigns to turn out the voters who support them? nobody's got a dominant lead. so it's all really coming down to campaign tactics. and can you get out what you've got?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jennings: well, the politics here are, for republicans, when you hear the more radical health care plans, what we hear is we're coming to raise your taxes. i mean, if you hear the bernie sanders-elizabeth warren plans and the more radical plans in the field, we just hear about massive tax increases and losing your private insurance. i thought it was noteworthy that the more not-socialist candidates in the field were more critical of the medicare for all plans last night. but what we see across the board is just plans to raise taxes, take away private insurance and really change - radically change health care in a system where, frankly, most people like the plan that they currently have.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "1. impeachment did not help republicans fire up conservatives in rural areas", "augmented": []}
{"original": "republicans have been saying that impeachment would backfire on democrats and enthuse trump's rural base. but that didn't pan out tuesday in kentucky and virginia. democratic voters in urban areas, on the other hand, are clearly fired up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they showed up, especially in kentucky, in higher-than-usual numbers, while voters in rural areas didn't. trump, who only won 46% of the national popular vote in 2016, needs every last one of the people who voted for him then to come out again, especially as he has done almost nothing to try to win over persuadable voters this time around. kentucky and virginia could be warning signs that impeachment, even though the trump campaign has raised lots of money off it, simply isn't the issue republicans hoped it would be with voters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can't let that happen to me! trump said at his kentucky rally monday night, imploring kentucky voters to go to the polls for bevin. he did not want the the narrative to be: trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, it wasn't the greatest defeat in the history of the world. but it is bad news for trump, despite his campaign dismissing the loss as the result of problems with bevin's campaign. so what will the results mean for his mood and state of mind, as congressional investigators keep asking questions in their impeachment inquiry?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. the suburbs remain a warning sign for republicans", "augmented": []}
{"original": "republicans want to dismiss the results in kentucky as bevin being unpopular and acerbic, and that is a point to consider, especially considering that republican candidates swept all of the other statewide races, mostly by double-digit margins. but bevin's unpopularity does not explain the results in virginia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fact is what we've seen in election after election since trump has been in office is democrats outperforming prior performances — and that strength has been rooted in the suburbs. remember, republicans lost the house in 2018 because suburban voters turned on trump and the gop — and republicans haven't fixed that problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kentucky is a state trump won by 30 points. so this should have been a layup for any generic republican candidate. but bevin is no generic republican. he picked fights with all kinds of constituencies in the state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've seen it time and again — take kansas, for example — that when a governor governs ideologically, they wind up in political trouble. and the opposite is true, too. the three most popular governors in the country are republicans in liberal states: charlie baker in massachusetts, larry hogan in maryland and phil scott in vermont. that should be a lesson that the gop pays attention to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. kentucky likely does not mean much for mitch mcconnell's and trump's chances in the state in 2020", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sure, bevin was unpopular, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is unpopular in his home state, too. and, yes, trump was not quite able to drag bevin across the finish line tuesday night.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that does not mean either trump or mcconnell is in trouble in kentucky next year. over the past decade, mcconnell has often been among the least popular senators with his constituents and yet has comfortably won reelection each time. he and bevin have different brands in the state, and a mcconnell protégé won handily for attorney general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's more, having trump on the ballot will help mcconnell. it's important to remember that while turnout was up substantially from the last governor's race in 2015, it was still down about 35% from the presidential election. expect those numbers to shoot back up in 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "6. virginia is now officially a blue state", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my, how times change and can change quickly. the results tuesday night in virginia mean democrats in the state now control the legislature and every statewide elected office — governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "virginia has outpaced the rest of the country, is no longer a swing state and is moving to being reliably democratic. and that shift came in a year when the top trio of elected democrats in the state faced a variety of scandals that hobbled their ability to campaign for down-ballot candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "7. the politics of health care and guns may be moving left", "augmented": []}
{"original": "before bevin came into office, kentucky had one of the best-run affordable care act (aka obamacare) exchanges in the country. it also expanded medicaid under gov. steve beshear, a democrat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bevin took a very different approach. he tried to institute work requirements for medicaid, which would have resulted in tens of thousands of kentuckians losing health insurance. that was hotly divisive, and his loss tuesday proves that once you give people the benefit, it is very difficult to take it away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that has long been the argument democrats have made in favor of the affordable care act even when it was unpopular. and guess what? as predicted, it has grown more popular, and without an alternative, republicans have struggled to figure out what to do about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in virginia, guns were a top issue after a raft of mass shootings nationally and in the state. gun-control groups outspent the national rifle association by about $500,000, and tuesday's virginia results showed that with a concerted effort, lots of money and focused activism, the tide could be turning on gun policy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "david wessel, byline: good morning, noel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: ok. so let's start with the big picture here. over the past 10 years, what is the trend in health care spending?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wessel: america still spends more on health care than other countries without getting better results. and overall, health care spending continues to grow faster than the economy does. but the 2010s are a decade in which national health care spending grew more slowly than it has in the recent past. so health care accounted for 17.3% of gdp in 2010; 17.7% percent of gdp in 2018.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that increase of four-tenths of a percent is, as my colleagues at brookings matt fiedler and christen young point out, smaller than it has been in any previous eight-year period. they say over previous eight-year periods, spending grew five times as fast. and that's interesting because it coincides with a reduction in the number of americans, as you said, who are uninsured. that's gone for about 15% without insurance in 2010, when the aca was signed into law, to about 9% today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: ok. so it's really obvious that the aca reduced the number of people who don't have insurance. we know that. but what role did it play, then, in health care spending?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wessel: i would say it played a small role in that. and here's where it made a big difference. average annual growth in medicare spending per person has slowed significantly since the aca was passed. and that's simply because the aca said we're going to pay doctors and hospitals and other health providers less. but what the aca didn't do is slow the pace of spending increases by the private sector, which has been growing much faster than government spending programs. and that's partly because we've seen a lot of hospital mergers and other consolidations that allow these providers to raise prices. the private sector - private insurers, the employers - have to pay those higher prices. the government, because it sets prices, doesn't pay them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: i want to ask you about something that we hear from people all the time, which is people saying flat-out, i am paying more for health care every year. are they right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wessel: yes, most of them are right. here's why - because the rate of increase is slowing but spending is still rising. and two-thirds of american adults under age 65 get insurance through their employers, or a small number buy it from insurers directly on the affordable care act exchanges. and the cost of employer-provided health insurance has increased.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and on top of that, workers are paying an increasing share of the costs. you hear a lot about higher copays and deductibles. or they have the workers have to pay a higher share of premiums. and then there are the well-publicized increases in the price of some prescription drugs. so a lot of people are paying more for their health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: it's been 10 years since the aca was signed into law. republicans admit trying to undo it ever since. has it become more or less popular over the last 10 years?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wessel: well, some provisions of the aca have always been very popular, like the ban on insurance companies denying coverage due to preexisting conditions. but when pollsters asked a general question - do you have a generally favorable or unfavorable opinion of the health reform law? - the public has been and remains deeply divided. but interestingly, since president trump took office with his attacks on the aca, the fractions of americans who say they have a favorable opinion of the affordable care act has risen from 41% to 52%.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you might not hear much about that this year. the trump administration has dramatically scaled back its outreach and marketing budget for open enrollment — allotting about $10 million for such efforts, compared with the more than $100 million the obama administration spent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "people who bought coverage last fall and don't shop around will be automatically reenrolled in those health plans — which may not be the best for their needs and may be more expensive than other options.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to understand this problem, you have to time travel to pre-aca times, says sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "before the aca, one of the essential business models for health insurance companies was to discourage risky people from buying into their plans and get as [many] healthy people as they could, she explains. that way, they could get the premium revenue and not have to pay out as much in medical claims.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when you applied for a private health plan as an individual — as opposed to getting insurance through your job or a public plan like medicare — insurers would usually require you to fill out a questionnaire and ask for permission to look through your medical records.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if they found a health condition that concerned them, corlette explains, there were three things they could do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first tool they could use was to simply deny you a policy and just say, 'i'm sorry, we can't cover you.'  the second tool was to issue you a policy but to say, 'we won't cover any care related to your preexisting condition — we see that you have asthma, so we won't cover anything related to an upper respiratory condition.' ", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a third tool would be to simply say, 'we will cover you, but we're going to essentially charge you a higher premium because we think you're a riskier person — we normally charge people $100 a month, we're going to charge you $150 a month,'  corlette explains.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to stop insurance companies from doing this, the affordable care act needed to come up with a way to keep enough healthy people in the market to balance out the cost of covering more expensive, sick people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "think about fire insurance, says larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation. if you let people insure their house once it's already on fire, everyone's going to wait until their house is on fire to buy insurance. it's a similar problem in health care: if you tell people with preexisting conditions that they're guaranteed access to insurance, people who are healthy will tend to wait to buy insurance until they get sick.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the insurance market is made up of sick people who need lots of medical care, premiums skyrocket into what's known as a death spiral, he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, the people who crafted the affordable care act came up with incentives to get more healthy people into the insurance pool. the aca had a carrot and stick, says levitt. the carrot was subsidies provided to low- and middle-income people that made insurance a good value, and the stick was the individual mandate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2017, republicans in congress changed the individual mandate's penalty to $0 as part of the tax bill. (the fact that the penalty is zero dollars is the basis for the legal challenge soon to be argued before the supreme court.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even without the threat of a fine for not having insurance, though, the carrot of the subsidies is still in place and has been very effective at keeping premiums stable, levitt says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as trump pointed out during thursday's debate, premiums are down, everything's down. enough healthy people are buying plans in the private market to keep premiums from skyrocketing, although critics still argue that high plan costs price people out of the market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so without the aca, how would trump and his allies prefer to approach the problem?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we don't know where the president is on this, says douglas holtz-eakin, president of the american action forum, a conservative think tank. trump did sign an executive order related to preexisting conditions in september, but all it did, holtz-eakin says, was to say very firmly that the [health] secretary is going to have to figure this out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are other ways to incentivize healthy people to pay for health insurance. for republicans, the leading alternative approach has been continuous coverage provisions, holtz-eakin says. this idea has been part of republican aca replacement bills before — people could be charged a fee and potentially be locked out of the market if they have a break in coverage, thus presumably motivating the young and healthy to stay consistently insured.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "holtz-eakin says the promise of this model is that an insurer has a stake in more than one year of your life — so there are now incentives to cover prevention more than there would be otherwise. critics have argued that could actually disincentivize healthy people who don't have coverage from joining the market and hurt low-income people who already have trouble finding and maintaining health insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another republican idea is to go back to high risk pools, which were common before the aca. this divides the market into healthy people and sick people. that way, healthy people can pay lower premiums, but the pool for sick people gets expensive fast. monthly premiums — even if they're very high — from the limited pool of sick people would not pay for all their care, meaning the government and insurance companies would have to step in to cover costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, on the other side of the political spectrum, there's the idea of medicare for all, where everyone is covered in a government-funded plan. that would ensure people with preexisting conditions can be covered, says levitt, but that's an idea the trump administration would never go for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the affordable care act is fully struck down by the supreme court without a replacement, the preexisting condition protections go away, corlette says, along with the insurance marketplaces, medicaid expansion, premium subsidies and more. as a result, a recent urban institute analysis projected that 21.1 million could lose health coverage, a nearly 70% increase in the number of uninsured.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another concern: covid-19 might be considered a preexisting condition by insurance companies. that could mean millions more people affected by changes to these rules because of the pandemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are a lot of outstanding questions. would the supreme court justices give congress a few months to come up with a fix to the aca or pass a new law to prevent the coverage losses? would the court make a narrow ruling that kept most of the law intact? would it rule against the challengers, keeping the aca as it is?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "without the aca or another federal law requiring insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of their health, they would almost certainly revert back to their business model of yore, says corlette. the incentives for them to start underwriting again and getting rid of high cost, high risk people are too strong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as an example, if you're an insurance company in a city with two competing insurers, and you're the only one that is still taking sick people and enrolling them, you will quickly find yourself with the highest premiums, the fewest enrollees, and and you'll be losing money compared to your competitors, she says.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "morgenstern: well, i just want to make it very clear, first of all, that, you know, the right to bear arms, the freedom of speech, freedom of religion, our fourth amendment rights - these are not partisan issues. these are in the bill of rights. these are important issues, really, for all americans. the president has made clear his policy preferences. that's his job as a policymaker. but in choosing judges, it's very important he doesn't give anyone a litmus test. he would never ask a nominee their particular views on any hypothetical case. that would be inappropriate, and we would never want to put a nominee in that position.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "garcia-navarro: but she has ruled on two abortion-related cases, both times favoring restrictions on access to abortion. barrett also criticized justice john roberts in 2012 on his obamacare ruling. so there is something there that shows how she might rule on issues that are of extreme importance.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "as the gop health bill moves to the u.s. senate, many consumers and lawmakers worry that people who have pre-existing conditions won't be able to find affordable health coverage if the bill becomes law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are a number of strategies under consideration, but one option touted by house republicans borrows an idea that maine used several years ago. it's called an invisible high-risk pool — invisible because people in maine didn't even know when they were in it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the program existed from 2012 until 2014, closing with the advent of the affordable care act's insurance exchanges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the maine pool earned higher marks than most state high risk pools because it had a key ingredient: enough money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem is that in order to do the maine model — which i've heard many house people say that is what they're aiming for — it would take $15 billion in the first year and that is not in the house bill, sen. susan collins, r-maine, told politico. there is actually $3 billion specifically designated for high-risk pools in the first year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "maine's program worked like this: when a resident applied for health insurance, they had to fill out a questionnaire. if they had certain medical conditions known to be costly, their application was flagged for the high-risk pool. to consumers, it was seamless. they paid regular premiums and got the same sort of coverage as any other enrollee in their chosen health plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as mitchell stein, an independent health policy consultant in maine, explains it, the cost of these patients' more expensive health bills was paid by a nonprofit entity set up by the state — the maine guaranteed access re-insurance association, or mgara.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the money to pay for these high-cost patients came from two sources: the insurance policy premiums paid by patients within that high-risk pool, and a $4-a-month surcharge on all policyholders in the state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this invisible high-risk pool was just one part of a larger health reform law in maine, stein says, and that makes a straight-up assessment of how well the strategy worked difficult. but it's a great theory, he says, and can be an appropriate way to handle these things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "eric cioppa, superintendent of maine's bureau of insurance, agrees with stein. in maine, for the period of time it was operating, it worked very well, cioppa says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "though only in effect for a brief period, cioppa says, the invisible high-risk pool did keep costs down in the individual market, where anthem was the largest insurer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "without the invisible high risk pool, cioppa says, anthem would, by its own estimates, have increased rates more than 20 percent. instead, the rates went up less than 2 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but steve butterfield, policy director of the maine-based advocacy group consumers for affordable health care, cautions that there was a crucial aspect of maine's invisible high-risk pool that fueled its success: it was well-funded. the version proposed in the house gop health bill, he says, is not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "an analysis that was done on what this program would need showed that it would need $15 billion to $20 billion per year to have any kind of reasonable impact on premiums, butterfield says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the gop bill does allocate about $15 billion to $20 billion — but that is for almost a full decade, not per year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of our concerns, butterfield says, is if the feds are going to put this in place and only kick in a token amount of money, is it going to be up to the states to pick up the slack — pick up the tab, and pay into this thing to make it work?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "furthermore, butterfield says, as the law stands now, under the affordable care act, there's no need for high-risk pools of any sort. the idea to use invisible high-risk pools is a solution to a problem that the gop health care bill creates. right now people can buy insurance regardless of their health status, whether or not they have a pre-existing condition. it's the gop bill that would allow states to opt out of that obamacare rule.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't understand, butterfield says, why it would be a good idea to, on the one hand, say, 'well, we're worried about pre-existing conditions, so we're going to throw not enough money at a problem we're creating. at the same time, we're going to allow insurance companies to charge sick people more.'

{"original": "in a new biography of roberts, biskupic says his conservative beliefs have had a profound influence on american law but that he's also determined to protect the court's reputation for impartiality. biskupic's book explores the roots of roberts' conservatism and its impact on decisions involving voting rights, affirmative action, campaign finance and abortion. she also examines his vote upholding the affordable care act, which enraged conservatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "joan biskupic was a legal affairs editor for reuters and the supreme court correspondent for the washington post. a pulitzer prize finalist and the author of books on sandra day o'connor, antonin scalia and sonia sotomayor. she's now a legal analyst at cnn. her new book is the chief: the life and turbulent times of chief justice john roberts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, joan biskupic, welcome to fresh air. tell us a little bit about john roberts' background. it was an affluent background, right? his dad was an executive at a steel company. he graduates from this prep school, goes to harvard and works really hard there. he seems to have always been a really serious and focused young man. what did he sacrifice in return for all those efforts?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "joan biskupic: his wife, jane, told me that when he was at cambridge - studying at harvard, which he got through as an undergrad in just three years and then did law school in three years - he only went into boston once or twice, that he was so devoted to his schoolwork. and she told me that he later regretted that he didn't get out and about more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the other thing i want to mention is that his roommate said that he was rarely, you know, without a bottle of pepto-bismol. he tended to be good at fighting his nerves, but he did get a nervous stomach. and one consistent theme that i found throughout is that, as much as he presents himself so well and he seems to be such a fine speaker, he can get really nervous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, those early episodes that people told me about when he was anxious about how he would do in school translated, then, to when he was an oral advocate. and everyone regarded him as so sterling, but colleagues would say his hands would shake almost uncontrollably before he would step up to the lectern to argue a case. so he became quite skilled at putting himself at ease and delivering in a way that really made his name in washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so he goes to harvard law school. he's on the law review, does great things and then ends up with a couple of clerkships out of law school, one of them with supreme court justice william rehnquist. what kind of influence did rehnquist have on roberts?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: at the time that john roberts worked for william rehnquist, rehnquist was an associate justice. and he was at the far-right wing of the court and often alone. in fact, his clerks got him a little doll of the lone ranger because he often dissented alone. but william rehnquist, in those years - in the late '70s and early '80s - was known for sowing seeds of legal reasoning that could then be picked up and turned from dissenting opinions into majority opinions, laying the groundwork for future rulings that would move the court in a more conservative direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so in an opinion which may or may not go your way, you assert that such a certain legal principle has been established and recognized and then, four years later, call upon that assertion in another case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: that's right. that's right. and just to flash forward to john roberts' tenure as chief justice, we've seen him do that in the context of voting rights in a 2009 case to a 2013 case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: the early years of his legal career were in the 1970s in which there were a lot of really contentious issues about, you know, affirmative action and school integration through busing, etc. in 1980, ronald reagan is elected. he was enthusiastic about reagan. and he ends up getting a job at the justice department. what does he do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes. john roberts had almost perfect timing throughout life. you mentioned that he came of age in the 1970s when, you know, there - you know, era of civil rights tension; liberalism is still dominant in america. but just as john roberts is finishing his judicial clerkships, ronald reagan is elected. and conservatism suddenly is in ascendance. and john roberts hears ronald reagan's inaugural speech in january of 1981. and he says - i felt the call; i wanted to be part of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and he goes right from the clerkship with william rehnquist to the reagan justice department. and there he is, for the first time, with so many like-minded attorneys who want to roll back liberal-era policies. and he writes to one of his mentors, judge henry friendly, who he clerked for on the u.s. court of appeals for the 2nd circuit - and he writes to him and he says, this is an exciting time, when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and john roberts really found a home among other reagan lawyers and was more than just an employee in the administration. he took up the call.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: one of the issues that he addressed in the job as deputy attorney general were - was issues of the voting rights act and affirmative action. what kinds of positions did he take?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: john roberts, almost immediately in coming to the justice department in 1981, joined the opposition to a broad interpretation of the voting rights act of 1965. he believed that many of these issues of discrimination should be handled on the local level by the states and that judges shouldn't be as involved and that the federal government shouldn't be involved. and he became a strong lieutenant to then-attorney general william french smith to try to narrow the protections of the voting rights act. and so many of the memos he wrote in those days, in 1981 and 1982, have themes that have translated into his rulings now on the supreme court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: can you think of an example of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes. at a time when - congress was looking at renewal of the voting rights act - some very important provisions. and the reagan administration was far to the right of where congress was at the time, and attorney general william french smith was the public face of this position. and he was laying out the administration's position on renewal of the voting rights act and how it shouldn't go as far as congress wanted it to go. and he was trying to pull it in so, as i say, there wouldn't be as much federal enforcement in what reagan officials felt would be matters better left to the states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and if i can just interject here - i mean, a lot of this involved provisions in the voting rights act, which required changes in voting procedures in certain states with a history of discrimination - to have them reviewed by federal officials before they were enacted, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes. there were two provisions that were on the table in late 1981 and 1982. but the core one that required renewal was what was known as section 5. and that's the part of the voting rights act that covers states and other jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. and those cities, states, municipalities were required to obtain justice department approval before changing any kind of electoral practices. that was to ensure that anything that they put in place - maybe a change in voting times, a new voting location, new voting district maps - that they wouldn't be discriminatory. so there was that screening preclearance process that was very important to enforcement of the voting rights act and protecting african-americans and latinos from discrimination - essentially getting out ahead of it rather than another section of the voting rights act, section 2, which addresses discrimination after a policy is actually in place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so john roberts believes that - at this time, he's, as i say, trying to buck up attorney general william french smith. but he also feels that the reagan administration's position on voting rights act is being mischaracterized in the press. he was watching all the coverage. and he was also furious when anyone broke ranks from the reagan administration position and would often write to his superiors about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: a lot of these writings would certainly be illuminating of robert's views on some key legal issues and might be of issue when he later is appointed to the court or other positions. was he concerned about whether these issues would be publicly available?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: he was, and this is part of john roberts' great skill of looking ahead, always being many steps mentally ahead of either his colleagues or his adversaries. and he seemed to express some trepidation at the - about the possibility that some of his memos might soon be open. the presidential records act of 1978 had been passed after the watergate scandal, and that allowed disclosures of executive branch material 12 years after a president had left office, which, in reagan's case, would end up being about 12 years from 1989.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, again, he, is just, you know, in his late 20s at the time this is all going on, but he is seeing so far into the future that he starts talking - he starts encouraging officials in the reagan administration to try to amend that act. and he writes a memo in 1985 that says, just think, any member of the public will only need go to the reagan library and see any internal white house deliberative document they want to see, unless we change things. and he refers to the, quote, pernicious effect of the statute; that's the presidential records act of 1978.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and he writes - this is - now, again, he's just a young man at this time. he writes, 12 years is a brief lifetime in public life. many of the personalities who are now candidly discussing sensitive white house materials and certainly many of the authors of the memoranda - perhaps he's even thinking of himself, dave - you know, will still be active 12 years from now, and how correct he was. john roberts likely anticipated, without knowing exactly how it would happen, that his once confidential writings could one day be revealed and potentially used against him, as they sort of were in 2005.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right, a man who knows he is going places. so did all this material eventually become public when he was nominated to the supreme court in 2005?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes, in 2005, once he's nominated to, first, succeed sandra day o'connor, but then, of course, to succeed chief justice william rehnquist, who has passed away, all these materials come out. and we see what he is saying about the voting rights act, and we see what he's saying about, you know, reining in the core provisions i referred to earlier that were supposed to, you know, fight the disenfranchisement of african-americans and latinos at the ballot box.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so (laughter) he's faced with these memos, and they all come back to him. and it's especially, you know, democrat ted kennedy of massachusetts, democrat dick durbin of illinois and several others on the left are laying them all out to him and saying, why did you write this? why did you write that?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biskupic: so john roberts gets on the court in 2005, and just a couple years later, a very important case involving school integration efforts comes before the supreme court. this is at a time when public school districts were creating programs to try to maintain integration gains of earlier decades or try to restore them after they've slipped away. and the supreme court gets two cases - one from seattle and one from louisville.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in both, school districts are trying to set up assignment schemes that allow for more integration of districts, and that's to fight national housing trends, where, you know, people start, you know, locking into segregated areas, and, you know, it turns out that black student population is in a particular area, and the white student population is concentrated in another, and for racial and ethnic diversity, school districts try all sorts of placement programs that would merge the two races.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and two of these programs come before the supreme court, from seattle and louisville in 2007, and john roberts takes the lead to strike these down. he thinks that they fly in the face of the guarantee of brown v. board of education, which, of course, had rolled back the separate but equal principle. he doesn't like any kind of government policies that classify people based on race, even if they're trying to remedy segregation, even if they're trying to bring out more diversity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obviously, diversity has been seen as a compelling governmental interest in prior supreme court rulings. but he finds that these measures in seattle and louisville should be struck down, and his position is so far to the right that anthony kennedy breaks off and says, you are undermining the principles of brown v. board of education. but john roberts, in his statement for the supreme court, says that he really sees brown v. board as forbidding not just the kinds of policies that kept blacks in separate schools, but policies that would bring blacks and whites together in integration efforts.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davies: you wrote about how he worked as an assistant in the justice department of ronald reagan and was a strong advocate for conservative views. he also worked in the white house counsel's office for reagan. he did some private practice and then was a - worked - i guess, a deputy solicitor general in the george h.w. bush administration. and he, again, pursued a lot of conservative views, which were then reflected later in his judgments on the supreme court.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biskupic: dave, right from the start, that was one of his main messages - that the judiciary is different from the elected branches. in one of his first speeches, he talked about that. when people would ask, what do you want folks to understand most about the supreme court? he said, the most important thing for people to understand is that we are not part of the political branches. he wanted to separate the court from the executive branch and the congress, in effect, put it above the other two to say, we are not going to respond to constituencies. we're going to rule the way the law dictates. and in one early appearance, he said, you know, basically, if people don't like it, there's not much they can do, short of impeachment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biskupic: that's right. kind of a companion view to his idea that judges are different, that they're above the politics of the day is that they're going to move incrementally. and early on, he talked about trying to build consensus among his colleagues so that they could have not just a lot of 5-4 rulings but as many justices as possible to sign on. and he said the way to do that is to rule narrowly and not move the law much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you might remember during his confirmation hearings he talked about trying to avoid jolts in the law, and he advocated measured steps. now, in some areas of the law, he has done that. in other areas of the law, he has actually not done that. but those are two of his main messages. you can't label us republican or democrat. you can't label as bush judges or trump judges. and we are going to try to have more consensus here than divisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: and yet there is a record, clearly, of the court under roberts kind of pushing policy in the direction - in conservative directions on voting rights and on money and politics. i mean, the citizens united decision had a profound effect on the way campaigns are financed in the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you also point out - and i'd forgotten this - but there was this case that came out of west virginia where a coal company executive had donated $3 million to a committee supporting a state supreme court justice which then cast the deciding vote on a $50 million jury verdict affecting that coal company. it certainly seemed like a case of conflict of interest. roberts said no, it's ok. where do his views about the influence of private money in politics come from?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: he has said that he is the strongest first amendment justice there. he believes that more speech, more money is for the better. let everyone have his or her say, and you have his or her say through money. and that west virginia ruling that you referred to - he was in the minority. anthony kennedy was the one who wrote the opinion saying that that west virginia judge should have recused because of a conflict of interest. and john roberts took the lead for the dissenters. so that was a case that had the intersection of his view that there's no problem with money in politics but also his view that there should be public confidence in judicial integrity. and we shouldn't be second-guessing it, even when the facts are that west virginia matter certainly undercut it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: conservatives found a lot to like in john roberts as chief justice. and then there was the case challenging the affordable care act. and this is a really fascinating chapter of the book. i mean, the justices held three days of oral arguments - right? - which is quite unusual. and it appeared that roberts was going to join the majority in striking down the act. what happened?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: ok. so they go into their private conference - no secretaries, no assistants, no law clerks - just the nine. what we find out first is how they vote. we find out in late june of 2012 that he has joined the liberals in this stunning decision to uphold president barack obama's signature domestic act. and everyone thinks, how did that happen? but no one realizes at the time that actually what went on behind the scenes is that he had switched his vote. in fact, he switched his vote twice. but he had initially voted to strike it down. and behind the scenes, he started to have second thoughts. and he comes up with an alternative rationale based on congress's power to tax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: in other words, because the individual mandate was, you know - the penalties for violating the individual health care mandate were collected by the irs, so you could treat it as a tax. and that was a way for him to uphold it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: that's right. so much of the focus early on, dave, had been on congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. and in that view, john roberts remained insistent that congress had overstepped its power. and as i say, he changed his vote not just on the individual mandate but this other critical provision involving medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the end result was a lot of anger among the conservatives on the court - that they felt betrayed by him - and some puzzlement on the part of the liberal justices about why he would do this. and, you know, i talked to a majority of the justices at the time this happened. and then i talked to a majority of the justices as i was working this out to try to figure out, why did john roberts do this? and i can't give you a single answer, but i think intertwined with all of this is his concern for the legitimacy of the supreme court, perhaps his own legacy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he knew about the problems with the health care system. he had represented insurance companies. he was aware of how long it had taken congress to pass this kind of law. and he moved in this direction, i think, with many factors in mind. and it has certainly affected the public's view of john roberts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: right. so he thought, it's a big economic issue, a big public health issue. congress's will ought to have some weight. and he didn't want the court to look like a partisan hammer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: that's true. we were in an election year in 2012. this looked like a battle between republican appointee john roberts and democratic president barack obama. he didn't want that. he felt that if there was any way that the court could uphold this - and he found a way through congress's taxing power - it should go that route.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it does add another dimension to this man who insists that he's deciding cases only based on the law and only calling balls and strikes as an umpire would. but it was not without cost in terms of distrust among his brethren on the right wing. the positive side is that it has given him a reputation in the public mind of being more moderate. and i know that people still approach him and thank him for doing that because we know how important health care is to americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's a different court now. you know, most - for most of his tenure as chief justice, justice anthony kennedy was there, who was sort of a swing vote between the conservatives and the liberals. he has now been replaced by brett kavanaugh, so it's a more conservative court. and it was interesting to hear president trump say about his controversial, you know, emergency funding for the border wall that he expected, you know, there would be a lawsuit and he would lose in the trial court but sooner or later it would get to the supreme court. and he was essentially saying, you know, like, that's my home court. it's, you know, game, set, match there; they're going to - i'm going to win there. is he right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: no. and in fact, the more he says that, i think it's more - the more donald trump talks about how the court is on his side, the more he's going to drive john roberts to the left because the last thing john roberts wants to do is to appear that he's reinforcing donald trump's notion that judges will automatically rule in the favor of the president who appointed them. we saw john roberts come out with his rebuke of donald trump last november when he said, you know, we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges. what we have are dedicated judges trying to do their best irrespective of who appointed them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "john roberts has new control without anthony kennedy. he had to negotiate with anthony kennedy, had to appease anthony kennedy. he spent a lot of time trying to twist his arm on cases because anthony kennedy held this key vote. but with (laughter) - with his new control comes a new dilemma. how he votes is going to determine how outsiders - the public, the other branches - see this supreme court. so that's a new burden on him. and for a man who from day one wanted to say, we are not political, now in the mix is probably an effort to counter the stereotyping that donald trump has done with the federal judiciary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you have some fascinating stories in the book about justice roberts' disputes with justice sotomayor and particularly her willingness to talk about her roots as a latina growing up in the bronx and how it gave her an understanding of the effects of ethnic and racial discrimination. and you know, one of the things that occurred to me as i read your book is how diversity matters and background matters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, john roberts grew up in a - you know, in an affluent background. and it seems that he excelled because he worked hard, and he was mostly in an atmosphere with other white students. but he did better than they did because of his own hard work and dedication and perseverance. so i think his own experience tells him, i didn't get any breaks; i earned what i have. this business about, you know, discrimination - there's a sense which i wonder if it just doesn't correspond to his experience intuitively whereas justice sotomayor says, yeah, i mean, i feel this. and i'm just wondering - i don't know - if you reflected on that and whether it argues for more diversity in the judiciary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: you know, i think you just nailed something there, dave. i don't know if you recall from the book where i write about a 2013 speech that john roberts has given back at his prep school, la lumiere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: and he talks about the importance of persistence. and he says, the single most important key to success is persistence. you just have to have the drive to press on. it's more important than money, than looks, than talent, than skill. persistence will get you where you want to go. and i thought, first of all, he had all those other things. and he certainly was persistent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but as you draw the contrast with sonia sotomayor, she'd probably say, well, i don't think a lot of people i knew in the bronx could solve all their problems merely based on persistence. so i do think you have two different attitudes about what it takes and what the benefits and disadvantages are as somebody is trying to succeed. their differences generate lots of tension at the court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you know, there's an interesting journalistic question for me here as i read the book. i mean, there's all - an awful lot of public material that you drew on. but you sat down with justice roberts, like, several times - what? - six or seven times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: eight times in the end.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: ok, ok, and a lot of it, i gather, was off the record. you wanted the benefit of his thinking on any basis. but i'm just kind of wondering how you worked that out, how you let it seep into your insights without betraying the terms of a conversation that's off the record.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes. he let me visit him in chambers a total of eight times over many hours. it turned out to be, you know, about 20 hours. and they were tough conversations because he was so incredibly guarded. there were a lot of negotiations over what i could use, what i couldn't use that sort of reinforced my idea of him as certainly very controlling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i wanted to - i went in there with two goals - two overriding goals. one is i wanted to find out more about his life. i mostly wanted to find out about his - you know, his childhood, the influences on his life, his mother and his father, just what he thought of things. but then i also wanted to run by him what i had gotten from the other justices in my conversations with them, and i wanted to let him know some of my conclusions and where i was going so that i could get him to respond. and i wanted to, you know, test his views, you know, on race, which is a big part of this book. i wanted to test his views on, you know, what had happened in the obamacare dispute, which is part of this book.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i was seeking information, but i was also trying to understand him better. so even though the bulk of the conversations were off the record, they still helped me understand him and tried to get into his head as much as i could with someone who was so guarded. but as a journalist, i don't prefer obviously off-the-record or on-background conversations because i can't take the information out into the public sphere and test it. i often think that it's almost a license to get a subject to, you know, sort of steer me in a wrong direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: you're asking for spin (laughter).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biskupic: yes, exactly. so what i would do - you know, i was constantly trying to assess the information i was gathering in these sessions, you know, trying to test out theories with other justices and with the record and with former clerks. so it was - let me just put it this way. when i was with antonin scalia for that biography, i had 12 on-the-record interviews, and everything was very straightforward. he owned everything he said. you know, what you see was what you got.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with chief justice john roberts, he was a much tougher subject start to finish, but i wanted to get in and see him on whatever terms he would let me in. and in the end, dave, he said to me - he ended up cooperating far more than he had anticipated, but there was still so much that i couldn't use. you know, i certainly couldn't use things as quotations, and i couldn't use some information from childhood that i wanted and some of his responses on these cases. but spending time with him one-on-one over so many hours was instructive.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "now we'd like to turn our focus to key republicans whose votes may impact how the trial moves forward. four senators - susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski from alaska, lamar alexander of tennessee and utah's mitt romney - have either stated or hinted a dissatisfaction with the senate leadership's approach to the trial. but given the hyper-partisan, hyper-personal climate in which the trial is taking place, this has gotten us wondering if certain republicans really might be movable on this issue and if so why.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've called on jennifer rubin for this. she is a conservative opinion columnist for the washington post, and she's had her own moments of difference with the republican party and conservative movement in the current era. she's with us now by phone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jennifer rubin, thanks so much for joining us once again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: a few weeks ago, you wrote an open letter to alaska senator lisa murkowski, published in the washington post, in which you urged her to vote for new witnesses. why her? and what was your argument to her?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rubin: well, i could have actually addressed it to really any of the individuals you listed because you're right. there are a few on the fence. but i think because she had indicated publicly that she was amendable to this and because she has an independent streak. she hasn't toed the party line on, for example, justice kavanaugh's confirmation or on the repeal of obamacare.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but essentially, the argument is that ultimately, if you want to vote to acquit the president, and you want to get the benefit, if you will, of an exoneration, you have to present at least the appearance of fairness, at least the appearance of a real trial.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what we've seen over and over again in polls recently - in the washington post poll, 66% of the people want to have a real trial. other polls show even higher numbers - that in order to accomplish that, even if you want to acquit the president, it really behooves you to go through the steps, have witnesses come up. then you can vote however you please at the end of the process. but to cut it off now really doesn't even serve her own interests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: republicans have proposed a witness trade. democrats get witnesses they want, such as former national security adviser john bolton, in exchange for witnesses that some of the republicans say they want, such as the former vice president, joe biden, and his son, hunter. now, i have to say that the democrats have rejected this, and joe biden has said absolutely not. but what do you think of that proposal?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rubin: i think it's a bluff because the republicans in the worst way do not want to hear from john bolton. they don't want to hear from mick mulvaney. they don't want to hear from these people, nor do they want to have documents put forward. so i think jokingly some of the democrats were saying, why don't we just call their bluff?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i don't think they want to get into that sort of game. i think they want to make a clean argument that there are certain witnesses who have relevant evidence - they should come forward - and certain ones who do not. and if they're all that interested, and they think either joe biden or hunter biden has done something wrong, the senate can have hearings till the cows come home to investigate those allegations if they have allegations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think they're trying to take a somewhat principled line, which is they're not going on a fishing expedition. the republicans shouldn't go on a fishing expedition. but if you're going to say the president's been exonerated, you have to have the best witnesses available. and there are some witnesses who could shed some light on this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and before we let you go, as i mentioned, that you have been a conservative columnist for a number of years now, but you've had many disagreements with this president, and you've also been critical of those who have followed him without expressing differences of opinion when you think that they were warranted and when people sort of have indicated that they actually have those differences of opinion. i just want to ask, what is that like? i mean, what is it like to feel you have to set yourself apart at a time like this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, people have made kind of arguments based on what they say their responsibility is to their constituents and their oath and the constitution. but all these people are human. and, you know, it's uncomfortable. and i just wanted to ask what your experience has been when you've taken positions that have been at odds with people who had been your allies on so many issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rubin: well, one thing that adam schiff said on friday night really hit home in a very personal way, which is it's hard to break with people who have been your friends, have been your allies, have been your peers. but at some point, you have to be able to live with yourself. you have to be able to say, what am i doing, and why am i doing it? my purpose as a journalist is to inform and to, i think, persuade that certain values are important. so what's the point of doing it if you're simply going to be, in essence, a hack for the republican party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so although it has been certainly a transformation, i have to say it has made me appreciate more than ever that principle and partisanship often divide, and that we all have to make a choice. in my case, perhaps i've had a luxury. i work for a wonderful journalistic outlet, the washington post, so it hasn't cost me my job. it hasn't cost me my livelihood. but it certainly has severed relationships and brought on quite a fit of hate mail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think that's sort of the price of doing what's right, and there is a satisfaction. there is a joy. there is a sense of even reward in making the right enemies and doing what you think is right. so it's been a stressful time for many of us, but in many ways, the most rewarding part of my career.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "finney: it was distressing to watch and chaotic to watch. i mean, look; you know, if you were watching to try to understand something regarding policy, you didn't get that answer. but you got - what you saw was a president who - he just felt - it felt out of control. and the back-and-forth particularly with the moderator, it felt very childish, particularly when you had, you know, chris wallace saying, you know, mr. president, mr. president, you're going to really like this next question as a way to kind of calm him down. that just was - the lack of decorum and respect and dignity really was beneath the office of the presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: scott, did you think president trump came off looking strong after that or not?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jennings: no, i didn't. and, you know, we talked yesterday and predicted that he would be aggressive with biden in an attempt to get him to crack under the pressure and maybe make some misstatements. the trouble is he went from being on offense to being offensive, and he never let the strategy breathe. he never gave joe biden that chance to be rattled because donald trump never stopped talking for the entirety of the debate. so, no, i didn't think he looked particularly strong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i look at this through the lens of audiences. you know, who does donald trump have to recapture from the 2016 coalition to win in 2020? and i think about women, who are crushing him in the polling right now. and i think about senior citizens who don't seem to be as hot on him this time around. and i'm not sure either of those audiences picked up in a positive way on anything the president did last night.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "martin: so, scott, he said stand back, stand by. that's not a condemnation. in fact, the far-right group then pledged allegiance to the president after those comments. why is he incapable of condemning racist groups?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jennings: yeah, really, really bad moment. there's only one answer to that question, and that is i condemn them. i condemn anyone in our cities who's causing violence, and nobody comes in my name and causes violence and should expect me to support that. there's only one answer. you're the commander in chief. and if you want to look strong on public safety and law and order, as he calls it, you have to condemn all of these groups no matter what form they come in. he failed it. he missed that question last night, and it's going to be the most talked about issue coming out of the debate because he whiffed it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: what do you make - oh, go ahead, karen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finney: well, if i may, i mean, as a black woman, i mean, i was sickened and terrified, just terrified. it literally made me think his - particularly given the tone of the way he was saying it made me think of those old stories from the '60s about dealing with the bull connors of the world. i mean, the - he was so incapable of just saying the word, and there's no reason not to be able to say, i denounce white supremacy or white supremacist violence, for heaven's sake. and it was - you know, it was such a sickening feeling and such a alienating feeling as if i am on my own in this country if my own president doesn't understand why it's important to say that. and the fact that he then went on in part of that exchange to talk about - to say that teaching, you know, racial tolerance or sensitivity is teaching people to hate the country - that means - you know, that we're teaching people the history of, you know, the people in my family who built this country as slaves, teaching the truth about that, that somehow that's inappropriate and then that's something disgusting and despicable is the way he described it. it was beyond the pale and beneath the dignity of the presidency.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jennings: well, he continues to conflate various issues. i mean, look; there have been some reported issues with the mail ballots in some places. pennsylvania is a good example where some folks are actually having trouble figuring out how to turn them in. and so these are real issues, and so that's one set of things.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "lobianco: i used to think that there was a small circle of - an inner circle for mike pence that consisted of three people - mike pence, his longtime chief of staff bill smith and karen pence. and that was my conception for years. and in reporting this book, i found out that it's even smaller than that. it is only karen pence and mike pence in this inner circle. they're the ones who make decisions together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, when the trump campaign was vetting pence, they had no problems picking him out. they had no problems getting information on him, felt like they had a great sense of who he was. they couldn't find anything bad about him, really. they could not find information about karen. and i've - to be honest with you, as a reporter, i understand why because it took me a long time to find out how she moves the needle.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it helps them to have that caricature out there because it keeps that politicized evangelical base with them, and it keeps them from going someplace else, like a nikki haley or some other political opponent. so these caricatures are actually politically beneficial to them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so 2016 rolls around. mike pence can run for reelection as governor. he would love to enter the presidential race, but it's a strong presidential field - decides he'll go ahead and seek reelection as governor. and then this prospect of joining the ticket with donald trump arises. why did the trump camp look to mike pence?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lobianco: so they're having trouble getting moderate republicans - or any republicans, really - to join the ticket. by the beginning of july, it's down to chris christie, newt gingrich and mike pence. paul manafort, who is running the campaign in this moment, and reince priebus, who has taken on more of a role - certainly as it became clear that trump would become the nominee - are both arguing extensively for pence for two different reasons. they see - manafort sees a delegate uprising led by the - by cruz and his supporters. ironically enough, ken cuccinelli, now the acting human - acting dhs secretary in the administration and some others are trying to block the nomination of trump or, you know, deny the nomination on the floor in a delegate battle in the republican national convention in cleveland. priebus sees a different reason for wanting him. he sees that pence can bring back your evangelical voters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and let me point this out because this is really important. trump already has the support of televangelists - jerry falwell, jr., for instance - people who have already gotten on board with trump. so if the televangelists already support trump, why do you need the evangelical voters? because those televangelists don't represent all of your politicized evangelical vote. it's not a monolith. they know - priebus knows that pence, in his different style of evangelicalism - his more quiet, midwestern style - can bring back these quiet, midwestern voters and help boost the margins in the rust belt, in places like wisconsin and western michigan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they want him for different reasons. the problem they face is trying to convince trump to sign up with this guy. trump sees a loser. that's how he views him. and he doesn't like - he thinks that he's weird with the religion. trump's just - he just doesn't like pence at all, so it's kind of vexing for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so there's an interesting moment here when it's coming down to the end and donald trump has just a few choices - former house speaker newt gingrich, chris christie, the governor of new jersey who very much wants to be on the ticket and then pence. and a weird thing happens. the trump campaign wants to make - is going to make a short stop in indianapolis, but the plane has a flat tire. why does this end up mattering?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lobianco: that flat tire - it ultimately changes history. it's july 12, 2016. they land. it pops a flat under the right fuselage of the trump campaign plane. it strands trump in indianapolis. in this moment, one week before the nominating convention, newt gingrich has the upper hand, based on my reporting. jared kushner and ivanka trump are with gingrich in new york in trump tower. they like gingrich. they like the way that he meshes with their father. they like that he's a big ideas person. christie has a good line directly in with trump, but kushner doesn't like christie because christie helped put his father in jail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so there's - pence's in the mix, but he is not the top candidate in this moment. what that flat tire does - it basically relocates the entire campaign to - for about 48 hours to indianapolis. and it forces trump to seriously consider and spend time with mike pence in a way that he hadn't before.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they stay overnight in indianapolis. they get up the next morning. their families have breakfast at the governor's mansion, and what's important here is that jared and ivanka have not met mike pence. this is their first time meeting them. and they go downstairs after breakfast in the governor's mansion for a meeting in the bunker, and it's this family room that's in the basement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and donald trump is sitting across from mike pence - and this is the brass tacks moment - and trump looks at him, and he says, mike, i need killers. he says, why do you want this? i need killers. are you going to be a killer? he holds up his phone, and there's the missed phone calls from chris christie. he's like, look. chris christie, he's a killer. and pence looks at him, and he says, i am not a killer. i can't be that. look. i can help you govern. i can help you lobby congress. i will help you with conservative voters, evangelical voters in the rust belt. but i'm not a killer, and if you want a killer, you should find somebody else, and i will support you and whoever else that is in your effort to change america, but i don't need this.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "lobianco: well, when i first heard this, i thought to myself, wow. she is really angry at trump and having to be stuck with trump. but then i realized something. the more i understood about her influence in their trajectory, their political - their joint political career, it wasn't that she was angry at trump. she was angry at pence. what happened when he signed on - when they both decided to sign on - with trump was they took a gamble, and they never take gambles in their political career. they take a gamble that it's only going to be four months at trump's side, and that...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davies: so i think you say that in the early months of the administration, he tried to be in every meeting he could in the west wing and got into a lot of them but never said anything. talk about his role in the administration, and in particular, the perception that he would actually mimic the president's moves just physically.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lobianco: (laughter) he kind of takes on other people's dynamics. he takes on other people's properties. one source told me that he's like a zelig character. he takes on their mannerisms. you know, you see he does the wink and the nod like reagan used to do. he does really good george w. bush impersonations. he does trump impersonations every now and then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so to your question, i think this is a central question that people have about pence. you know, look. i've seen two tropes out there about him. one is he is a, quote, unquote, shadow president. let me just say he doesn't secretly run things inside there. if there's anyone who's a shadow anything, it would be karen pence, who is a shadow vice president, and i think as we're putting this out now, is not really shadow anymore.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but then the other version - and you see a little bit more of this reported out in the bob woodward book where gary cohn and rob porter have a big say in things - is mike pence is sort of a glorified coat rack. and this is to your question - right? - the guy who shows up, nods, you know, solemnly furrows his brow a little bit and, you know, smiles and, you know, pats everyone on the back but don't really do anything. i think that kind of misses it, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what pence is - he falls in between those two. those are your extreme caricature goalposts for him, and what you really have is a guy who - he works hard on anti-abortion, social conservative policy, you know, the updates of the gay marriage fight, which beat this religious freedom fight that continues. and you also have him in a - with a deep hand in the health and human services and trying to repeal or curb obamacare within that department. but he stays within his lane. he's not forceful. he's not somebody who pushes the president because, remember, ultimately, this is about survival. he has to survive until 2024, so he's not going to do anything that endangers his political viability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "davies: so we're - you know, he and trump clearly are not close, and there have been reports that ivanka trump and jared kushner would like to bump mike pence from the ticket for 2020. what's your sense of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lobianco: let me start by saying that jared and ivanka's people deny this, but what i heard is that they talk about trying to find a woman to run with trump to help them win back the suburbs. this is the major political calculation for them. you know, look. they've also kind of pushed aside pence's operatives within the trump reelection, keeping them out of decisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's a great anecdote i write about where they go out in the field - the trump campaign goes out in the field with some polling, and they try to hide it from pence's team, in part, because the poll comes back and it shows that pence's favorable numbers are much better than trump's favorable numbers. and pence's aide has to go out and actually use a mole within his own campaign to get a copy of one of these polls. it was 14 battleground state polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's - they see that trump or that pence is not helping them. and the other part of this calculation is that they feel like trump has a solid lock on the evangelical vote writ large, so they don't need pence anymore, and they can dump him from 2020. that's - i think that misreads it. and this is what pence's people say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "certainly, his allies say that no, the evangelical vote is not a monolith. it's not just the televangelists who are 100% onboard with trump. it's these other voters that - which is the reason they needed him to begin with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's why i'm confident that this is a real thing. and it's not so much the chatter or the rumors and whatnot, it has more to do with the actions of pence. and you saw this really - this tough july that he had - july 2019 where he goes - he gets yanked back from this weird trip to new hampshire that's unexplained. then he gets a - a few weeks later, he gets sent down to a detention camp and - one of the border detention camps. and it's just, you know, just terrible scene, you know - men and women, cages. it is just a horrible scene.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davies: you know, we've just - the house democrats have just embarked upon a formal impeachment inquiry. and obviously, we don't know where this will go and will take some time to play itself out. but i feel i should ask you since we have you here that if it comes to it, if donald trump leaves the presidency, what would a mike pence presidency look like?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lobianco: great question. i think that it would look very - like a very conservative george w. bush presidency. expect a return to sort of pre-trump policies for the most part - neocon policies, neo conservative policies, certainly in foreign policy, fiscal policy. expect more - i would expect more fiscal restraint than you've seen under trump. i don't know that you'd see a return to free trade.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but i don't know that he would be a fiery theocrat the way that a lot of folks on the left present him as. because i think that, ultimately - and this is something that his people told me - so let's say he does get impeached, and they remove him. he wants to win the presidency in his own right. and he wants it to be a victory that sort of cements him in u.s. history. i think he'd revert back to that - the ambition, the shapeshifter. it's not a guarantee that he would be an ideologue. it's all about winning. it's all about being a political opportunist.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in fact, canceling the law in full — as judge reed o'connor in fort worth, texas, ordered in his 55-page decision — could thrust the entire health care system into chaos.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to erase a law that is so interwoven into the health care system blows up every part of it, says sara rosenbaum, a health law professor at the george washington university school of public health. in law they have names for these — they are called superstatutes, she says. and [the aca] is a superstatute. it has changed everything about how we get health care.

{"original": "o'connor's decision is a long way from implementation. he still must rule on several other aspects of the suit brought by 18 republican attorneys general and two gop governors. and a group of state democratic attorneys general has promised to appeal o'connor's decision, which would send it to the 5th circuit court of appeals and, possibly, the u.s. supreme court. the high court has rejected two previous efforts, in 2012 and 2015, to find the law unconstitutional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, here are five ways that eliminating the aca could upend health care for many, if not most, americans:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more than 20 million americans who previously were uninsured gained coverage from 2010 to 2017. some of that was due to an improving economy, but many also gained the ability to buy their own coverage, thanks to the law's federal subsidies to defray the cost of insurance. other provisions of the affordable care act played a significant role, including its ban on restrictions for people with pre-existing medical conditions, expansion of the medicaid program to more low-income adults and allowing adult children to stay on their parents' health plans until reaching age 26.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the law were reversed, federal funding for medicaid and individual insurance subsidies would stop, and insurers could once again refuse coverage to or charge more for people who have health problems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "fundamental changes to the health care system could be stymied", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the impact of eliminating the aca could be felt well beyond those people who are the direct beneficiaries of the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gail wilensky, who ran the medicare and medicaid programs under president george h.w. bush, says such a change would be very disruptive because so much [of the aca] has affected the way health care is organized and delivered, and the way insurance is provided.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, says rosenbaum, the increase in health coverage meant that suddenly it became possible for health care systems to care for, by and large, an insured population.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "previously many hospitals, doctors and other health providers spent considerable time and effort figuring out how to treat — without going broke —people who lack insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "after the aca kicked in, these providers began to worry less about whether they would get paid. and the federal government started pushing them to create new initiatives aimed at improving the quality of care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those include, for example, measures that base some federal payments on patients' health outcomes rather than on each individual procedure performed. under the aca, the government also encouraged strategies that improve health across the u.s. — like improving the availability of healthful food, bicycle paths and preventive care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if millions of people lost insurance, rosenbaum says, those health providers would have to go back to wondering how they will be able to pay their bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "medicare and medicaid would be dramatically altered", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the popular medicare program, which covers an estimated 60 million seniors and people with disabilities, was a major focus of the aca.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elimination of the federal health law would take away some popular benefits the aca conferred — everything from free preventive care to the closing of the doughnut hole in medicare's prescription drug coverage. the doughnut hole refers to a coverage gap that had previously exposed large numbers of beneficiaries to thousands of dollars in drug costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the law also changed the way medicare paid for hospital, home health and outpatient care. many current payment policies are based on authority provided by the aca, and if it went away, medicare would have to rewrite those payment regulations. millions of beneficiaries belong to accountable care organizations that were created under the health law, and it is unclear how their care would be affected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the biggest change in the medicaid program would be the elimination of the expansion of coverage. loss of the aca would also roll back a 23-percentage-point boost in medicaid prescription drug rebates, which has saved states billions of dollars, according to cindy mann. she ran medicaid under president barack obama and is now a partner at the health consulting firm manatt health.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aca required states to calculate medicaid eligibility differently — changing what counts as income — so all the work states did to alter their information systems would have to be recalculated, she says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wide array of health programs at risk", "augmented": []}
{"original": "shorthand descriptions of the health law often stop at its provisions providing consumer protections and expanding medicaid. but the aca included sweeping changes to other parts of the health system that rarely get mentioned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, it created the first pathway for food and drug administration approval of generic copies of expensive biologic drugs, by incorporating the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009. biologic drugs are more difficult to reproduce than other types of medications.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "also hitching a ride on the aca was a long-delayed bill providing permanent spending authority for programs provided by the indian health service, which serves native americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "all those programs would be thrust into doubt by invalidating the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "loss of the aca also would impact a popular program that predates obamacare: the health insurance portability and accountability act, or hipaa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aca's protections for pre-existing conditions — banning insurers from charging people with health problems higher premiums or refusing to sell to them altogether — built on similar protections for people with employer insurance. congress included those protections in hipaa, which was enacted in 1996. and far more people are touched by hipaa than by the aca, because far more people get health insurance through their employer than through the individual market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, when congress wrote the aca, it incorporated hipaa safeguards into the pre-existing-condition provision. that means if the aca is struck down, the hipaa protections might disappear as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even the trump administration's health agenda could be compromised", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president trump has railed against the health law, but his department of health and human services has a priority list that relies in some significant ways on the continued existence of the aca.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "strange is hoping that trump's appearance on his behalf — and a subsequent visit by vice president pence on monday — can be the boost he needs to get over the finish line in the primary. at a debate with moore on thursday, strange couldn't mention enough that he was trump's chosen candidate. and in a state that went heavily for trump in the primary and general and gave him some of his biggest rally crowds, he's hoping that support for trump will translate into support for his candidacy with voters.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "davis: when he talks about blowing the opportunity, the concern i hear the most from republicans on capitol hill is that if health care collapses - if they cannot deliver on what has been their signature campaign promise, the infighting and the bad blood that it will generate will make it almost impossible for republicans to move forward on their other legislative priorities. that includes overhauling the tax code and that long-promised infrastructure bill that the president and republicans and some democrats in congress say that they want the most.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "greene: and let's bring in npr's david schaper in chicago, who's been following this story. hi there, david.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: so what's the reasoning behind boeing's decision here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schaper: well, boeing was facing a couple of hard realities. first is that the federal aviation administration, an agency once accused of being too cozy with boeing, is now sternly warning boeing's ceo to stop with the unrealistic expectations for when this plane could be allowed back into service. the agency safety experts will be taking all the time that they need to get their evaluation and analysis done right. and the faa's head says he won't be rushed into making a decision. and i'm hearing that that means that the plane will likely remain grounded until at least february or march.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second hard reality is that boeing has been burning through cash at a rate of, according to some estimates, about $2 billion a month. the company did slow production a bit back in april, reducing the number of planes produced from 52 a month to 42. but it now has about 400 finished jets just sitting in storage. and it cannot deliver them to customers to get final payment. richard aboulafia is an aerospace industry analyst for the teal group.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "richard aboulafia: it's been really painful for boeing. they've been maintaining production and not bringing in any revenue. this is very painful from a balance sheet perspective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: ok. painful for the company. what about the people who work for the company? i mean, the 737 max is built at a plant outside seattle. there are, like, 12,000 employees working there..", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: are they going to be laid off, furloughed? what's going to happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schaper: well, boeing says no at this point. so the company says it doesn't expect any layoffs for workers at this time anyway. the statement announcing the decision to suspend production says the company plans to have the affected workers continue 737-related work or be temporarily assigned to other plants in the area.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there's still a fair amount of anxiety in and around the plant. we had ashley gross of our member station knkx ask around about the impact. and she talked to veronica medina, who, with her family, owns a mexican restaurant called torero's at a strip mall called the landing across the street from the huge 737 plant in renton.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "veronica medina: well, obviously being right here at the landing, it's very significant. we get a lot of lunch crowds. we get, you know - renton in general very dependent on boeing's well-being.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schaper: medina says that even if boeing employees aren't laid off, if they aren't going in and out of that factory across the street, her business may suffer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: but, david, i mean, the reality here is there can be a ripple effect in the economy from a decision like this. i mean, there's a whole supply chain that feeds the production of the boeing 737 max, right? i mean, could this have a big economic impact overall?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schaper: yeah. this is where the shutdown could be felt more deeply. and it won't be so much in seattle but in places like wichita, kan., where boeing supplier spirit aerosystems makes the fuselage and other parts for the 737 max and in evendale, ohio, where cfm international makes the engines for the planes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are hundreds of companies that supply parts to the 737. and boeing may do something to help soften the blow for them a little bit. but those companies still may be forced to lay off workers. here again is richard aboulafia of the teal group.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "aboulafia: it depends how long it lasts. if we're talking about just a few weeks or a month or two, it's not going to be the end of the world. if this is a three-month stoppage or conceivably even longer, yeah, the broader economy would very definitely feel some pain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: so a lot of question about timing here. and you said this could, go, like february, march? or does anyone really know?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "greene: so it looks like oxycontin made the sacklers very, very rich. remind us just the context here. why is that so controversial?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mann: well, it happened at a time when a lot of americans were dying as the prescription opioid epidemic was going viral across the united states, ravaging communities. the company, of course, faces thousands of civil lawsuits tied to its alleged role spurring this addiction crisis, legal blowback so big it forced the company into this bankruptcy. but as you said, the sacklers had already pocketed billions of dollars. and in the end, a lot of that money may not ever be forfeited as part of any settlement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: and what's new here is some details that we're learning from a new audit of the company. so what exactly is this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mann: yeah. the data submitted to the bankruptcy court on monday shows that, in all, members of the family withdrew roughly $12.2 billion from their company. and a review by the new york times found that this really accelerated. the sacklers began pulling more and more cash out of the company beginning in 2008 - hundreds of millions of dollars every year. some of that went to pay taxes, but it also went into their personal trusts. and this is drawing particular scrutiny, david - some of it went into offshore accounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: ok. so they have all of this money, it seems. the family has offered to pay something like $3 billion of this personal wealth to settle opioid claims against purdue pharma. but state attorneys general are saying that's simply not enough. is that right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mann: yeah. that is right. the sacklers have consistently denied any wrongdoing. but they have offered this bankruptcy deal that would mean them paying out billions of dollars of their cash and giving up control of purdue pharma. as part of that, they've asked the bankruptcy court to essentially halt all personal lawsuits against them. they would be out of the opioid business but still one of the richest families in the country because of oxycontin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the coalition of states are pushing back. they're saying that the sacklers should first give a full accounting of all their personal holdings, even stuff that's offshore in foreign accounts. and those attorneys general want to claw back more of that cash. and this audit is adding fuel to that argument. new york's attorney general letitia james issued a statement last night demanding more detailed financial records. she said she wants full transparency into their total assets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "greene: ok. and on its face, this doesn't look very good, either. you have this other part of the bankruptcy process - purdue pharma's decision to pay out these big bonuses to executives in the company. i mean, what is the court saying about that? are they going to allow that to happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mann: they are. judge robert drain agreed earlier this month to let the company pay roughly $35 million in bonuses this year to employees. the argument from purdue pharma that the court accepted is that key staff, you know, people in the company, needed to keep the firm operating during this turbulent time. those folks just won't stay on if they're not well-compensated. but, of course, david, that money that's being paid out is money that will never be paid to victims or to communities.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the trump administration plans to suspend billions of dollars in payments that had been expected by health insurers under the affordable care act or obamacare. the administration said saturday that this is necessary to comply with a judge's order that found the formula for distributing the payments was flawed. now, these are so-called risk adjustment payments paid by insurers to other insurers to help fund sicker patients who cost more to insure. health insurers say, without the money, the health insurance market will be disrupted, premiums could rise and fewer plans could be available.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're joined now by dr. martin hickey. he's founder of the cooperative health plan new mexico health connections, which sued the government over the payments. we reached him in albuquerque.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dr. hickey, thanks so much for speaking with us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin hickey: happy to do so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: your organization sued because you view the way the money was distributed as unfair. can you try to help us understand this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hickey: yes. essentially, what it comes down to is that the formula that the center for medicare and medicaid services chose to implement favors large and established plans. under the aca, cms was directed to administer the exchange and also to institute the co-ops to develop more competition. and, since its inception, these large, established plans have been the vast receiver of these monies, and small plans and new plans have had to pay out lots of money and, in fact, has been a major factor in forcing 19 co-ops to go out of business since they were developed by the aca back in 2014.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we think this is actually very good for consumers because it will allow more new entrants to come into the marketplace. and, as we know, the more competition, the lower the prices, so we view this as a very beneficial ruling for consumers throughout the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: i'm glad you raised that because i understand that your intention in bringing this suit was to see the formula adjusted in a way that you considered to be more fair. but were you concerned or are you now concerned that the administration won't restore this money at all and that no health plans will be funded under the program? now, some advocates or activists are saying that this is a way to sabotage the affordable care act. i mean, the administration and many republicans in congress have made no secret of their desire to scrap it and start over. so are you concerned that there might be no money being distributed at all?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hickey: what i would like to see is for this to play out in the courts if necessary. i would be concerned if cms did not address and change the formula so that it was fair to all health plans that participate in the exchange.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: that was dr. martin hickey. he's founder of the cooperative health plan new mexico health connections. we reached him in albuquerque. dr. hickey, thanks so much for joining us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: now, we wanted to get a sense of what this would mean for the health insurance marketplace more broadly, so we've called anna wilde mathews, a reporter at the wall street journal who broke the story. she's with us now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "anna, thanks so much for joining us as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so tell us a little bit more about the program - how it has worked to this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mathews: the program involves moving money around among insurers. the idea is that insurers that enroll a lot of healthy people who are not going to be very costly pay into the program. and those that enroll a lot of people who have a lot of health conditions and maybe have higher claims costs are supposed to receive money out of the program. the point is to make sure that there's no incentive for insurers to seek out only healthy people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: how much do the major health plans rely on these funds?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mathews: well, it's a zero-sum game, so some pay into it and some receive money out of it. for 2016, for instance, the money involved in the program represented approximately 11 percent of the premiums in the individual market. so that's a large percentage of the market and a meaningful sum. for the 2017 plan year, which are the payments that would've been going out this fall, the total was going to be about $10.4 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so what will the suspension of this program mean for insurers and for members and what they pay for premiums? do we have any sense of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mathews: the insurers that are currently in the marketplace are complaining that the announcement creates a great deal of uncertainty for them right now. it's very vague about exactly how long the suspension could be or what could trigger the end to it. it's vague about how it will play out in the future. so that creates a lot of uncertainty at a time when insurers are currently making decisions about rates and offerings for the affordable care act plans for 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and i note in your story that the administrator of the program, seema verma, said in a statement that the administration is disappointed by the court's recent ruling. but it's also true that this is an administration that has not been supportive of the affordable care act. do you think that the administration is, in fact, going to try to adjust the formula and release these funds at some point?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mathews: it's not clear that they have legal authority to simply end the program. the judge in the new mexico case disagreed with a factor of the formula that was used to implement the program, but i don't believe that his ruling implied that the entire program was unacceptable or the concept behind the program was unacceptable. and the program is part of the law. it's hard to tell how this will play out. the insurers too are not clear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the cdc, the centers for disease control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. but one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like seattle. by the time that the trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. and now as we talk in march, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: and it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: the trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. and there is some truth to that. now tests have been churned out. but the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. and even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: why didn't the u.s. use the world health organization's test?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "diamond: ...to have someone tip me off because that is a question that i've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. the world health organization did have a working test. someone somewhere made the decision that the u.s. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: it's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the united states is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: i think at this point, terry, south korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the united states has done in the past two months. south korea can do 10,000 tests per day. at last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what do you think the impact is of the lost time?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: i think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and i think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. we are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the united states. if there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. and if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. so what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. but in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the u.s. just a step behind at every step of the way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. he didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. it would look bad; it would make him look bad. so what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: are there cuts the trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? for example, wasn't there a national security council health task force that was disbanded under trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. after a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with dan diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. he's been writing about how president trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so how america responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most americans don't know much about. so let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. let's start with alex azar, who's the head of health and human services. he took over after tom price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: the tom price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. and, yes, politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. and i say our because i was teamed up with my wonderful colleague rachana pradhan. alex azar has been like the forrest gump of republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, azar would pop up in so many notable moments. he clerked for conservative justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. he worked on the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton. and then he was a lawyer working on the florida recount in 2000, bush v. gore. because bush won, alex azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the bush administration, ending up as the no. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at eli lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: what is it about his management style that's so alienating?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. but his critics would say that alex azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: my impression is that he is anti-abortion. he has described hhs as the department of life. he described the trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. he said that in a very admiring way. how has that affected him as the leader of hhs? and was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so you've reported that both alex azar, the head of health and human services, and seema verma, the head of medicare and medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please trump. they are also - verma and azar - kind of at war with each other.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: oh, not kind of; they're absolutely fighting it out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: ok. thank you for the (laughter) clarification. so how does their desire to please trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? and that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, alex azar has been the point person on president trump's goal of lowering drug prices. azar has pitched himself as the fixer. he worked in the drug industry at eli lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. but so far, a lot of the plans that the trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. so alex azar also hasn't been able to deliver. and that means both of them are conscious, azar and verma, of the need to show trump that they are delivering. and they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond. he's a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back after a break. this is fresh air.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so you've reported that alex azar of health and human services and seema verma of medicare and medicaid both want to please president trump. how have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? and is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? in other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in trump's good graces?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: i think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. in the case of alex azar, he did go to the president in january. he did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. there were aides around trump - kellyanne conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, seema verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. but i've talked to officials who say that seema verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: well, let's take a look at robert redfield, who's the head of the centers for disease control. and he was a well-known aids researcher, and you say he was a favorite of christian conservatives when trump appointed him in 2018. he helped fight hiv-aids in africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. can you tell us more about that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: so is there a decision, for better or worse, that redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the u.s. for better or worse?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: it's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. but i do think, terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from cdc that's been troubling. the failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a cdc problem. the failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that cdc director redfield admitted this week. and at some level, that goes to the leader. these are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the cdc to protect us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it seems like mike pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. let's look at pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of indiana. so tell us a few key things about pence in indiana.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. and when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "diamond: hhs, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask congress to supply to fight coronavirus. this was about two weeks ago. and the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. and it also reveals what the priorities are. after i started reporting the story, i was told that seema verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the white house, trying to get the white house to intervene on giving her her email back. i'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. and that's one of several examples i could give you from the past few weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "diamond: about two weeks ago, my colleague nancy cook and i reported that the white house had soured on alex azar leading the coronavirus response. he was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on capitol hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in politico. but by the end of the day, mike pence had replaced him. and by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, debbie birx, to help run the response, too. that's what people saw in public.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "3. investigations: leadership can direct committees to investigate top trump administration officials or policies.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "5. the impeachment process: the constitution gives the house of representatives the power to impeach a civil officer of the government. any articles of impeachment would be referred to the house judiciary committee for review and possible hearings. if the committee approves any articles, the full house would vote on impeachment and then refer the matter to the senate for a trial. top congressional democrats are throwing cold water on moving to impeachment quickly, but they say if there is evidence that emerges from the special counsel's probe of any wrongdoing, they don't rule out judiciary committee action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "6. potential government shutdown: if democrats retake control of the house, the president will be forced to negotiate on government spending to enact key administration priorities. standoffs over border-wall money, cutting money for agencies regulating industries and implementing health care programs are likely and could trigger government shutdowns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the democrats win one chamber or both, klain says, then congress returns to being a check and balance on the president. that means one thing for certain — a lot of oversight.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "meanwhile, republicans are not united in their views of the maintenance-of-effort requirement. some favor it because, they say, it shifts more authority of the program to states. others say it would very likely lead some states to move many chip enrollees into either medicaid or private insurance policies sold on the obamacare exchanges — both areas where the federal government may pay an even higher share of the costs, pope says.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "repealing the affordable care act was at the top of republicans' policy wish list ever since the law was passed in 2010. seven years later, having gained the white house and majorities in both houses of congress, the gop apparently has failed to repeal that law, also known as obamacare.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here are a few possible changes:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the biggest threats to the affordable care act has been a lawsuit filed by house republicans that could have ended what are called cost-sharing subsidies, which help people limit their out-of-pocket expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as kaiser health news' julie rovner reported last year, the suit, filed in 2014, charged that the obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "last spring, a judge sided with house republicans, but allowed the subsidies to remain in force pending appeal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with trump's election, his administration took responsibility for the appeal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "should the trump administration decide to drop that appeal, it would be quick, easy and potentially crippling to obamacare. trump reportedly wants to stop making the payments, politico recently reported.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that might sound like a simple decision for a president who detests the affordable care act, but it could come with heavy political consequences.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if they stop defending the litigation, then they have to stop reimbursing insurers for the [subsidies] and the markets would crater, says sabrina corlette,a research professor at georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms. it seems politically risky to think voters wouldn't blame them for that. the congress could step in and appropriate the money, but it's hard to see that getting buy-in from the far right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perhaps with those political realities in mind, some in the gop have said they are willing to spend that money anyway. in march, some top house republicans said they wanted to keep the subsidies going.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. remove the individual mandate's teeth", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration can't do away with the mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance on its own, but it can greatly weaken it. doing so would be another way to seriously undermine the affordable care act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one way is through the irs. that individual mandate is about tax incentives — fail to get insurance, and you have to pay a penalty. so to hobble obamacare, the trump administration can decide not to enforce that penalty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, the irs already took a small step in that direction earlier this year. the agency said it will not reject silent returns — tax returns on which a person declines to say whether they have insurance.the irs explained in a statement that this year, for the first time, the agency had been set to reject those silent returns. but trump's january executive order on obamacare changed that, telling the heads of executive branch offices to waive, defer, grand exemptions from, or delay parts of the act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "consistent with that, the irs has decided to make changes that would continue to allow electronic and paper returns to be accepted for processing in instances where a taxpayer doesn't indicate their coverage status, the irs said. however, legislative provisions of the aca law are still in force until changed by the congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in other words, a lot still won't change here — the penalties remain the law of the land.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, the irs' statement left considerable uncertainty about what enforcement would now look like, as the society for human resource management reported in february.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one other option here, cox says, is that the trump administration could loosen up the rules on who can get hardship exemptions. people with particularly tough circumstances — homelessness, domestic violence, bankruptcy — can currently apply to get an exemption from any penalties for not holding insurance. the trump administration could approve more people in more circumstances for those hardships, cox says. (likewise, the administration could also approve fewer people if it wanted to.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "were the administration to approve more waivers, it could mean fewer people in the marketplaces. and to the degree that that pulls healthy people out, it would create sicker pools that create more costly coverage, which in turn could cause more people to drop out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. let states be looser in defining essential health benefits", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the aca requires that health plans cover 10 essential health benefits — health services in basic, broad areas like emergency services, prescription drugs and maternity care. and the administration has a few paths for changing exactly what those are — changes that could weaken some people's health care but also maybe nudge more insurers into the marketplaces.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the federal government laid out and defined the benefits (known among health care wonks as ehbs), but the nitty-gritty of a state's essential health benefits can be found in its benchmark plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right now each state has picked a small group plan or similar plan that would have existed before the aca and used that as a benchmark for what all the plans in each state now have to cover, cox says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the trump administration could loosen that, giving plans much more wiggle room for what services they include or exclude, cox added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "price could come back in and say, 'we've changed how each state can define their [essential health benefit] plan as long as it looks reasonably like an employer plan,'  she says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the administration could also simply tweak the ehbs by broadening or narrowing the definitions of some of the 10 broad benefit categories.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, one of the 10 benefits set by law includes preventive care. but the law itself didn't say exactly what that meant — rather, the obama administration defined what exactly preventive services are through regulation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that means the trump white house could undo some of that through regulation, making particular benefits disappear. contraception, for example, is a part of the preventive service ehb, and the obama administration also made sure that in many plans, that birth control is copay-free. hhs secretary tom price has opposed that rule in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "once again, loosening rules around essential health benefits could reduce the kinds of things people get coverage for, but it could also potentially nudge more insurers into a state's exchanges, cox says. that could address a key obamacare problem: some areas of the country only have one insurer in their marketplaces.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "states can apply for waivers to deviate from the aca as written in some way — the idea, cox says, is to allow for some experimentation or innovation at the state level to improve the system. states could pass laws that change their health care system, then apply to the federal government for the waiver.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "price has promoted waivers as ways for states to alter their health care systems. under a trump administration that's no fan of the aca, approved waivers might look substantially different than they would have under obama.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden's plan is built on the idea of expanding the aca to reduce costs for patients and consumers — similar to what hillary clinton campaigned on in 2016. it would do things democrats have called for repeatedly since the aca was passed. among biden's proposals is a provision that would uncap federal help to pay for health insurance premiums — assistance now available only to those with incomes that are 400% of the poverty level, or about $50,000 for an individual.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here are some of the more controversial pieces of the biden health plan:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "although many of the democratic presidential candidates have expressed varying degrees of support for a medicare for all plan, nearly all have also endorsed creating a government-sponsored health plan, known colloquially as a public option, that would be available to people who buy their own health insurance. that eligible group would include anyone who doesn't get insurance through their job or who doesn't qualify for other government programs, like medicare or medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a public option was included in the version of the aca that passed the house in 2009. but its proponents could not muster the 60 votes needed to pass that option in the senate over gop objections — even though the democrats had 60 votes at the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden's public option, however, would be available to many more people than the 20 million or so who are now in the individual insurance market. according to the document put out by the campaign, this public option also would be available to those who don't like or can't afford their employer insurance, and to small businesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "most controversial, though, is that the 2.5 million people currently ineligible for either medicaid or private insurance subsidies because their states have chosen not to expand medicaid would be automatically enrolled in biden's public option, at no cost to them or the states where they live. also included automatically in the public option would be another 2 million people with low incomes who currently are eligible for aca coverage subsidies – and who would also be eligible for expanded medicaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that part of biden's proposal has prompted charges that the 14 states that have so far chosen not to expand medicaid would save money, compared with those that have already expanded the program, because expansion states have to pay 10% of the cost of that new population.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jennings, the democratic health strategist, argues that extra charge to states that previously expanded medicaid would be unavoidable under biden's plan, because people with low incomes in states that haven't expanded medicaid need coverage most. if you're not going to have everyone get a plan right away, you need to make sure those who are most vulnerable do, jennings says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the biden plan calls for eliminating the hyde amendment, an annual rider to the spending bill for the department of health and human services that forbids the use of federal funds to pay for most abortions. biden recently ran into some difficulty when his position on the hyde ammendment was unclear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beyond that, biden's plan also directly calls for the federal government to fund some abortions. [t]he public option will cover contraception and a woman's constitutional right to choose, his plan says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2010, the affordable care act very nearly failed to become law after an intraparty fight between democrats who supported and opposed federal funding for abortions. abortion opponents wanted firm guarantees in permanent law that no federal funds would ever be used for abortion; abortion-rights supporters called that a deal breaker. eventually a shaky compromise was reached.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and while it is true that there are now far fewer democrats in congress who oppose abortion than there were in 2010, the idea of even a democratic-controlled congress voting for federal abortion funding seems far-fetched. the current democratic-led house has declined even to include a repeal of the hyde amendment in this year's hhs spending bill, because it could not get through the gop-controlled senate or get signed by president trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when obama said in a speech to congress in september 2009 that people not in the u.s. legally would be ineligible for federal help with their purchase of health insurance under the aca, it prompted the infamous you lie! shout from rep. joe wilson, r-s.c..", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the rap on biden for most of the year was that he was the candidate of restoration, looking to return to the good old obama days. then the pandemic happened, george floyd was killed, and the country was forced to confront systemic racism. all of a sudden, biden, as the head of the party that believes in activist government, was given a new opportunity to recast his agenda with a forward-looking vision of what government should do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the thing about the american people is, we really don't like government as a concept. we do love government, however, when there's an emergency, said elaine kamarck, a member of the democratic national committee who ran a program tasked with reinventing government in the clinton white house. so, whenever there's an emergency, the first question is, where's the government? and the first criticism is the government didn't do enough or the government screwed this up.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "allen was skeptical at first that biden could have a vision for the future, but no more: i do think the biden campaign has laid out a vision that is about pulling us all together and that does focus on the key elements that we need in order to restore a healthy, strong social contract. where we're pursuing simultaneously the objectives of saving lives, securing livelihoods, protecting liberties.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the battle lines are being drawn five months ahead of the midterms, with more americans than at any point in at least the last two decades saying they're enthusiastic about voting — and record numbers of voters say president trump and which party controls congress are big factors in their vote, according to a new pew research center survey released wednesday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "voters also are saying they want candidates to talk more about immigration and health care, two hot-button issues that have no simple solutions or easily navigable middle grounds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "just wednesday, the president backed down from his zero tolerance immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of families, while adults who crossed the border illegally are held for adjudication. a long-term comprehensive solution, however, remains out of reach. on healthcare, republicans have failed so far to repeal and replace the affordable care act, but they did strip out the mandate to buy insurance, which policy experts warn could raise the prices of premiums in october, a month before this fall's elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "overall, slightly more than half of americans (51 percent) told pew they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual, the highest share saying so in at least the last 20 years since pew has been asking the question.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "generally, in midterms, the party out of power is far more fired up. that's been the case in each of the last three midterms — which have all been wave elections resulting in control of at least one chamber of congress changing hands.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2006, when democrats benefited from the spiraling iraq war and president george w. bush's declining approval numbers to take control of congress, a slightly lower number of democrats than today said they were more enthusiastic than usual (47 percent). but they far outnumbered republicans in who said they were more enthusiastic in 2006 (30 percent), a 17-point advantage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2010, when republicans won a whopping 63 seats in the house and regained control of that chamber, the gop was ahead on this question by 13 points (55 to 42 percent). and in 2014, when republicans won back the senate, they had an 8-point overall advantage (45 to 37 percent).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the bottom line is democrats today are as enthusiastic about voting as republicans were in 2010, but republicans are also fired up, which could mitigate gop losses in the house and help them protect their slim senate majority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both parties also see who controls congress as consequential, with a record 68 percent saying so. that number has been steadily on the rise in the past two decades, evidence that elections have become far more nationalized since the bill clinton impeachment and through bush v. gore, 9/11, the iraq war, obamacare and trump. politics just isn't so local anymore.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "democrats need to win nearly two dozen seats to take control of the house. they are facing a very difficult map in the senate, defending seats in 26 states, many of which trump won handily in 2016. republicans are defending just nine senate seats.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "putting those numbers in context again shows republicans' support for trump to be pretty strong. consider that that 52 percent seeing their vote as one for trump is nearly 20 points higher than the percentage of the gop who saw their vote as one for bush in 2006 and is also higher than the percentage of democrats who said their votes in 2010 and 2014 were to support obama. that could further insulate republicans from massive losses this year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "since taking office, president joe biden has signed a long list of executive orders to try to fulfill his core campaign promises or at least to signal their priority in his administration. today, health care is in the spotlight. president biden is signing two executive actions. one aims to increase access to health insurance through the affordable care act and increase access to medicaid. the other is a memorandum to expand access to reproductive health. npr health policy reporter selena simmons-duffin is with us for details. good morning, selena.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "selena simmons-duffin, byline: good morning, rachel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: what can you tell us? let's start off with the executive order on the aca.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simmons-duffin: so the big news there is that the biden administration is opening up a special enrollment period on healthcare.gov. that is the federally run health insurance exchange. starting february 15, americans will have three months to sign up for a health plan if their state uses healthcare.gov as its obamacare exchange - most states do. that will be open for three months until mid-may. and that means you don't have to prove you've just lost coverage or had a qualifying life event. you could just go in, choose a plan, get covered. and this is the first time there's been a special enrollment period on the federal exchange during the pandemic. the trump administration faced pressure to have one in the spring, but it never did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: and this executive order addresses medicaid as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simmons-duffin: yeah, that's right. medicaid has turned out to be key in preventing millions of people who've lost jobs from the coronavirus recession from losing their health coverage as well. that's the health plan for low-income people. and last night, the white house put out this fact sheet about the executive order, and it seems pretty sweeping. it's asking federal agencies to look at any rules or policies that make it harder for people to have access to health insurance, either through aca exchanges or medicaid. and that includes the controversial work requirements that the trump administration encouraged states to take up in the last few years. and there are other ways that biden has said he would like to shore up the aca. but this is a significant start in terms of what he can do from the executive branch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: ok, so the medicaid and the aca access, that's encompassed in one executive action. and then there's this memorandum on reproductive health, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simmons-duffin: yeah, that's right. so first of all, this one rescinds the global gag rule or mexico city policy that bans federal dollars from going to international organizations that provide or refer people for abortions. and this is kind of a yo-yo issue. so republican presidents reinstate it, democrats rescind it. biden is getting rid of it. he's also asking for a review of a trump policy that prevented organizations that promote or provide abortions here in the u.s. from having access to title x funding. so biden wants to get rid of that policy as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "martin: so, i mean, we've talked about this on the show. president biden, other presidents before him, use executive actions when, frankly, on a lot of these issues, they don't think they can get the support in time in congress. so when you think about these executive orders, when you think about president biden and what he said about his agenda, where does health policy fall?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simmons-duffin: yeah, that's right. it's kind of hard to remember that health policy was supposed to be the issue of the 2020 election. that's not exactly how it shook out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "simmons-duffin: but, yes, i think that biden is going to be using executive action. and some health experts that i've talked to have said that trump gave him a playbook for how to do this. all that trump did on the issue was through the executive branch. he didn't get a single piece of big health legislation through congress. so biden has that model to work from to shape this issue in a totally different way with totally different priorities and values. and also part of what he's doing is getting this on people's radar. there are 26 million uninsured people in this country. it's a pandemic. a lot of people don't know that the affordable care act is still the law. and so i'm expecting to see a big push to try to get people to know that this open enrollment period is coming on february 15.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i actually agree that we need to revisit the emergency powers. i don't think it's that they - there aren't limits, but i think they're written in a way that give the president even more power than people realize because no one really expected a president to use emergency powers this - in this partisan or i would say irresponsible a way.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "lowe: when you frame it like that, then i believe it's a positive thing. but i don't think that that's what these bills necessarily do. if you look at these paid parental leave acts, i mean, obamacare architect jonathan gruber found that women bear 100 percent of the economic burden of all paid parental leave programs because disproportionately women are the ones to take time off. there is a reason why 10 percent more women are in management positions in america than in scandinavian countries, and it's because women are kept in the workplace, and a lot of these programs disincentivize women from staying in the workplace.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "president trump and former vice president joe biden met for their second and final debate as tens of millions of americans have already voted. a deeply divided country begins its final sprint to election day amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it's unclear how many voters have yet to make up their minds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here are five takeaways from the debate in nashville, tenn., a much different — and far more civil — night than the last encounter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. there was a real debate", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the first debate between trump and biden was unwatchable. it was overwhelmed by interruptions and cross-talk, disregard for the moderator and name-calling — all largely on the part of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "new rules imposed by the commission on presidential debates included a mute button operated by a staffer for the cpd that turned off each candidate's microphone for the first two minutes of his opponent's speaking time at the beginning of each debate topic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moderator kristen welker of nbc news skillfully kept the conversation moving. she followed up and pressed for answers and fairly gave both candidates opportunities to respond to the other's comments. welker pushed back when the candidates attempted to run over time or tried to change the subject. she was firm and her no-nonsense approach held the candidates to task.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump dropped in the polls after the first debate and got advice from republicans to tone it down this time. thursday night he was more measured and attempted to stay on message. biden was also more disciplined and came prepared to address personal attacks the trump campaign signaled beforehand it was going to make about his son hunter's business dealings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. the coronavirus is still the driving force in the election", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the 2020 election remains focused on trump's handling of the coronavirus, and it was the subject of welker's first question. both candidates tested negative for the coronavirus prior to entering the venue on thursday, and those in the small audience were required to wear masks. members of the trump family adhered to the rules, donning masks and appearing to keep them on after conspicuously refusing to do so during the first debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the two candidates' approaches and attitudes could not have been more different on the pandemic. biden warned a dark winter was looming and that with 220,000 americans dead the president had failed from the outset to take control of the response to the virus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the united states of the america, biden said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump repeatedly claimed that his approach saved millions of lives and that we're rounding the turn. after testing positive himself following the last debate, the president acknowledged he had personal experience with the disease but argued it was manageable, saying, i had it. and i got better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he repeated his claim that a vaccine was weeks away, but when pressed admitted: it's not a guarantee. trump said it has a good chance by the end of the year to be approved, and that he had a plan lined up for the military to help distribute millions of doses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president attempted to pivot to the economic impact of returning to restrictions, arguing that biden wanted to shut down the country, saying: we can't keep this country closed. this is a massive country with a massive economy. people are losing their jobs.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden dubbed his plan for the affordable care act bidencare during thursday night's debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president vowed to protect preexisting conditions, but biden hammered him for not presenting a plan to replace the aca despite four years of indicating one was imminent. the supreme court is slated to hear a challenge to the law brought by the trump administration one week after the election. as he's done before, biden linked health care concerns over the coronavirus pandemic to the administration's efforts to dismantle the aca.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "earlier on thursday, the president released raw video from a taped interview with the cbs news program 60 minutes where he was pressed about his position on the aca. trump declared, i hope that they end it. it'll be so good if they end it. and during the debate he continued to sharply criticize the aca, which 10 years after it was implemented is more popular and has proven to be a political plus for democrats.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we'd like to do is terminate it, the president said, also noting that he terminated the individual mandate that required people to enroll in coverage plans or pay a fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president maintained biden's plan amounted to socialized medicine that would threaten medicare, the popular government health coverage for seniors. he equated biden's plan with that of other democrats who during the primary pushed for a more sweeping medicare for all program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but biden disavowed those proposals, saying, i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them on health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. trump attacked biden as a typical politician, engaged in corruption", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump won in 2016 in part by arguing he wasn't a politician, that he was a businessman who was going to washington to drain the swamp. he has been trying in the past couple of weeks to reprise that strategy, and to paint biden as a corrupt washington figure who has a 47-year career in government without much to show for it. even though reelection races for incumbents are usually referendums on their first terms, trump has talked less about his own record and more about biden's.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "going into the debate, the trump campaign signaled the president would home in on biden's son hunter's work with overseas businesses, arguing it led to the former vice president personally enriching himself. the president pointed to reports in the new york post about alleged emails from hunter that described efforts to create a business venture in china that included money for his father and his uncle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the authenticity of the material cited in the news reports has not been verified — it was given to the post by trump's attorney and ally, rudy giuliani. and biden's campaign denies the allegations. one of the trump campaign's guests at the debate was a man who claims to be a former business associate of hunter biden who said he had direct knowledge that joe biden was involved in his son's business dealings and was planning to meet with senate gop investigators about the matter.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden was ready for the attack. i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life, he said. he argued that trump's focus on the biden family was intended to distract from the problems facing voters' families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president waved off biden's answers as changing the subject like other typical politicians, saying, i'm not a typical politician. that's why i got elected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president made multiple references to biden receiving millions from foreign governments, but didn't provide any evidence to support his claims. biden pointed out that many of trump's allegations about the biden family were proven false during the impeachment probe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with less than two weeks before election day, trump's effort to change the focus of the campaign may not connect and could have been confusing to voters because his charges were less than clear. also many voters are focused on the economy and health care, not on unsupported allegations of corruption.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden did use the exchange to bring up a new york times report that revealed trump himself had a chinese bank account, which raised questions about trump's own tax payments to china and refusal to release his u.s. tax returns. the president said he believed he closed the china account and claimed again he will release his returns once an irs audit is completed. the irs is on record that the audit does not prevent trump from releasing his returns now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. the debate may not matter", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more than 40 million people have already voted, and recent polls show a very small sliver of the electorate is persuadable this close to the election. even biden appeared bored, and near the end of the debate checked his watch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both campaigns chiefly wanted to avoid any major mistakes in the last debate, and both candidates delivered. now their focus in the final stretch will be to get out supporters and see how states process an unprecedented number of ballots from those voting early or by mail to avoid lengthy lines during a continuing national health crisis.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cassidy: so i certainly would consider it, but the white house has specifically said that if anybody has a hospital bill related to covid, the federal government will pay 100% of it. i have mixed feelings about that because now you're better off being uninsured because you have no deductible and co-pay because 100% of your expense is going to be covered by the federal government. but if they want to open up the exchanges, i would not object. but the president...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "inskeep: there do seem to be lessons here for the united states as american states and different businesses begin to reopen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "feng: there is. first is the difficulty of catching these asymptomatic cases, people who exhibit no symptoms whatsoever. five of the six new cases in wuhan reported this week were very difficult to detect because they'd had no symptoms whatsoever. the other is, even with extensive testing, as they are doing in china, it can be difficult to reach the right people. this was an elderly man who was in his home. and so local officials did not test him despite the fact that he felt sick for the last two months.", "augmented": []}
