DAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nLet's chat now with one of President-elect Donald Trump's most high-profile advisers. It's former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who, like Trump, led a political upheaval. That was 1994. Gingrich helped Republicans take control of both houses of Congress for the first time in decades on a set of promises called the Contract with America. Gingrich spoke with our MORNING EDITION colleague Rachel Martin. Rachel began by asking what he thinks Trump needs to do in the first hundred days to satisfy those who voted him into office.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think he needs to set a direction that allows people who are deeply opposed to Obamacare to realize it's gradually going to be reformed and rethought. A lot of the initial phase, frankly, I suspect - I don't know for a fact - but I suspect that the opening 48 or 72 hours will have so many executive orders repealing Obama's executive orders that the average conservative will be giddy with excitement.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Donald Trump has been favoring a lot of so-called disrupters in his Cabinet appointments. A couple of them stand out. Rick Perry as the man to lead the Department of Energy - he's someone who's advocated shutting the agency down. Scott Pruitt has been tapped to lead the EPA - Pruitt at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. He's repeatedly sued to weaken EPA regulations. What is Donald Trump's message in these two particular appointments?\n\nGINGRICH: That he was elected by people who believe Washington has too much power. The Washington bureaucracy is too arrogant and imperial. This was an election that had consequence. It probably rivals the Reagan election of '80 and the FDR election of '32 in that sense.\n\nObama, by the way, had a similar election but couldn't sustain it, partly because he kept lying.\n\nAnd this will be a real test for Trump. If Trump remains honest and seems like a person who's authentic, he's going to go a long way. If under the pressure of this city he starts dissembling and saying things that aren't true, he'll decay as much as Obama did well on that.\n\nMARTIN: Well, on that, how much does the perception of honesty have to do with transparency? There have been all kinds of calls for Donald Trump to be more transparent about his own financial holdings. Do you think that he needs to open the books? Does he need to be more transparent?\n\nGINGRICH: I think they're going to have to find some system that convinces most reasonable people that they're operating within bounds of integrity and bounds that prevent corruption and prevent misuse of power.\n\nMARTIN: So what does that look like?\n\nGINGRICH: Well, I don't know. I mean, I've been suggesting that you find people like Attorney General Mukasey who are widely respected and have a panel of, like, five of them who have total access to everything and who are able to say on a regular basis, maybe monthly - you know, don't go over these bounds. This has to be fixed. That can't be done that way.\n\nMARTIN: Is that something you've suggested to the transition team?\n\nGINGRICH: It's something I've talked to the transition team about.\n\nMARTIN: And what was their response?\n\nGINGRICH: I think that's one of many things they're looking at.\n\nMARTIN: But up until now, Donald Trump has just essentially said trust me.\n\nGINGRICH: Right. That will not last. This is not a country that wanders around trusting people with power. This is a country that wants accountability. They want some sense - now, again, he is unique. And I totally defend him against those who, for example, want him to put his holdings in a blind trust, which is an absurd...\n\nMARTIN: Why is that absurd?\n\nGINGRICH: Well, a large part of his holdings are Trump Golf clubs, Trump Hotels. I mean, we have never quite had anyone of this scale to occupy the White House. And it's going to require us to think about - how do you deal with this in a way that's effective and that serves the interests of the country but also meets some kind of practical, common-sense test?\n\nMARTIN: You said earlier this week on The Diane Rehm Show that Donald Trump could potentially use the power of the pardon if anyone in his administration seemed to be violating conflict of interest laws or protocols. Can you explain that?\n\nGINGRICH: Sure. The Constitution gives the president of the United States an extraordinarily wide grant of authority to use the power of the pardon. I'm not saying he should. I'm not saying he will. It also allows the president, in a national security moment, to say to somebody - go do X, even if it's technically against the law. And I'm - here's your pardon because I'm ordering you as commander in chief to go do this.\n\nMARTIN: Does that sit well with you, the idea that President Trump could pardon a member of his family or his administration if that person was acting in the best interest of his corporation but not the government?\n\nGINGRICH: Well, look, I'm not advocating it. I'm pointing out that it is within the Constitution and that we should be aware of it. But I think there needs to be a re-evaluation of both sides. He has to understand and his family has to understand that there is a public interest which transcends them. At the same time, we have to understand that this is a new situation we've never seen before. And the rules were written for people who were dramatically less successful, who literally do not work.\n\nMARTIN: He was supposed to hold a press conference last week where he was going to outline how he intended to create a bright line between himself and his business. He canceled that press conference. There are no plans for when he will hold it. Do you think that he needs to come out and make an announcement and to do it soon?\n\nGINGRICH: Well, I suspect - I don't know this - but I suspect that they got drowned in picking the Cabinet. But they're going to have to do it sooner or later. I mean, the longer they wait, the greater the irritation will be and the more concerned people will be. So it's not to their advantage, you know, to get to the inaugural without having sorted this out.\n\nBut they need to have the help of pretty wise outsiders who are able, in a dispassionate way, to help them sort through this. I mean, they've never done anything like this before. And I certainly don't expect them, on phase one, to fully appreciate how complicated it is and how dangerous it is for the country. This is a country in which 75 percent of the people believe there's widespread corruption. We have got to go back to re-establishing a sense of trust. That has to be an assignment Trump takes personally. And that has to be more than trust me because trust me never works in the long run as a model. It's just - it's not possible.\n\nMARTIN: What do you anticipate your role being in the administration going forward?\n\nGINGRICH: Strategic planner.\n\nMARTIN: That's awfully big. Can you narrow that down? What part of the government strategy are you going to be planning?\n\nGINGRICH: It is big. But on the other hand, you know, as speaker of the House and then later having worked with the Bush administration, I've been working on these issues for 58 years. You know, I have - you know, and I've really spent a long time trying to think about - what do we need to do to get this government to be effective?\n\nMARTIN: You say you've been working on these issues. Others might say you've been working in the swamp, to use Donald Trump's language.\n\nGINGRICH: Although he - I'm told he now disclaims that. He now says it was cute but he doesn't want to use it anymore.\n\nMARTIN: He doesn't want to use drain the swamp anymore?\n\nGINGRICH: I don't know. I saw - somebody that note last night because I'd written a - what I thought was a very cute tweet about the alligators are complaining.\n\nMARTIN: (Laughing).\n\nGINGRICH: And somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.\n\nMARTIN: Did you take offense as an alligator?\n\nGINGRICH: I'm becoming more statesman-like in this interview. But I've noticed on a couple of fronts, like people chanting lock her up, that he's in a different role now. And maybe he feels that as president - you know, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators and swamps.\n\nI, personally, as a sense of humor, like the alligator and swamp language. I think it actually - I think it vividly illustrates the problem because all the people in this city who are the alligators are going to hate the swamp being drained. And there's going to be constant fighting over it. But - you know, he is my leader. And if he decides to drop the swamp and the alligator, I will drop the swamp and the alligator.\n\nMARTIN: Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.\n\nThank you so much for your time.\n\nGINGRICH: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nGREENE: That was my colleague Rachel Martin talking to Newt Gingrich.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Biden Rides Wave Of Endorsements From Former Rivals Into Super Tuesday\n\nJoe Biden has seen a surge of momentum following endorsements from some former rival candidates. That's left the Biden presidential campaign with new expectations for Super Tuesday.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nIt's Super Tuesday, and no state offers Democrats a bigger delegate prize than California. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid is in California in Los Angeles. She's been traveling with the campaign of Joe Biden and joins us now.\n\nHey, Asma.\n\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: A lot's happened with the Biden campaign in the last four days - that big win in South Carolina, now endorsements from former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. What's the mood among his campaign staff you're talking to?\n\nKHALID: Well, it's really such a change. I mean, parts of Iowa and New Hampshire felt pretty somber. The events just didn't have the type of energy that I've begun to see in the last few days. It has really changed dramatically so quickly. By the way, Ari, I should mention I'm on a bus.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah, I can hear that rumbling in the background.\n\nKHALID: That's the background noise you probably hear (laughter). I was in Dallas last night, where Biden got the endorsement of Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke. And, you know, when you listen to the former vice president, he kind of seems to speak with a renewed vigor. Here's a snippet.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: The Democrats want to name a nominee who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it, take on the NRA and the gun manufacturers, protect our children, will stand up for the middle class, not raise their taxes and make promises that can't be kept. Then join us.\n\nKHALID: And, you know, within that answer, Ari, I think there were obviously - there was, obviously, a subtext of Bernie Sanders. You know, he is somebody who wants to replace Obamacare with Medicare for All and has these bold promises that Joe Biden is sort of skeptical of; whether or not he can actually - whether or not any politician could actually implement them. I think what's most notable in terms of the new energy around Biden is that we have very quickly seen the establishment - we have seen other moderate candidates in this field coalesce around Joe Biden as the single alternative to Bernie Sanders ahead of Super Tuesday. And that has happened with remarkable speed.\n\nSHAPIRO: And what are you hearing from voters that you're talking to?\n\nKHALID: Well, the rallies are certainly busy. And when I talk to voters - I will say earlier on in Iowa and New Hampshire, I heard a lot about electability. I continue to hear about electability, but it seems like people are more convinced in their choices for other reasons. Yesterday, at a rally in Houston, I met Pablo Fernandez. He's a Biden supporter who told me he likes the former vice president's message of unity. He feels like a lot of politics these days is polarizing, and he wants somebody who's going to be a unifier.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPABLO FERNANDEZ: People call the tea partiers the deplorables, but I really feel that both sides, both extremes are equally deplorable because they're hate-filled. We don't need hate. We need unison.\n\nKHALID: And so, again, Ari, that's kind of an implicit rebuke there of the Sanders wing of the party and some of Bernie Sanders' online supporters, whom, you know, many folks within the Democratic Party feel have really been causing, you know, divisiveness within the party itself.\n\nSHAPIRO: This surge of support for Biden has really just come in the last few days, and the Sanders campaign has been well-resourced and energized for a while. Some key states voting today, including California, appear strong for Sanders. So what are Biden's expectations tonight?\n\nKHALID: Yeah, you know, you mentioned California, and I should say that Bernie Sanders seems to have led both in Nevada, as well as some of the polling we've seen even yesterday that looks at Latino voters. And a sizable chunk of the electorate in both California and Texas are Latino voters.\n\nBiden hopes for some wins in Southern states, states that specifically have a large, sizable population of black voters. We saw in South Carolina, he seems to have a strength there. His intent is, obviously, to collect delegates in as many states as he can, and he will need to reach a 15% threshold in order to collect any delegates. Prior to some of these other candidates getting out of the race, there were some questions about whether he could reach that delegate threshold in a state like California. Things are certainly looking much better for him in terms of reaching that 15% viability in a lot more places.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR's Asma Khalid in Los Angeles, where she's been traveling with the Biden campaign. And we're going to be hearing from reporters traveling with the other campaigns in other parts of the show.\n\nThank you, Asma.\n\nKHALID: You're welcome.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR.

Coronavirus Is A Key Campaign Issue: What's Joe Biden's Plan?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAs Election Day nears, the pandemic looms large. Amid a surge in new cases, the coronavirus has changed the way we live, work and — perhaps — how some Americans will vote.\n\nAs President Trump makes the case that his leadership has saved lives in the pandemic and ushered in record-fast vaccine and therapeutics development, Joe Biden has described Trump's handling of COVID-19 as totally irresponsible and points to American's health as the nation's top domestic issue.\n\nTrump's approach to handling the pandemic is clear from his record. His administration has delegated much of the authority for the coronavirus response to states, including testing and contact tracing. He's invested heavily in vaccine development. He signed two coronavirus relief packages and has indicated he'd sign another one after the election.\n\nBut what would Biden do? Biden's campaign has a seven-point plan to beat COVID-19 and other proposals for health care and economic recovery that support that vision. NPR asked his advisers for details on his approach, which includes some familiar elements, as well as some less-expected ones.\n\n1. Set consistent, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks\n\nIf Biden wins the election, You would see an approach that's driven by science and by scientists, says physician Vivek Murthy, who is a key adviser to the Biden campaign on COVID-19.\n\nAnd he'd focus on uniting states around some common practices, says Ezekiel Emanuel, a physician and University of Pennsylvania professor who has briefed Biden on health policy but has no formal campaign position. Instead of different states doing different things, the goal would be to get all the states singing from the same hymnal, Emanuel says.\n\nFor instance, Biden's plan says it would direct the CDC to provide specific guidance — based on the degree of viral spread in a community — for when to open or close businesses and schools, when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-home orders may be called for.\n\nSocial distancing is not a light switch. It is a dial, the Biden campaign states in its plan. It would create a national pandemic dashboard to share this information. This is a strategy recommended by a top group of public health experts, who released a framework for assessing community risk.\n\nAnd, Biden is calling on every American to wear a mask when they are close to people outside their household. He says he'd work with every governor to make this mandatory in their state. Many states already have mask mandates, but at a time when research suggests that universal masking could save more than 100,000 lives, there's currently no nationwide coordination or requirement.\n\n2. Seriously ramp up testing\n\nThe Biden campaign says the goal is to ensure that all Americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing. It would work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in next-generation testing including home tests and instant tests.\n\nIt's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID, Biden said on CBS' 60 Minutes. If there's a long lag time, a person may spread the disease unwittingly while waiting for results.\n\nThere are currently several home test kits that give quick results without being sent to a laboratory in development, but none are yet FDA-approved. While there has been a significant expansion in testing, we're still encountering shortages, Murthy says. Testing is still not available and affordable to all people across the country, he says.\n\n3. Establish a U.S. public health jobs corps\n\nThe Biden campaign pledges to mobilize 100,000 Americans to work with local organizations around the country to perform contact tracing and other services that would help address unmet needs in populations at high risk for COVID-19.\n\nThese workers would initially help with contact tracing around the country, and would also shore up local health departments to address other pandemic needs, Murthy says. We know that people are struggling, he says, and the idea is to empower local communities and local health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing.\n\nImagine a public health workforce that was also helping train school officials in how to reopen safely, Murthy says. Or helping run public education campaigns about a vaccine and how to stay safe in the pandemic. Think about a workforce that was diverse, that looked like the country that we're trying to serve, Murthy says.\n\nThis investment would be paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthier Americans.\n\n4. Help people get health insurance\n\nMillions of American have lost health insurance during the pandemic. Biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of COBRA coverage for the duration of the crisis. So when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in and the pandemic, says Stef Feldman, Biden's national policy director.\n\nIn addition, Biden would push to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. That means expanding coverage, Murthy says, for instance by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. Biden would also push for expansion of Medicaid in states that have still yet to do so, his advisers say, and he has proposed making Medicare coverage available to Americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65).\n\nDuring the pandemic, several governors asked the Trump administration to reopen the federal Obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period.\n\nOne of the most immediate steps Vice President Biden would be able to take is to reopen open enrollment as needed so people who have lost insurance can sign up for new coverage, Feldman says, calling it a basic step that President Trump has refused to do.\n\n5. Create a caregiving workforce\n\nDuring the pandemic, Biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. At the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay, his campaign plan notes.\n\nThere are thousands of people who would like to receive care in their homes, who are covered by Medicaid, explains Murthy, but are on a waiting list that is as long as five years. Vice President Biden would work with states to close that gap and make sure that we have Medicaid-funded, home-based care providers to care for our older loved ones, Murthy says.\n\nBiden supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and also supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections. The Biden campaign says these initiatives would cost $775 billion over 10 years and would be paid for, in part, by rolling back tax breaks on high earners.\n\nExpanding opportunities in the female-dominated caregiving workforce would play a dual role in both helping families, and helping improve women's employment outlook, explains Sherry Glied, who is dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, noting that this pandemic-fueled economic crisis has hit women harder.\n\nThis really gives us an opportunity to sort of address two policy objectives with one policy step, Glied says. She is not an adviser to Biden, but has written a perspective in the New England Journal of Medicine on how policies to address the impact of COVID-19 could shift under a new president.\n\n6. Bolster resources for vaccine distribution and PPE production\n\nStates will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. There are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. For instance, states may need freezers to store their vaccines, and given how many people are hesitant to be vaccinated, they will need public education materials and guidance. Currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance.\n\nThe Biden campaign proposes investing $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.\n\nThe Biden campaign also wants to solve the PPE shortages that have plagued the U.S. health care system since the pandemic began, stating that it would produce more of these critical supplies, rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.\n\nWhile Trump made limited use of the Defense Production Act to increase ventilator production, Biden says he'd use it to increase production of masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment so that supply exceeds demand.
After Low-Key Lobbying Effort, Trump Says He Was 'Let Down' By Senators\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nBlindsided by the latest collapse of a Republican health care bill, President Trump took to Twitter to voice his frustration. Trump complained of being let down by a handful of Republican lawmakers. And he insisted that the fight over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is not over.\n\nTrump had just finished discussing health care with seven Republican lawmakers over dinner Monday when Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Jerry Moran, R-Kansas — who were not at the meeting — announced they would be voting against the measure to repeal and replace Obamacare. With two other Republican senators already on record in opposition, the Monday-night development effectively killed the Senate bill.\n\nTrump acknowledged he was caught off guard by the latest GOP defections.\n\nFor seven years, I've been hearing repeal and replace from Congress, Trump said. And then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it. So that's disappointing.\n\nThe White House dinner was part of a low-key and ultimately unsuccessful lobbying effort by the president. Press secretary Sean Spicer insists Trump was actively working for the bill's passage, even though he spent much of the weekend watching the U.S. Women's Open golf tournament at his Bedminster, N.J., resort.\n\nHe's been extremely engaged throughout the weekend, making phone calls, talking to folks, meeting with his team, getting updates, Spicer said.\n\nTrump also spent valuable time on Monday at a White House event designed to showcase domestic manufacturing. He posed for pictures behind the wheel of a gleaming fire engine built by Pierce Manufacturing of Wisconsin. By coincidence, the White House had staged a similar photo-op with the president at the end of March, the day before a different Obamacare replacement bill died in the House.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president is now encouraging Senate Republicans to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving any discussion of a replacement for a later date. That idea already appears doomed, as at least three GOP senators have come out against it.\n\nThe Senate passed a repeal bill in 2015, but it was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama. The Congressional Budget Office warned in January that repealing Obamacare without a replacement would be highly destabilizing for the individual insurance market, leaving 32 million more Americans without health coverage within a decade. (That's significantly more than the uninsured projections for Republican House and Senate replacement bills.)\n\nThe president has repeatedly said that Congress must do something to avoid a health care meltdown.\n\nObamacare is a big failure and it has to be changed, he told reporters Tuesday. I'm not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say, 'How do we fix it?'\n\nResearchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation dispute that ominous picture. They argue the individual insurance market is stabilizing in most parts of the country, although deliberate moves by the administration could undermine that. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben made the same point in March.\n\nUnder the Senate's procedural rules, Republicans can't repeal all of the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority. It takes at least 60 votes, for example, to repeal the provision requiring insurance companies to cover everyone. Leaving that piece in place while doing away with the requirement that all Americans have insurance could trigger a sharp spike in premiums.\n\nTrump called on the Senate to change its rules so any bill could be passed with just 51 votes. He neglected to mention that the failed repeal-and-replace measure fell short of that simple majority.
Obamacare Must 'Fall,' Trump Administration Tells Supreme Court\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:43 a.m. ET\n\nIn a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump administration has reaffirmed its position that the Affordable Care Act in its entirety is illegal because Congress eliminated the individual tax penalty for failing to purchase medical insurance.\n\nSolicitor General Noel Francisco, the government's chief advocate before the Supreme Court, said in a brief that the other provisions of Obamacare are impossible to separate from the individual mandate and that it necessarily follows that the rest of the ACA must also fall.\n\nShortly after the brief appeared on the court's docket late Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement: President Trump and the Republicans' campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty.\n\nIn a speech on the lawsuit Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden said he was proud of the ACA and denounced the administration's position. It's cruel, it's heartless, and it's callous, he said.\n\nThe case before the high court began with a lawsuit brought by 20 states, led by Texas, calling for the elimination of the ACA. It has been consolidated for argument with another case brought by 17 states, led by California, seeking to preserve the law. The court is likely to hear the case in the fall.\n\nPresident Trump, in this cruel lawsuit, has shown us who he really is, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. He added that they intend to prevail with the facts, the law and the American people on our side.\n\nThe lawsuit was first heard in Texas in 2018 by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor, who struck down the entire ACA as unconstitutional. At the time, the Trump administration had not taken that all-or-nothing position but since then has come to support the lawsuit.\n\nEliminating the ACA would end medical insurance for more than 20 million Americans. It would also end widely popular provisions of the law, such as extending parents' coverage to children up to the age of 26 and prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans have long said they want to repeal and replace Obamacare but have yet to offer legislation addressing what would take its place.\n\nThe cases before the Supreme Court are State of California, et al., v. State of Texas, et al. (19-840) and State of Texas, et al., v. State of California, et al. (19-1019).
Sen. McConnell's Plan B To Repeal Affordable Care Act Fails\n\nThree Republican senators Tuesday effectively scuttled Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. This was hours after the Senate's bill to repeal and replace Obamacare was blocked when two more GOP senators came out in opposition to it.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nWhat's emerging on Capitol Hill today is a portrait of a Republican party struggling to find a way to govern. So here's what happened in the last just 24 hours. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was hoping to vote on the Senate's revised health care bill this week. And then last night, he had to abandon that bill when two senators announced that they wouldn't support it. Now his plan is to repeal the Affordable Care Act now and figure out what to replace it with later. But it looks like he doesn't have the votes for that either. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis joins us now to talk about the fallout over health care. Hello there, Sue.\n\nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: So what's the calculus behind moving forward even when it seems like you don't have the votes to pass any of the things that you want?\n\nDAVIS: You know, there are put up or shut up moments in life, Audie, and this is one for the United States Senate and Republicans in the Senate. McConnell is essentially asking Republicans to vote for something they've already voted for. This is a rehash of a 2015 vote in which every Republican senator except one - Susan Collins of Maine - voted to essentially repeal all of Obamacare and didn't offer much to replace it with. And one advocate of this strategy is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. And this is what he had to say today.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRAND PAUL: If you voted for it a year and a half ago, you got a lot of explaining to do when you go home if you're going to vote differently this time. We ran four elections on repealing Obamacare. I think we can repeal Obamacare. It's not even a complete repeal. It's a partial repeal. So I think, yes, if you voted for it in 2015, you should vote for it again.\n\nDAVIS: Two of those senators who did vote for it came out today and said they would not a second time around. That's Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. So once again, Republicans in a familiar place - they don't have the votes.\n\nCORNISH: The thing is the first time around, all of these senators knew that it would be vetoed by President Obama, right? Not exactly high stakes.\n\nDAVIS: Right. And, you know, Obamacare has embedded itself deeper in the nation since that vote in 2015. I talked to one of those senators who's now ready to vote no, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. And she is one of these senators who's saying, look, now is the time to find the bipartisan consensus on health care. This is what she said.\n\nLISA MURKOWSKI: Republicans have to admit that some of the things in the ACA we actually liked. And the Democrats have to admit that some of the things that they voted for in the ACA are broken and need to be fixed.\n\nDAVIS: You know, that kind of bipartisan consensus doesn't seem like it's going to happen right away. There are some early signs that things are going to move next in that direction. Lamar Alexander, who's a committee chairman, announced that he's going to start having hearings soon on what they can fix in the health care system.\n\nCORNISH: All the reporting on this makes it sound like there's just a ton of infighting. What was the atmosphere on the Capitol today?\n\nDAVIS: You know, I talked to a lot of Republicans. The word you hear a lot is they say they're disappointed. They did the best we could. But there's a lot of simmering tensions going on here beneath the surface, Audie. There is frustration between the conservative and moderate wings blaming each other for why this went down. There's frustration from some Republicans towards Mitch McConnell and how he put this bill together.\n\nThere's a lot of frustration at the president, that the - President Trump simply didn't do enough to build the public case for why Republicans should pass this bill. And there's also a lot of frustration from the grassroots. Already one of those groups, the Senate Conservative Fund, announced today they're going to try and find primary challengers for every Republican who votes no when McConnell brings this to the floor.\n\nCORNISH: You mention the grassroots. How do Republicans plan to explain this failure - right? - something they promised their voters for so long when they go home?\n\nDAVIS: This is the question that's going to dog the Republican Party through the midterms if they don't act on health care. McConnell today said they'll focus on what they have done and try to turn the page. Here's what he said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL: Well, we have a new Supreme Court justice. We have 14 repeals of regulations. And we're only six months into it. Last time I looked, the Congress goes on for two years. We'll be moving on to comprehensive tax reform and to infrastructure. There's much work left to be done for the American people, and we're ready to tackle it.\n\nDAVIS: In the very short term, the Senate's going to pivot away. They're going to try and pass a defense bill. They're going to try and raise the debt limit. And they're going to work on improving the nomination of incoming FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nCORNISH: NPR's Sue Davis at the Capitol. Thank you.\n\nDAVIS: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

On Who Gets To Be A 'Real American,' And Who Deserves A Helping Hand\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt York/AP Matt York/AP\n\nOne way to take the temperature of the Republican Party's ongoing tumult this election cycle is to consult The National Review, the conservative magazine founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley. The magazine has been so opposed to Donald Trump that it pitched its entire January issue against his candidacy. A number of right-leaning luminaries contributed, warning primary voters that the reality TV mogul's continued rise could doom the conservative project writ large.\n\nThe magazine's warnings have clearly gone unheeded by much of the Republican rank and file. But the Review is still at it. Earlier this month, it published an incendiary essay by Kevin Williamson, one of its most reliably provocative writers, titled Chaos in the Family, Chaos in the State: The White Working Class's Dysfunction.\n\nIn it, Williamson rails at white working-class voters for, in his telling, mooching off the government as their families collapse into disarray and drug addiction. He says their attraction to Trump is driven by an undue sense of grievance:\n\n[It is a lie] that the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn't. The white middle class may like the idea of Trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the Cathedral, they may sing hymns to Trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about globalists and — odious, stupid term — the Establishment, but nobody did this to them. They failed themselves. ... If you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy — which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog — you will come to an awful realization. ... The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die.\n\nTheir communities deserve to die. Yikes.\n\nAs Slate's Ben Mathis-Lilley has noted, among others, Williamson's essay is remarkable in that it echoes rhetoric long deployed against Americans who rely on financial assistance from the government — takers vs. makers, welfare queens — but here, that rhetoric is being weaponized against downscale white folks. (The essay is behind a paywall, but Mathis-Lilley quotes extensively from it.)\n\nWilliamson's piece predictably raised lots of eyebrows — in right-wing circles and beyond — and David A. French, also at the National Review, came to his colleague's defense in a post responding to the backlash. Kevin is right, French wrote. If getting a job means renting a U-Haul, rent the U-Haul. You have nothing to lose but your government check. (French doubled down again this week with a post titled, The Great White Working-Class Debate: Just Because I'm 'Nasty' Doesn't Mean I'm Wrong.)\n\nThese National Review offerings help demarcate the widening, well-documented chasm between the Republican Party's base and, with apologies to Williamson, its establishment. What's fascinating is the similarity of the charge on both sides of the fence. The base's ongoing complaint — that the party establishment is out of touch with the concerns of real Americans — and Williamson's screed essentially send the same message: Act right, or risk getting kicked out of the club.\n\nThe whole fracas reads like a fun house mirror version of John Ridley's notorious 2006 Esquire essay, The Manifesto of Ascendancy of the Modern American Nigger — or even Bill Cosby's infamous Pound Cake Speech. These were angry, very public screeds by prominent black folks against poorer black folks for their supposed moral shortcomings, manifestos that essentially drew a line in the sand indicating who gets to claim membership in real blackness, and who doesn't.\n\nThe Review pieces also offer up a rare, if crude, example of direct public engagement with white identity politics in (relatively) mainstream American political life. We don't tend to think of white folks' fights to secure government benefits and protections as identity politics, informed by a set of grievances specific to one's racial or ethnic background. We tend to talk about these fights in terms of religion, class and other markers, or simply as politics, without racial or ethnic qualifiers. Can Mitt Romney win over evangelicals? Blue-collar workers are feeling the pressures of wage stagnation! The widely understood subtext is that most of the folks in question are also white.\n\nThis election cycle, there's notably broad, public acknowledgement that the concerns and complaints of many white voters are all tied up with race and racially motivated unease. To understand how those National Review pieces grapple with white identity politics — whether they intended to or not — we first have to talk about how membership in the club of whiteness has functioned in American political life over time.\n\nAt any given moment in American history, the lives and rights of people who were theoretically American, but not white, centered on where their group could be plotted in relation to whiteness. That relationship could fluctuate over time.\n\nFor instance, European immigrants who settled in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries were often charged with indolence, moral degeneracy and criminality, and their arrivals flamed anxieties around how these groups might change the fundamental character of America. (Sound familiar?) But these sentiments waned over time, as these communities were absorbed into the broader galaxy of American whiteness and therefore granted entry into real Americanness.\n\nAt times, people of color have tried to argue for greater rights in ways that made that connection between whiteness and real Americanness more explicit, even technical. In the first decades of the 20th century, two different Supreme Court cases, brought just a few years apart by Asian-Americans — one with roots in India, the other with roots in Japan — rested on the plaintiffs' argument that they should be considered Caucasoid in accordance with the anthropological understanding at the time, and thus deserving of all the rights and civic protections of Americanness enjoyed by white America. (The high court ruled against them both.)\n\nThe conflation of Americanness with whiteness has also determined, at times, who is seen as deserving of help, and who isn't. To create support for the postwar New Deal programs that effectively created the white middle class — the GI Bill, Social Security, etc. — legislators baked in the ability to exclude black folks. At the very moment a wide array of public policies were providing most white Americans with valuable tools to gain protection in their old age, good jobs, economic security, assets and middle-class status, black Americans were mainly left to fend for themselves, writes Ira Katnelson, a political scientist at Columbia.\n\nThis is all to say, the tug of war over who gets to enjoy the benefits reserved for real Americans has always been all tied up with racial politics. People of color were overwhelmingly excluded during the glory days that so many white voters this election cycle look back on as better times. That's why Trump's Make America Great Again mantra reads so menacingly to so many — whiteness seems to be a necessary precondition for that nostalgia.\n\nWhich brings us back to the modern Republican Party, which has long positioned itself as the party of real America — a characterization with unavoidable racial shadings when nearly all Republicans are white people.\n\nA central goal of the mainstream conservative establishment (of which the National Review is a part) has been to stunt and roll back the size and influence of government, with the welfare state right in the crosshairs. But to the chagrin of the Republican brass, Trump's vocal support for some types of social safety nets that conservatives are supposed to disdain — claiming, for example, that he would replace Obamacare with a single-payer health care system — hasn't repulsed the downscale rank and file.\n\nInstead, Trump's ascendance has been fueled less by concern over slashing and destroying entitlements, broadly speaking, than by a desire to protect those entitlements for the right people. Mr. Trump is a political harbinger here of a new strand of populist Republicanism ... in which the 'conservative' position is to defend the existing entitlement programs from a perceived threat posed by a new-style Obama coalition of handout seekers that includes the chronically unemployed, students, immigrants, minorities and women, wrote the Wall Street Journal's Holman Jenkins.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis put it more bluntly: Government funds that end up in the hands of likely GOP voters (Medicare and Social Security) are considered earned benefits, but those that help likely Democratic voters (Medicaid, Obamacare, income supports) are slapped with the stigmatized welfare label.\n\nDavid Frum of the Atlantic, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, recently drew a connection to similar anxieties in Europe expressed by folks who staunchly defend the welfare state while expressing broad suspicion toward new claimants to it:\n\nThese populists seek to defend what the French call 'acquired rights' — health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people — against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. In the United States, they lean Republican because they fear the Democrats want to take from them and redistribute to Americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving — to 'spread the wealth around,' in candidate Barack Obama's words to 'Joe the Plumber' back in 2008. Yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart.\n\nYou might view the dust-up over the National Review pieces as conservatives fighting over where the line in the sand between real Americans and everybody else rightly belongs. The establishment view seems pretty clear: Those who reach for government handouts need not apply. But huge swaths of white, working-class Americans seem to see things differently this election cycle: Real Americans — like them — deserve help, and everyone else needs to shape up or ship out.\n\nJust like in the past, the current debate over who gets to be a real American is all tied up with bigger debates about race and immigration. What's so fascinating about the latest iteration of this fight is that many white conservatives — whether downscale or establishment — suddenly see their fellow real Americans standing on the wrong side of the line.
Man Tells Bernie Sanders He Will Kill Himself Because Of Medical Debt\n\nThe presidential candidate, in a Nevada campaign stop, pushed back on criticism of his Medicare for All plan. Instead of asking Sanders questions, people have vented about health insurance problems.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders took a lot of criticism from his fellow candidates in last week's presidential debate over his health care plan. So Sanders used a recent campaign trip to Nevada to defend his Medicare for All proposal. NPR's Scott Detrow was there. And just a quick note, this story has an exchange that some listeners might find disturbing.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: The day after the debate, Sanders was in Carson City. His voice was still hoarse. And he was clearly still thinking about the night before, when several other candidates criticized his plan to entirely do away with private health insurance.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: But I was not pleased that Vice President Biden distorted what Medicare for All is and, in fact, simply parroted the line coming from the health care industry.\n\nDETROW: Biden says building on Obamacare and creating an optional Medicare-type national plan is the better approach. But for Sanders, private companies and their profit motives are the root of the problem. He blasted the insurance industry in Nevada, along with the big pharmaceutical companies he blames for spreading opioid addiction.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSANDERS: Oh, somebody here says lock them up. No, we don't do that. They are rich and powerful. I'm sorry. Clearly, you do not understand the criminal justice system in America.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDETROW: Lately, Sanders has been turning rallies into town halls where, instead of asking him questions, people vent about their health insurance problems. In Carson City, a man named John Weigel told Sanders how his bills keep piling up to over $100,000. And this exchange may be disturbing for some listeners.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN WEIGEL: I can barely take care of myself. And I do not have the energy to fight these people...\n\nDETROW: Weigel was angry and desperate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSANDERS: How are you going to pay off a hundred...\n\nWEIGEL: I can't. I can't. I'm going to kill myself...\n\nSANDERS: Hold it, John. Stop it. You're not going to kill yourself. All right. Stop it...\n\nWEIGEL: I can't deal with this. I have Huntington's disease.\n\nDETROW: Sanders and his wife, Jane, spoke with Weigel after the event. And Sanders supporters have since set up an online fundraising effort to help him with those bills. After Carson City, it was on to Reno in Las Vegas. Nevada is the third state up in the presidential contest. That's due largely to the influence of one man, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid's retired now and battling cancer. But he's still paying close attention, and he's still in touch with the 2020 candidates. So I drove to his house in the Las Vegas suburbs.\n\nFifteen. We're looking for 17.\n\nReid was wearing a straw fedora sitting in his sunny living room.\n\nHARRY REID: It's my house. I can put my hat on if I want, right?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDETROW: Nevada's often the overlooked early state. It isn't in the national campaign narratives much.\n\nREID: People go to New Hampshire. It's easy. Iowa's easy. South Carolina's easy. Coming to Nevada's harder. But they're making a mistake not coming here more often.\n\nDETROW: Reid points out Nevada is the first early state with a significant minority population. Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up a big chunk of caucus goers.\n\nREID: We're a state that looks like the rest of the country, and you don't have that other places.\n\nDETROW: Several of the campaigns say immigration, climate change and affordable housing are key issues in Nevada. In Las Vegas, Sanders rolled out a $2.5 trillion plan to expand affordable housing and address homelessness.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSANDERS: If you're spending 50% of your limited incomes on housing, how do you pay for food? How do you pay for transportation?\n\nDETROW: In a crowded primary field, Sanders is relying on the electorate buying into the policies he's embraced for decades. Still, here and there, he's showing some adaptation to modern campaigning.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSANDERS: What I'd like to do now, if it's OK with you - if anybody would like to come up and do a selfie, we'd love to do it. Anybody want to do that?\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDETROW: Scott Detrow, NPR News, Carson City, Nev.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GEORGIA ANNE MULDROW'S BASS ATTACK BAP)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

In House Majority Leader's Home District, Many Depend On Health Law He Wants To Scrap\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act first and replace it sometime later. That doesn't sit well with Victoria Barton, who lives in McCarthy's rural California district.\n\nIt's like they dangled the carrot and now they're taking it away, said Barton, 38, of Bakersfield, an unpaid photographer and stay-at-home mother of two.\n\nBarton and her husband, a contract computer technician, had been uninsured for most of their adult lives. When Obamacare expanded Medicaid, they were finally able to qualify for the low-income health program. This year, California's version of Medicaid, known as Medi-Cal, paid for surgery to remedy Barton's long-standing carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nWhen McCarthy returns later this month to his congressional district, a mostly agricultural region in California's Central Valley including the city of Bakersfield and Edwards Air Force Base, he is likely to face quite a few confused and frustrated constituents.\n\nTwo counties represented by the Republican leader are among the most heavily dependent on Medi-Cal in the state. Roughly half of the residents are covered by Medi-Cal, which added about 212,000 enrollees after Obamacare took effect.\n\nNearly 29,000 residents have purchased health plans through Covered California, the state's insurance exchange, with coverage heavily subsidized by the federal government.\n\nSome of those who favor the law, or rely on it, see a conflict between McCarthy's stated goals as a national leader and the needs of so many of his constituents.\n\nThose comments he made [about repeal] just demonstrate how disconnected he is from the people he's supposed to be representing, said Edgar Aguilar, program manager for Community Health Initiative of Kern County, an organization that helps enroll residents in Medi-Cal and Covered California in Bakersfield.\n\nMcCarthy's staff in Washington, D.C., said there wasn't anyone available to comment.\n\nThe complexities of repealing Obamacare are laid bare in the 23rd Congressional District that McCarthy represents, highlighting what other Republican politicians from less affluent areas may face.\n\nOn one hand, the district is considered a safe Republican haven. McCarthy easily defeated his Democratic challenger in November, winning about 70 percent of the vote. More than half of voters in Kern and Tulare counties chose President-elect Donald Trump. Some of McCarthy's constituents vocally support his promise to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nOn the other hand, constituents like Barton worry about the consequences of repealing the health law without an immediate replacement. They fear losing all or part of their health coverage, or losing jobs in the health care industry.\n\nUnemployment in Kern and Tulare counties runs between 9 percent and nearly 11 percent, twice as high as the state average. About a quarter of residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nWith Obamacare, we've made this gigantic step ... and then suddenly to just take it away without any rational plan in place seems totally irresponsible, says Bill Phelps, chief of program services at Clinica Sierra Vista, a network of health care clinics serving 200,000 patients. They're playing chess with the American population.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, the health care network where Phelps works has hired more than 100 employees and opened at least four new health centers, although some clinics were planned beforehand.\n\nA repeal of the Medi-Cal expansion may require the clinic system to shed some nursing and case management jobs, clinic officials said.\n\nHealth care is such an integral part of the economy, said Phelps, adding that he hopes McCarthy will look into the details before scrapping Obamacare. You just can't turn off the switch.\n\nBut McCarthy seems to want a quick repeal. He told reporters that ending the Affordable Care Act is easier and faster than passing an alternative policy, which would require more votes.\n\nI want to make sure it gets done right, he said of replacing Obamacare in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nStill, some in McCarthy's district will be glad to see Obamacare go, and as soon as possible. This whole system has been a disaster from Day 1, said Rodger Harmel, an insurance agent in Bakersfield. Rates have been at an all-time high.\n\nHarmel says most of his Covered California clients earn too much to qualify for the federal subsidies that reduce monthly premiums. He said most are paying more now than they did before the law and didn't need the new rules to be able to buy insurance. A forced coverage system is not the answer, he said.\n\nBut health care advocates in Sacramento have sharply criticized McCarthy's remarks, saying his plan could create chaos in California's individual insurance market.\n\nThe elimination of financial help in Covered California — even if delayed — would not just cause people to drop coverage and insurers to leave the market, but would force skyrocketing rates for those left in a smaller and sicker insurance pool, said Anthony Wright of Health Access California, a statewide consumer advocacy coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, Aguilar, the program manager for Community Health Initiative of Kern County, said roughly six people are referred to his organization each month by a local cancer center. They have been diagnosed with cancer or another serious illness but don't have insurance, he said.\n\nFor people like this, a full repeal of Obamacare without a replacement would be devastating, Aguilar said.\n\nIt's just horrible thinking about those people who are having the worst experience in their life and now they're not going to have anywhere to turn in order to get the coverage they need to get their medical care, Aguilar said.\n\nI'm afraid people can lose their lives without the coverage they need, he added.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the Tate family/KHN Courtesy of the Tate family/KHN\n\nWorry about Obamacare's repeal is not confined to residents who depend on the government for coverage.\n\nBakersfield resident David Tate, a 34-year-old school nurse, has a son, Lucas, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2009, when he was 7 months old. The boy survived after intensive chemotherapy treatments.\n\nTate, who then had a private market plan to cover Lucas, credited two provisions of the Affordable Care Act for giving his family security and peace of mind after Lucas' initial treatment was over. One was a requirement to cover people with pre-existing conditions. If the ACA hadn't been there and I needed another private plan, they would have denied him coverage, Tate said.\n\nThe second provision prohibited insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on most benefits in most plans.\n\nLucas had essentially used his lifetime maximum for treatments in that first year, Tate said. Could you imagine if Lucas had relapsed? We would have been completely out of benefits. We would have just been hosed.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.
Doctors Unsure About How To Talk With Patients About End-Of-Life Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Edwards/Getty Images/Caiaimage Sam Edwards/Getty Images/Caiaimage\n\nDoctors know it's important to talk with their patients about end-of-life care.\n\nBut they're finding it tough to start those conversations. When they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released Thursday.\n\nSuch discussions are becoming more important as baby boomers reach their golden years. By 2030, an estimated 72 million Americans will be 65 or over, nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population.\n\nMedicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. Known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.\n\nPayment for such discussions was initially included in the Affordable Care Act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. Medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of Obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.\n\nThe poll of 736 primary care doctors and specialists, including 202 in California, examined their views on advance care planning and end-of-life conversations with patients. Among the findings:\n\nWhile 75 percent of doctors said Medicare reimbursement makes it more likely they'd have advance care planning discussions, only about 14 percent said they had actually billed Medicare for those visits.\n\nThree quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.\n\nFewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.\n\nMore than half said they had not discussed end-of-life care with their own physicians.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by The John A. Hartford Foundation, the California Health Care Foundation and Cambia Health Foundation. (California Healthline is an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.)\n\nThe general survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. For the internist/primary care provider sample, margin is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. For specialists, plus or minus 6.0 points.\n\nPatients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. Most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.\n\nPolicy analysts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.\n\nA recent study found nearly 40 percent of American patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. An average of about $18,500 was spent on U.S. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.\n\nNearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they're required to use don't have a place to include patients' end-of-life preferences. Even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn't access its actual contents.\n\nAnd doctors who received their medical training years ago say they rarely focused on how to talk to patients about end-of-life care, although medical education is improving in that regard.\n\nPhysicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. At Kaiser Permanente in Northern California, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said Dr. Ruma Kumar, the HMO's regional medical director of supportive care services.\n\nKaiser Permanente looks to nurse practitioners, registered nurses and social workers to work with patients on various stages of what the HMO calls life care planning. The HMO also offers a website to guide people through the process.\n\nKumar said Kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.

Shopping For Obamacare Opens To Mixed Reviews From Consumers\n\ntoggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has her work cut out for her.\n\nShe has to convince millions of people who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges or who have no coverage at all that they should go online and shop for a good deal.\n\nIt's a big challenge because Tuesday is the first day of open enrollment for Obamacare health insurance, and it comes just a week after HHS announced that the prices of policies sold on the exchanges would rise an average 22 percent for 2017.\n\nWhat's her biggest challenge? Helping people focus on what the consumer pays because that's the most important thing, Burwell said in an interview with NPR on Oct. 26, and that's what consumers actually care about.\n\nBut it's not always easy to figure out what the consumer pays. That's because the approximately 10 million people who buy policies through the Affordable Care Act can qualify for discounts on premiums and out of pocket expenses based on income.\n\nEighty-five percent of those folks actually receive tax credits or subsidies and for them that insulates them from these changes, she said.\n\nThat's what's happening to Darvin Bentlage, a farmer in southwest Missouri, outside the town of Lamar. Like many farmers, he has been having a rough time recently. He raises corn, soybeans and beef, and prices for all his products have plummeted in the past two years.\n\nIn late October he was pretty upset because he got a letter from his insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, saying his policy was going up about $200 a month. Even after his subsidy, he thought he'd be paying $500 a month just for his premium. On top of that he spends about $300 a month on medications to control his diabetes.\n\nSo I'm going to be paying close to $10,000 on my medicine and my insurance on a $20,000 income, he said.\n\nBut Bentlage, 60, hadn't yet logged on to HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace, to shop for a plan. He did that over the weekend and afterward, he was much happier.\n\nHis tax credit more than doubled to $664 a month, and he found a policy that would cost him, after that subsidy, about $150 a month. And his deductible was lower, too.\n\nSo that was a pleasant surprise, you know, he said on Monday.\n\nBentlage said he's glad he doesn't have to go without insurance like he did before the Affordable Care Act. At that time he couldn't find coverage because of his diabetes.\n\nHe paid his own medical bills and had to refinance his 1,200 acre farm to pay for two colon surgeries.\n\nSo from my view here, the ACA was a good thing to get people with pre-existing conditions health insurance, he said.\n\nIf Bentlage is the story Sylvia Burwell wants to hear, Will Denecke is her nightmare.\n\nDenecke, 63, is a self-employed urban planning consultant in Portland, Ore. He makes too much money to quality for financial assistance.\n\nHe's also pretty healthy and doesn't use much medical care. But his premiums have almost tripled in the past three years. To him it's just too much.\n\nI am not willing to pay $930 for coverage and to pay a $3,000 deductible, he said. So he's going to shop around on HealthCare.gov for a better deal. But if he doesn't find one, he said he may skip buying insurance and hope for the best.\n\nI'm going to hope that if I have a health issue, I can go back during the year, not during open enrollment and go onto the marketplace and buy insurance, he said.\n\nThe purpose of having a limited open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act is to ensure that people don't only buy health insurance when they get sick, and then drop it when they're healthy. That would make insurance even more expensive.\n\nThe ACA allows people to buy a policy outside of open enrollment if they've had a big change in life — maybe they got married, or they lost their job.\n\nBut Denecke said those rules are easy to get around. He knows from experience.\n\nI've done it before, he said. And my broker helped me. And the great thing was we got an answer within two minutes.\n\nHe said that as a consultant he was able to claim a change in income that allowed him to buy insurance midyear a couple of years ago, when he got some bad results on a prostate screening.\n\nI know that that undermines the economics and the premise of the ACA, he said. You don't buy car insurance after you have an accident. You buy before it.\n\nInsurers have complained to Burwell that the so-called special enrollment periods are too liberal, and HHS has been working to tighten up the rules. Denecke knows this, but may take his chances anyway.\n\nBut he, like many people, said the policies are just too expensive otherwise.\n\nBurwell would like to see some changes to the law that might help lower premiums for consumers and health costs overall.\n\nShe said lawmakers should consider increasing subsidies so the policies are even cheaper on a monthly basis, and she'd like for HHS to be allowed to negotiate lower drug prices, which could lower the cost of health insurance in the long run.\n\nAnd, she said, policymakers should reconsider allowing the government to offer health insurance in markets where there's little competition.\n\nAfter three insurance companies pulled out of several ACA markets and premiums rose, analysts say this enrollment period will be crucial to ensure that enough people like Will Denecke buy policies to ensure the system remains stable.\n\nBurwell agrees. Is it an important year to make sure that we're getting more folks in and to make that risk pool better? Yes, she said.\n\nBut Burwell said changes mandated by the ACA — such as the ban on rejecting people who have pre-existing conditions — are now so integrated into the health care system that they aren't going away.\n\nThis is health care in the United States now, she said. And so what we need to do now is make sure we're working to make this system and these changes work the best they can.
Coronavirus Reset: How To Get Health Insurance Now\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nIf there's a time that people particularly need access to good health care and health insurance, it's during a global pandemic.\n\nBut in the U.S. 33.5 million people so far have had to file for unemployment benefits — and most people in the nation get their health insurance through their jobs. An analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday estimates that 27 million people have recently lost their health coverage.\n\nThe bit of good news is that the report also found that the vast majority of those who lost their insurance can remain covered by switching to a spouse's plan, or are eligible to get subsidized health insurance elsewhere — either via Medicaid or via a plan on the Obamacare insurance exchanges.\n\nTo me that the takeaway from this report is that the Affordable Care Act is serving as the safety net it was intended to be, says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Of course, the ultimate irony is it's performing this function at a time when the Trump administration is arguing before the Supreme Court that it should be struck down.\n\nThe question now is how many people who have lost their coverage will actually enroll in a new plan. Health insurance is complicated, and signing up can be hard. There are a lot of stressors on people right now, says Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation and an author of the report. You may be unemployed, you might be sick, you might be quarantining — and there's just a limit to how many life things you can deal with at once.\n\nStill, the clock is ticking. If you've lost coverage because of a job loss, that's what's called a qualifying life event. You can go to Healthcare.Gov or your state's insurance exchange right now to enroll in a new plan.\n\nBut that needs to happen within 60 days of losing coverage — and especially for people who lost their employer-based insurance in early March, there's no time to lose. Here is a guide to a few of the options available to you if you're one of the millions who've recently lost your job and your health insurance:\n\nI got laid off and had insurance through my job\n\nYou might be able to keep the same health plan under federal rules known as COBRA — if you worked for an employer with 20 employees or more. Levitt says one advantage of COBRA is it provides the most continuity of coverage, because you stay in exactly the same plan you were in when you were employed — same network of doctors and hospitals, same deductible — everything is identical. But this continuation of your current health coverage can be quite expensive because, at least under normal circumstances, you would have to pay the full monthly premium, without your employer chipping in to make it more affordable. Your insurer is required to notify you if you have the COBRA option, and you have 60 days to elect to take it. (For those who lost coverage in March, the clock is ticking to elect this option).\n\nThe next place to look is the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act. Losing health insurance that you got through your job is considered a qualifying event to enroll in a plan on all the health insurance exchanges. That means you can go to Healthcare.gov or your state-run exchange and shop for a new plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy subsidy calculator so you can see what you might pay in premiums for these plans — remember that your unemployment benefits count as income on the exchanges. Again, you only have 60 days to choose this option after losing coverage (unless you live in a state that's created a special enrollment period), so be sure and enroll in that time window.\n\nIf your income has been wiped out with the lost job, you should also check to see whether you qualify for Medicaid, the national health insurance program for low-income people that's jointly funded by federal and state governments. Medicaid enrollment takes place year-round and is based on monthly income, not annual income, and it's essentially free for people who are eligible. You're more likely to qualify if you live in one of the 37 states and D.C. that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI was already uninsured\n\nYour options to get covered if you're one of roughly 28 million Americans who were uninsured even before the COVID-19 crisis depend on where you live. Medicaid may work for you, but the rules for eligibility (including the income cut-off) vary by state. States that have not expanded Medicaid — which is how Obamacare broadened coverage to 12 million previously uninsured people — have more restrictive rules about who qualifies. According to the Kaiser foundation, nearly 6 million adults already qualified for Medicaid before COVID-19 but were not enrolled.\n\nIf you don't qualify for Medicaid, next look to the state insurance exchanges that were set up under the ACA. The Trump administration has decided not to open a special enrollment period for Healthcare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. But some states run their own insurance marketplaces and have created a special enrollment period during the coronavirus crisis. In these states — including hard-hit places like California and New York — that means you don't need to have a qualifying event like job-based coverage loss or the birth of a child to newly enroll right now in an Obamacare plan.\n\nIt's worth checking to see whether you can enroll and get an affordable plan — according to KFF, more than 4 million people who were uninsured before the coronavirus crisis would have qualified for a subsidized ACA health plan that would cost them nothing in monthly insurance premiums.\n\nOne thing to note is that Congress has put funding in some of its emergency funding bills that may help hospitals and health systems pay for COVID-19 care for the uninsured. While people who are uninsured might still receive bills from providers, [these federal funds] will help reduce the burden on patients because the hospitals will be compensated at least partially for their costs, says Corlette of Georgetown University.\n\nWhite House officials have pointed to this funding as a reason why a federal special enrollment period may not be necessary. Uninsured patients' bills related to COVID-19 might be forgiven by doctors and hospitals, the White House suggests. Many details about how that federal funding will be dispersed are still up in the air, and it's limited to care and testing related to the coronavirus.\n\nWhile COVID-19 is a very present risk right now in a lot of people's minds, people have health care needs that go beyond the coronavirus. notes Levitt. If you end up with cancer, for instance, or a burst appendix and you're uninsured, that could be financially ruinous, which is why health policy experts always recommend getting covered if you can.\n\nMy kids have lost their coverage, too\n\nThere will be many people — more than 5 million — who won't have access to insurance they can afford, even with the options mentioned above. If you can't get a health plan for the adults in your family, your children might still be able to get coverage — the rules are different for them, as well as for pregnant women. InsureKidsNow.gov is a good place to start to determine if your children may be eligible.\n\nWhat about short-term or skinny plans?\n\nShort-term health insurance plans were originally designed to be used for just several months — to tide people over between the end of schooling and the start of a new job, for instance. Since then, the Trump administration has promoted these plans, and their more affordable monthly premiums, as good long-term alternatives.\n\nBut the plans often have more limitations in what they cover than ACA plans do. They're allowed to restrict enrollment to those without preexisting conditions, for example, and don't have to cover all essential benefits included in all Obamacare plans. They might exclude prescription drugs; they might cap how much they'll pay in a hospital, says Levitt. So if you look at one of these short-term plans, you really want to read the fine print carefully.\n\nOnce I'm insured, what's covered in the time of coronavirus?\n\nCongress has required that the cost of coronavirus testing be covered by insurers (though testing is still not always available). What's less clear is how much your treatment will cost you if you get seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for COVID-19.\n\nHospital and emergency care are considered essential benefits and must be covered, but patients may still have to meet the annual deductible of their policy and pay things like copays and coinsurance on top of that. Some large commercial insurers have pledged to waive these patient costs for COVID-19 treatment, and several nonprofit community health plans have as well. The limited availability of diagnostic testing may make it tricky to prove you qualify for these benefits, Levitt points out.\n\nUnfortunately, surprise bills are still a concern — those are bills that come directly from out-of-network hospitals or doctors who provide your care. Nearly 1 in 5 inpatient admissions for pneumonia results in a surprise bill, according to a KFF analysis. It's possible members of Congress will try to address this in future coronavirus legislation, but until they do, this will remain a way that people could be exposed to high medical bills.\n\nIf you do get a surprise bill from COVID-19 treatment, the same advice applies as always (this will be familiar to those who follow NPR's Bill of the Month series): Call your hospital or doctor and/or insurance company, and try to negotiate a lower bill. If they won't budge, check with the doctor or hospital to see if they can help you with a payment plan, or forgive the debt, as a part of a charity care program.\n\nThe original version of this updated story published on April 3, 2020.
Senate Health Care Bill Revisions Released In Attempt To Appease GOP Critics\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nUpdated 6:56 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Republicans on Thursday released a revised version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe new version comes after the Congressional Budget Office found that the original BCRA would in the next decade increase the uninsured population by 22 million over what it would otherwise be. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped for a vote before July 4, but was forced to delay that because he couldn't garner the 50 votes he needed among the 52 GOP senators.\n\nThe question now is whether this version of the bill could pass the Senate. Shortly after its release, Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul both said they intend to vote against letting the bill go forward. With two no votes, Vice President Pence could provide the 51st vote needed for passage. But if three Republican senators defect, the bill cannot pass.\n\nThe new bill makes some big changes from the last BCRA draft, but it also leaves some major parts of the original Senate proposal intact — it would still repeal the individual and employer mandates, it would still mean cuts to Medicaid spending, and it would still allow states to opt out of key parts of Obamacare.\n\nIn their summary of the bill, Senate Republicans laid out the major provisions. Here are some of those big changes that this new version of the bill would make to the original BCRA, and what they would mean:\n\nHealth savings accounts will be able to pay for premiums. Under IRS rules, people with high-deductible plans are eligible for health savings accounts (HSAs), accounts into which people can put money for health care expenses tax-free. Under this bill, people would for the first time be able to use that money for premiums. Americans' deposits in HSAs have ballooned over the last decade, according to HSA consulting firm Devenir. However, those accounts also tend to benefit higher-income people more than others, as Kaiser Health News' Michelle Andrews wrote in December — for example, richer people are more likely to have the extra money to sock away for health expenses.\n\nMore money for the opioid epidemic. The Senate's initial bill offered $2 billion to address the opioid crisis for 2018. This version would offer about $45 billion over 10 years, which is what Republicans Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito had requested at one point. However, some experts say that around $4.5 billion a year is nowhere near enough for combating America's massive opioid epidemic, as the New York Times reported in June.\n\nKeeping some Obamacare taxes. The first BCRA version would have repealed an array of Affordable Care Act taxes, which would have overwhelmingly benefited higher-income Americans. This newer version of the bill keeps some in place, including the net investment income tax and a payroll tax that hit higher-income Americans.\n\nAllowing insurers to offer non-Obamacare-qualified plans. This mirrors an idea that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee had proposed in recent weeks: The Senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. As long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of Obamacare's Title I (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.\n\nThat idea had created worries of a two-tiered insurance system — one in which older and sicker people would opt into the more comprehensive plans, while younger and healthier people would choose the cheaper plans that covered less, potentially causing a death spiral on the exchanges for those older and sicker people.\n\nExtra stabilization money, in part for high-risk customers. The original version of the BCRA provided $112 billion that would have allowed states to stabilize their markets or help high-risk customers in a wide variety of ways. In this version, that is bumped up to $182 billion. One function of this money is to mitigate some of the two-tier issues created by new, nonqualified plans. If an insurer offers a plan that meets the Obamacare criteria, that insurer would be eligible for money to help high-risk customers.\n\nThis all means that the new version doesn't make major changes to one big part of the BCRA: Medicaid. Under the original Senate bill, the Obamacare Medicaid expansion would be rolled back, and Medicaid spending would be capped — states would either be allotted a certain amount per capita, or they could get a block grant instead. It also caps Medicaid spending growth in the medium-to-long-term. This bill doesn't change any of that.\n\nAccording to the CBO, the original BCRA would have cut Medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years, and would have resulted in 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than under current law.\n\nA new CBO score on the bill is expected Monday or Tuesday. By the end of next week, there is likely to be a key procedural vote. That would put things on track for a final vote the following week.\n\nWere this bill to pass the Senate, it would then have to be reconciled with the House's attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, known as the American Health Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina released an alternative plan Thursday morning.\n\nA summary of the bill is embedded below. You can read the full draft here, and see the previous Senate version here.\n\nWashington Desk editor Arnie Seipel contributed to this report.\n\nThis report has been updated to reflect that the extra $70 billion for stabilization funding will be in part used for helping insurers defray the costs of high-risk individuals.
The South's Handling Of Coronavirus Could Be 'A Macabre Game Of Whack-A-Mole'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kim Chandler/AP Kim Chandler/AP\n\nSome Southern states, including Georgia and South Carolina, are among the first in the country to ease restrictions to try get back to business despite factors that make the South particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAnd pressure is mounting on other Southern governors to get their economies back up and running. Outside the Alabama Capitol this week, a few dozen protesters drove by honking their horns, chanting freedom and demanding to get back to work\n\nRepublican Gov. Kay Ivey has issued a stay-at-home order through April 30. Paralegal Melissa Kirby from Athens, Ala., says she has had enough.\n\nNational There's Disagreement Over Whether States Are Ready To Reopen There's Disagreement Over Whether States Are Ready To Reopen Listen · 3:44 3:44\n\nIf she was worried about safety, she could let the people who are actually in danger self-quarantine, wash their hands more, Kirby says. But to force businesses to shut down, that's not her call.\n\nFrom inside the Capitol, Ivey says that no one wants to open the economy more than she does, but that the state must first increase its testing capacity.\n\nRemember all of our decisions that I'm going to make are based on data, not desired date, Ivey says.\n\nShe is taking a more cautious approach than are neighboring states Georgia, Tennessee, Florida and Mississippi, where Republican governors have all moved to reopen at least parts of their economies.\n\nI think that we could be heading for a macabre game of whack-a-mole, says Thomas LaVeist, dean of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans. He worries that Louisiana — an early hot spot for COVID-19 — could see a resurgence in cases as surrounding states ease restrictions.\n\nUnless the states in the South can coordinate the way the states in the North, East, the West, and the upper Midwest are striving to do, we're going to have problems, he says.\n\nLaVeist says longstanding policy decisions, and population characteristics in the South already put the region at risk in a health pandemic. He points to high poverty rates, large numbers of uninsured residents, lower minimum wages, and general health and well-being measures.\n\nThe South is the epicenter for health inequities in this country, LaVeist says. We call the South the stroke belt — higher rates of all kind of chronic conditions.\n\nConditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and kidney disease have all been identified as factors in COVID-19 deaths.\n\nLaVeist says rural communities in the South are not really resourced to manage an outbreak given the number of rural hospitals that have closed or downsized in recent years.\n\nYou add all of that together and you've got sort of this toxic mix of political decisions, policy decisions, resource limitations that just create an opportunity for a pandemic to really just rage in the South, LaVeist says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nAnother disturbing trend is the high proportion of coronavirus cases and deaths among African-Americans.\n\nThe early evidence of that is from Louisiana, where the death toll has now surpassed that of Hurricane Katrina. African-Americans make up 56% of reported COVID deaths, but just about one-third of the state's population. Other Southern states show similar disproportionate impacts on African-American residents.\n\nIn New Orleans, there are clusters of cases in predominantly black neighborhoods where people mostly work in the tourism industry.\n\nThis virus has exposed the social and economic fragility of working families, says New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.\n\nShe points to a tyranny of policies that leaves families without a living wage or access to health care.\n\nAll of this is embedded in really what we're seeing across the board in the city of New Orleans, Cantrell says. And really the state of Louisiana is on the front line as it relates to these matters\n\nSouthern states are also subject to natural disasters. This month, there have been deadly tornadoes and flash floods; hurricane season starts June 1; and there's spring flooding on the Mississippi River.\n\nPlanet Money COVID-19 Pandemic Puts Rural Hospitals Under Even More Pressure COVID-19 Pandemic Puts Rural Hospitals Under Even More Pressure Listen · 3:22 3:22\n\nIn the river town of Greenville, Miss., Mayor Errick Simmons says they're still reeling from record floods last year with some residents still displaced.\n\nIn a city that has a 38.6% poverty rate, this COVID-19 is exacerbating all of the issues that we're having, Simmons says. The acute nature of the pandemic's economic downturn is felt more here than many other places.\n\nSimmons says demand at food pantries and soup kitchens has nearly tripled in the Mississippi Delta.\n\nRegionwide, eight of the 10 states with the biggest jumps in unemployment claims are in the South.\n\nThe pandemic is also renewing calls for expanding Medicaid coverage. Nine of the 14 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are in the South. Of them, Texas has the highest number of uninsured residents.\n\nRep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, fears those numbers are on the rise based on calls to his office from constituents who have lost their jobs and their health insurance.\n\nSo now, more than ever, we need to push to expand Medicaid, he says. To provide a backstop to our health care coverage for many working people who desperately need it.\n\nAllred, whose congressional district includes the Dallas area, is pushing legislation that would offer more federal money to states that expand Medicaid, in an effort to sway mostly Republican legislatures and governors to reconsider their repeated rejection of a key part of Obamacare.\n\nSen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., is behind the bill. He says expanding Medicaid would help protect everyone in these uncertain times.\n\nThe thing that this pandemic has really brought home to people is that our health is dependent on our neighbors health more than we like to have thought about in the past, Jones says.\n\nA test of that dependency is coming with some Southern states now on the brink of reopening.
Week In Politics: Midterms, Suspicious Packages And The Migrant Caravan\n\nNPR's Audie Cornish speaks with E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times, about midterms, the migrant caravan and the suspicious packages.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNow, to dig into this more and the politics of the week, I want to bring in E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Hey there, E.J.\n\nE J DIONNE, BYLINE: Good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: And David Brooks of The New York Times, welcome back.\n\nDAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Thank you.\n\nCORNISH: So President Trump's response to this story has been varied, to say the least. In the last few hours, speaking about the arrest, as we heard, he had this to say.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We must never allow political violence to take root in America - cannot let it happen. And I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it.\n\nCORNISH: Yesterday morning, he tweeted, quote, a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it's beyond description. David, can you talk about - help us understand how the leader of our country is leading us through this moment.\n\nBROOKS: Well, he could have been worse in the last couple days.\n\nDIONNE: (Laughter).\n\nBROOKS: But it follows three years where he's basically destroyed every norm of common civility and the rules by which we used to do our politics. And so we've entered a world where a lot of people apparently treat politics as a cult, as, like, the most important form of identity, which is asking more of politics than it can bear, and then who think politics is a war to the death between two opposing sides, which is also not true. Politics is a competition between two sides with partial truths. And so we've got this catastrophizing view of politics which filters down to disturbed people.\n\nCORNISH: E.J., I want to talk to you about this as well. Obviously we do not know right now the motivations of this suspect. But because people are talking about who received these packages, how are you thinking about how this episode has had people talking about divisions in the country?\n\nDIONNE: Well, first of all, good for law enforcement for finding Mr. Sayoc so quickly. It shows what's happening on the right side of politics that there were already people saying, oh, this is a false flag operation by liberals. And whatever else we know about Mr. Sayoc, his van is plastered with pro-Trump and anti-liberal messages. As Ryan said, his Twitter feed suggests he's on the Trump side if he's on any side at all.\n\nBut where I disagree with David - I think he's trying to generalize it too much in saying, oh, this is all politics. There's a fundamental problem here, which is that President Trump's hold on power depends on dividing the nation. It's not just that he's incapable of being a uniter. It's that unity is a dire threat to his political standing. And, you know, at 3:14 this morning, he tweeted an attack on CNN. And then later he sent out a tweet that - complaining that this bomb stuff - that's his phrase - was hurting the Republicans in the election. There's something very specific here about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support President Trump - is incapable of talking out against him.\n\nCORNISH: David, do you want to answer that? I know parsing through the Twitter feed can take up some time, but - OK. I want to move on to something else then. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. And this is as this caravan of some thousand migrants is traveling north through Mexico. The response to this is clearly political right now because no legislation is being passed, right? There's no other kind of movement. David what do you see in how we are talking about immigrants, migrants and asylum-seekers right now? Is this a permanent shift?\n\nBROOKS: I do think it is a permanent shift. If you ask working-class Americans why their incomes have stagnated, the two answers they give are immigration and trade. And so a lot more people have come to see immigration not only as a cultural shift but as an economic threat as well.\n\nI think what strikes me about this particular episode is that - again, the catastrophic tones people are using about it. We've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April. Some come ashore. Some get granted asylum - about 22 percent in this last wave. And we're a big country, and we can handle a lot of people. And the idea that this is some existential threat seems to me completely overblown. It's an issue that we can deal with. But the way it's being portrayed as some out-of-control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually happening.\n\nCORNISH: E.J., going into midterms, what is the Democratic reply to a Republican platform that talks about these issues so stridently?\n\nDIONNE: Well, I think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focused on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration helps to mobilize his base - the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for. They are constantly accused of being for open borders. And when you look at all of the immigration bills they've voted for, they call for - and with support, I should say, back in the day from some Republicans - they all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and tougher border enforcements.\n\nCORNISH: But that's hard to sort of frame in 10 days, right? I mean, this is...\n\nDIONNE: Well, right, but they - the - I think what they are doing - what they have to do is say, we're not for open borders, and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics, to health care and to the issues that a lot of voters are voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead - that's a terrible word - about where they stand on health care. And I think they are doing that quite effectively in a lot of local races, governors' races and I think in a great many House races, too.\n\nCORNISH: David, the Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care. How are you thinking about that?\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, I think it's an incredibly stupid idea. Donald Trump - he's - represents a big change in American foreign policy, a big change in American identity. He plays on cultural and identity issues. It's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been. And what strikes me is the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique. They go to health care. They say, you know, Obamacare gives you protection for insurance for pre-existing conditions, and we want to preserve that.\n\nSo while Trump makes a very comprehensive, mostly cultural and identity critique, the Democrats come back with a materialist response, which is, we're going to protect your benefits. And that's a decent response in normal times, but in times like this, I think the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism, in defense of diversity, a big argument against what Trump really stands for.\n\nCORNISH: E.J., last hard minute to you.\n\nDIONNE: I think that the voters disagree with David, that the - if you look at all of the polling, the top - of the top three issues, health care and economics rank one, two or two, one in where - where the voters come from. I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize. And I think national unity does not come simply from defending pluralism, which, by the way, Democrats do.\n\nI wrote recently about a lot of Democrats and a few Republicans defending being open, for example, to refugees in a way the Trump administration is not. But the way we come together is to solve problems. That's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was this week, and it seems to be working pretty well for her.\n\nCORNISH: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution. Thank you so much.\n\nDIONNE: Good to be with you.\n\nCORNISH: David Brooks of The New York Times, have a good weekend.\n\nBROOKS: Thank you. I will.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

How A President Trump Could Derail Obamacare By Dropping Legal Appeal\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by President Obama.\n\nBut the election of Donald Trump as president means Republican lawmakers wouldn't even have to pass repeal legislation to stop the health law from functioning. Instead, President Trump could do much of it with a stroke of a pen.\n\nTrump absolutely, through executive action, could have tremendous interference to the point of literally stopping a train on its tracks, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of law and health policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump is set to take office at a tricky time for the health law, with many Americans in both parties complaining about rising premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. The Republican-led Congress has refused to make changes to the law that would help it work better — such as offering a fix when insurers cancelled policies that individuals thought they would be able to keep. As staunch opponents of the law, they, of course, have little incentive to improve it.\n\nWhen problems have arisen, Obama has often used his executive authority to try to solve them. And it's this very mechanism Trump could use to undermine the law. As president, the Republican can just reverse Obama's actions in many cases, said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan who writes about health policy. A president can't undo the basic architecture of the law, but you can throw sand into the gears, he said.\n\nFormal regulations would take time to undo, because they must follow a lengthy process allowing for public comment. But there are several measures Trump could take on Day One of his presidency to cripple the law's effectiveness.\n\nPerhaps Trump's easiest action — and the one that would produce the largest impact — would be to drop the administration's appeal of a lawsuit filed by Republican House members in 2014. That suit, House v. Burwell, charged that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that Congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders — those earning between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nMore than half of people who purchase insurance in the health exchanges get the additional help, which reduces out-of-pocket health spending on deductibles and coinsurance. While that help for consumers is required under the law, the funding was not specifically included. (Tax credits for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level to help defray the cost of premiums are a separate program and were permanently funded in the ACA.)\n\nIn April, Federal District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in favor of the House Republicans. Such an appropriation cannot be inferred, she wrote of the payments, and insurer reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the Constitution. However, Collyer declined to enforce her decision, pending an appeal to a higher court. That appeal was filed in July and is still months away from resolution.\n\nIf Trump wanted to seriously damage the ACA, he could simply order the appeal dropped, letting the lower court ruling stand, and stop reimbursing insurers who are giving deep discounts to half their customers. That move would wreak havoc, said Michael Cannon of the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime opponent of the health law. The insurers would still have to provide the discounts, as required by law, he said, but they're no longer getting subsidies from the federal government to cover the cost. So they are going to be selling insurance to these people way below the cost of that coverage.\n\nEven those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. A Trump administration really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing payments to insurers, said Rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. There is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including Aetna and United HealthCare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017.\n\nAnother way Trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. That requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. But executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward, Bagley said. If healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance.\n\nAside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their Medicaid programs. States rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their Medicaid programs operating. There are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do, Rosenbaum said.\n\nThe bigger question, though, is not what Trump could do to cripple the health law — it's what he would do. He has addressed the issue only rarely — characterizing the health law as, simply, a disaster — and his plans for it aren't clear. It's one thing to talk about ripping insurance from 20 million people who are newly covered, Bagley said. It's another to actually do it.\n\nHealth policy analysts on both sides of the aisle also still question where health care fits on Trump's priority list.\n\nA big unknown is how aggressive Trump would remain in going beyond rhetorically opposing Obamacare, said Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. His report card as a presidential candidate reads, 'Donald needs to improve his attention, effort, and study habits. He is easily distracted and seems to prefer just picking fights with others.' \n\nPerhaps most important, Cato's Cannon says, is not whether Trump could single-handedly undo the health law, but whether he could undermine it enough to force Congress to take action. If Trump were to do just enough to cause the insurance exchanges to fail, he said, that would put pressure on Congress ... to reopen the law.\n\nEditor's note: A version of this story was first published by Kaiser Health News on Oct. 7.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Affordable Care Act Hits More Road Bumps\n\nIt seems yet another glitch is forcing a delay in a piece of the health law. This time it's how much more insurers can charge smokers. Coupled with last week's announcements of other delays, could there be trouble ahead for the law?\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThis is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nAnd I'm Audie Cornish.\n\nAnother day, another delay of a piece of the federal health care law known as Obamacare. The administration is having trouble setting up some of the new computer systems required by the Affordable Care Act. Last week, they announced a year-long delay in the implementation of some of the law's requirements for businesses. Today, it's smokers who are affected. Critics say this is more evidence that the administration is not ready to roll out the law, which takes effect in October.\n\nNPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner is here in the studio to explain. Hey there, Julie.\n\nJULIE ROVNER, BYLINE: Hey, Audie.\n\nCORNISH: All right, so this rule for smokers, this was supposed to deal with smokers who would choose to get coverage through the new health insurance exchanges. And they would have faced some surcharges or penalties for that habit, right?\n\nROVNER: That's right. The law allows insurance companies in these new marketplaces, the exchanges, to charge higher premiums for people who smoke - up to one and a half times the premiums that nonsmokers will be paying. But some insurers had wanted to charge younger smokers a smaller surcharge, if you will, than older smokers. Maybe one and a quarter times instead of one and a half times, since they've been smoking less long and are likely to be healthier overall.\n\nBut it turns out the computer system being developed for the exchanges won't be able to process that, at least not for the first year. So it turns out the smoking surcharges will pretty much have to be the same percentage for all smokers, regardless of age, at least for 2014.\n\nCORNISH: Wow. OK, all of that just because of what is - what, a computer glitch, it sounds like.\n\nROVNER: That's exactly right. The computer can't process it.\n\nCORNISH: All right. Well, now that Congress is back, they are reacting to the major delay we've been talking about, which is this rule for businesses. The administration is postponing the requirement for employers to provide coverage or face a penalty. What have you been hearing from lawmakers?\n\nROVNER: Well, here was Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of many who were complaining about these rules.\n\nSENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Now, I agree it's a terrible law. I understand why people harmed by it would want it changed. In fact, I think we ought to repeal it altogether and opt instead for real reforms that would actually lower costs. But the fact is, for now at least, it is the law. And it's the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law.\n\nCORNISH: So, constitutional duty to enforce the law. Does the president have the authority to delay these pieces of the law?\n\nROVNER: Well, that's clearly going to be the subject of a lot of debate. But it appears most likely, particularly in the case of the employer requirement, the administration probably does have the authority. And even if it doesn't, it's not clear who would be able to show enough harm to go to court to stop it.\n\nCORNISH: So is there a real sense of what the impact would be, in terms of what this means for businesses or their workers?\n\nROVNER: Well, you know, it doesn't apply to that many people. It only applies to companies with 50 or more full-time workers. More than 96 percent of those firms already provide health insurance. But still, it has set off a huge cry of outrage, particularly from the law's opponents.\n\nCORNISH: All right. Now for people who are keeping track, we're going to talk about a third part of the law that's being delayed. And this has to do with individuals who are buying their own insurance, right?\n\nROVNER: That's right. On these exchanges that we've talked about, this got announced last Friday, the day after the Fourth of July. No coincidence, I think the administration was trying to make this as invisible as possible. And what they said is that, once again, computer problems mean that when people sign up for insurance on the exchanges, if they're eligible for federal subsidies, they won't get their income checked automatically or verified automatically.\n\nWhich means, effectively, they'll be on the honor system to get that federal help. Again, just for this first year, until they can get all the right computers to be able to talk to each other.\n\nCORNISH: The honor system. I'm sure there are people worried about fraud, right?\n\nROVNER: Absolutely. The administration says that that won't necessarily be a problem. It will go back and audit people's claims and compare what they put on their insurance applications to their tax returns. And if they end up owing money they'll have to pay it back, which will be the case when the computer matching system is in place also, by the way.\n\nRemember, whenever you get money from the government - whether it's a student loan or a tax refund or whatever - you're legally promising you're telling the truth when you sign that form.\n\nCORNISH: So we're talking about what seems like minor glitches, right - the smokers thing or some of these other rules. But at some point, does all this sort of combine to create a sense that the rollout of the law is kind of coming off the rails?\n\nROVNER: Well, I think that's exactly what the administration is most worried about. They want this law to have a sense of inevitability, particularly with the opponents still so very vocal and outspoken. And while all these glitches and delays won't really affect how many people will or won't get health insurance, they do create a perception, first, that things aren't going as well as the administration keeps saying. And second, that there may be other shoes yet to drop.\n\nCORNISH: Julie, thanks so much for walking us through it.\n\nROVNER: Thank you.\n\nCORNISH: That's NPR's Julie Rovner.\n\nCopyright © 2013 NPR.

How Will Members Of Congress Respond To The Green New Deal?\n\nHow will Democrats and Republicans in Congress react to the signature proposal from the freshman congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nMore than 50 lawmakers are co-sponsoring the Green New Deal resolution, which we have published first at npr.org. NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro has been reading, and he's on the line. Good morning, Domenico.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: What do you see?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, you know, the - this Green New Deal is obviously something that Democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. They know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.\n\nINSKEEP: Although this doesn't actually do any of those things. It just sets a framework for what ought to be done.\n\nMONTANARO: Right. There aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that Democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, Democrats did win the House on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by Republicans previously.\n\nINSKEEP: When you're talking about moderates, help me understand what you're talking about here, Domenico. You're saying that - I don't know - Texas Democrats, who gained some ground in the last election, might be a little worried about signing on to the idea of phasing out fossil fuels. That sort of thing?\n\nMONTANARO: Well, and that this costs trillions and trillions of dollars. I mean, the fact is that people want to know how much their energy bill is going to be each month. And that's, frankly, as you know, the biggest thing that you can think about. It's - well, how it affects your paycheck and your pocketbook. And if you have extra money on hand, that's one thing.\n\nBut figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. And deficit spending - obviously something that Democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of Republicans on in some of their tax cuts.\n\nINSKEEP: Very briefly, what struck your ear, more broadly, as you listened to this lawmaker talking about rediscovering the power of public imagination, as she put it?\n\nMONTANARO: She's going to have to figure out a political strategy because real change - for example, when President Obama was in office, when LBJ was in office to enact the Great Society measures or Obamacare - came from having numbers and assembling coalitions. And that's something she's going to have to learn how to do.\n\nINSKEEP: Domenico, thanks very much for the insight. Really appreciate it.\n\nMONTANARO: You're welcome.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. And he speaks on this day, when some Democrats will release a Green New Deal resolution.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Government Hurtles Toward Midnight Shutdown\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11:16 p.m. ET\n\nA partial government shutdown now looks inevitable after the Senate lacks the votes on a stopgap spending bill late Friday night.\n\nThe vote was 50-48 in favor of the measure with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., yet to vote.\n\nThe White House, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats were unable to reach a deal to get to the 60 votes needed to proceed after a flurry of meetings, leading to finger-pointing and blame over who was responsible for the unprecedented shutdown on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration.\n\nShutdowns are usually the product of divided government, but this likely shutdown would be the first time one occurred when the same party controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nRepublicans stepped up their attacks on Democrats throughout the day Friday, blaming them for forcing the standoff. McConnell, R-Ky., accused Democrats of using immigration as a bargaining chip in the fight.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., traveled Friday afternoon to the White House to meet with President Trump, and the White House struck an optimistic tone afterward, but ultimately the high-level meeting proved unsuccessful.\n\nSenate Democrats stood firm in refusing to vote for a stopgap measure without an agreement for long-term increases in military and domestic spending and a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700,000 immigrants. Those are individuals who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program established by the Obama administration. Those protections from deportation are set to begin expiring in March after the Trump administration announced it was rescinding DACA last year.\n\nMcConnell could vote no on the measure for procedural reasons so that he reserves the ability to bring up a substitute bill later. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was not present for the vote.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Joe Manchin, W.Va.; Joe Donnelly, Ind.; Heidi Heitkamp, N.D.; and Claire McCaskill, Mo. — all four in competitive re-election races in states that Trump won — ended up crossing party lines to vote for the bill, along with newly-elected Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. But four Republicans also voted no — Sens. Lindsey Graham, S.C; Rand Paul, Ky.; Mike Lee, Utah; and Jeff Flake, Ariz., meaning that a majority of Republicans failed to vote for the measure.\n\nI am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days by voting for a continuing resolution, Graham said Thursday, though late Friday he was pushing for a three-week stopgap measure he said he would be able to support. It's time Congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up and act consistent with the values of a great nation, Graham also said Thursday.\n\nDemocrats launched into a last-minute flurry of talks late Thursday after a House vote to approve a short-term spending bill to keep the government open until Feb. 16 and fund the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for six years. Schumer and McConnell have said they want to avoid a shutdown, but both Senate leaders have become increasingly insistent that they are unwilling to compromise on their demands.\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans argued they had more than a month to agree to an immigration package before DACA is set to expire and called on Democrats to back the short-term bill in order to give them more time to negotiate.\n\nRepublicans are already dubbing it the Schumer Shutdown. The minority leader had warned Republicans that they will not have enough Democratic votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold. Late Friday night as the vote happened, the hashtag TrumpShutdown was trending across the U.S. on Twitter.\n\nThe Senate had convened Friday morning, but lawmakers and aides said even then there was no consensus on how to head off the impending midnight partial government shutdown.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who runs Senate Democrats' 2018 campaign operation, told NPR's Morning Edition Friday that Democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to four days to keep the government running and give negotiators more time to clinch deals in stalled immigration and budget talks.\n\nPolitics DREAMers Caught Up In Efforts To Keep The Government Open DREAMers Caught Up In Efforts To Keep The Government Open Listen · 7:53 7:53\n\nI'm not voting for a government shutdown. I'm voting to get an agreement to move forward, Van Hollen said. Let's stay in. Let's get it done.\n\nVan Hollen also said Trump, not the Democrats, will shoulder the blame if a shutdown occurs. If the president of the United States, whether by design or incompetence is going to shut down the government, that is a big problem, Van Hollen said. I hope he will show some leadership; he says he's the great negotiator.\n\nNew data seems to agree. A Washington Post-ABC News poll out Friday found that 48 percent of Americans would blame Trump and Republicans for a shutdown, compared with 28 percent who would blame Democrats. The rest of the participants either blamed both equally or had no opinion. A CNN poll also out Friday found similar numbers blaming the president and Republicans in Congress over Democrats, though 56 percent said approving a budget deal was more important than a DACA deal, while just over a third said they wanted an immigration compromise included.\n\nStill, the Trump White House had worked hard to shift blame back to the Democrats.\n\nThere is no way you could lay this at the feet of the president of the United States, said Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a press conference Friday morning.\n\nThe reality is Republicans are united in keeping the government open. Democrats are united in trying to shut it down, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told NPR's Morning Edition Friday.\n\nShort downplayed the merits of an even shorter stopgap, arguing that negotiators need more time to reach an immigration deal to determine the fate of the hundreds of thousands of people in the DACA program.\n\nI think we're making progress on DACA, but I think it's unrealistic to think there's going to be a solution in the next five days, Short said.\n\nRepublicans have also sought to call attention to what they see as hypocrisy from the Democratic leadership, who loudly criticized Republicans in 2013 when the government last shut down, over Affordable Care Act disagreements.\n\nThe House passed the four-week stopgap on Thursday, 230-197, with just six Democrats voting with Republicans. The measure included a six-year renewal of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program and further delays of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThere was ostensibly Democratic support for all of those provisions, but the vast majority of Democrats oppose the stopgap because of the ongoing inability to reach a bipartisan immigration deal. Democrats are also withholding support for a longer-term spending deal until an immigration deal is clinched.\n\nThis vote should be a no-brainer, McConnell said Friday morning on the Senate floor. And it would be, except the Democratic leader has convinced his members to filibuster any funding bill that doesn't include legislation they are demanding for people who came into the United States illegally.\n\nThe president has been an erratic negotiator in recent days, throwing already-contentious talks into disarray. After initially suggesting he would support any bipartisan proposal lawmakers could come up with, Trump rejected a proposal authored by Graham, a Republican, and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on the advice of more conservative lawmakers and his own top White House aides.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nTrump was also seemingly at odds with his own chief of staff, John Kelly, over the president's continued support for building a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly told Fox News this week that Trump was flexible on the wall, to which Trump later tweeted: The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\n\nTrump further complicated budget negotiations on Thursday with a series of tweets that suggested he opposed the House stopgap bill. The White House put out a statement later that he did support it, and the president ultimately helped win over reluctant House conservatives to vote for the bill.\n\nMost Americans would not feel the effects of a partial government shutdown. However, hundreds of thousands of federal workers would face furloughs.\n\nThe military would still go to work, they will not get paid. The border will still be patrolled, they will not get paid, said Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Folks will still be fighting the fires out West, they will not get paid. Parks will be open, people won't get paid.\n\nAll national security and military personnel deemed essential would continue to report to work, but they wouldn't get paid. That includes active-duty U.S. troops, unless Congress passes separate legislation to make sure their paychecks go out. Lawmakers, however, face no such threat. Members of Congress continue to get paid in a government shutdown.\n\nIt costs more to shut down the government than to keep it running. Standard & Poor's estimated that the 2013 government shutdown, lasting 16 days, cost the economy $24 billion and shaved 0.6 percent off the economic growth for the fourth quarter that year.
What To Do If You Just Lost Health Insurance With Your Job\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic poses both a public health and an economic crisis. Squarely in the middle of those concerns are fears about medical bills and loss of employer-provided health insurance.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a public health crisis, also an economic crisis. Nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in just the last two weeks, and no job often means no health insurance. So what are the coverage options for those newly jobless or for those who never had insurance to begin with? - questions for NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\nHey, Selena.\n\nSELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.\n\nKELLY: So for the millions of people who have just filed for unemployment, what are their coverage options?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So like all things health insurance, it's a bit complicated. It depends on where you live, but there are three big buckets to look at. And the first is COBRA; so if you worked for an employer with 20 or more workers, you have access to COBRA. It's basically exactly the same coverage that you had before, but it can be really expensive - hundreds of dollars in premiums - and your employer isn't chipping in to defray that.\n\nThen the second thing is Obamacare insurance exchanges. Losing job-based coverage is a qualifying event, so you can shop for a plan there. The third option is Medicaid, so the rules about who qualifies varies from state to state, but it's based on monthly income. You have to make less than $1,400 a month for yourself or $3,000 a month for a family of four in most states to qualify.\n\nKELLY: It sounds a little daunting with all of those buckets and so many things to look at and check on. Where do I go just to find out what I can get?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: If you qualify for COBRA, you will be contacted. But if not, you should just start with healthcare.gov, and that'll direct you to the right place for your state.\n\nKELLY: OK. What about another group of people - people who maybe didn't have coverage to begin with before this pandemic? That's a number - that's, like, 27 million people who didn't have insurance.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, it's really a lot of people. So 6 million of that 27 million actually do qualify for Medicaid. They just don't know it. So they can go and enroll at any time. Beyond that, if you don't qualify for Medicaid, then you might be able to go to the Obamacare exchanges. A dozen or more states that run their own marketplaces have opened what's called a special enrollment period. So if you live in one of those states, you can shop there. You don't have to prove you just had a job loss or something like that.\n\nKELLY: Oh, OK.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: In states that don't run their own exchanges, there's a bit of a problem. The Trump administration has decided not to open a federal special enrollment period, and that means there are probably several million people who will fall into a coverage gap and not be able to enroll in Medicaid or an Obamacare marketplace plan.\n\nKELLY: There was an exchange about that yesterday during the White House press briefing, and Vice President Pence got asked about it. He didn't really answer the question, as I recall. President Trump jumped in and said, it's something we're going to look at, but no specifics.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. It's a reminder of the politics here. The very law that expanded Medicaid and created these insurance exchanges is the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare. So Trump feels he was elected in part on his promise to get rid of that law. Congress wasn't able to do it back in 2017. The administration is still fighting to strike it down now in court. This fall, the Supreme Court is planning to hear the Trump administration's arguments against the law. So this might all explain the reluctance here to make use of Obamacare by making a special enrollment period that could be seen as an admission that the law is helpful during this crisis.\n\nKELLY: Last question, Selena - what if I'm one of the lucky ones who has insurance but then I'm unlucky and I get the coronavirus and I get COVID-19 and I get sick? What is covered?\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: So testing is covered if you can get a test. It's still not very widespread. Congress passed that into law that it must be covered. Treatment is still an open question. If you do end up in the hospital, even with insurance, you might end up paying thousands in deductibles or co-pays. A few insurance companies are waiving those patient costs, and others might follow suit. There is one more worry here I wanted to mention. Hospitals and doctors can also bill patients directly. Those are surprise bills or balance bills. That has not been addressed by Congress, so that's another worry for folks in addition to all the other worries.\n\nKELLY: All righty (ph). Thanks, Selena.\n\nSIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.\n\nKELLY: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Reexamining Mike Pence's Record On Health Care As Indiana Governor\n\nVice President Pence is now in charge of U.S. coronavirus response, prompting a look back at his health record as Indiana governor facing an HIV outbreak, a drug epidemic and Medicaid expansion.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump has put his No. 2 in charge of the U.S. response to the new coronavirus.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me. But he's got a certain talent for this.\n\nKELLY: It is true that Vice President Mike Pence has dealt with public health crises before. When he was governor of Indiana, five years ago, his state faced an outbreak of a different kind - a cluster of HIV cases linked to the opioid epidemic. Jake Harper is an investigative health reporter with WFYI in Indianapolis. He covered that outbreak. He joins me now.\n\nJake Harper, welcome.\n\nJAKE HARPER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.\n\nKELLY: So take me back to 2015. What exactly happened? How did this HIV outbreak begin?\n\nHARPER: So in early 2015, the state announced that people in Austin, Ind., were contracting HIV. Austin's a small rural town sort of near the Kentucky border. It has little more than 4,000 people, but that outbreak eventually grew to more than 200 who were infected with HIV. The virus was spreading through injection drug use. People were taking this painkiller, injecting it. At the same time, they were sharing their needles and spreading HIV.\n\nSo back when this was happening, I went to Austin. And I met a man named Kevin Polly. And he told me that the very same day he found out he was infected with HIV, another woman asked to share his needle.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKEVIN POLLY: She said, Kevin, I've got a problem. She said, I've got this pill but no needle. She said, can I use yours? And honey, I just tested positive for HIV. Well, we've used before; you know, it don't matter. Oh, my God, honey, it does matter. Before, I didn't know I was sick. I let her use my needle - the last one. Should have never happened.\n\nKELLY: It did happen. They weren't the only ones. And it became this crisis to which then-Governor Mike Pence responded how?\n\nHARPER: Critics would say that Governor Pence responded too slowly. Many people were calling for Indiana to legalize syringe exchange programs, where someone who uses drugs can bring their used needles and get clean ones. Other states allow this, and they help prevent infections. But Pence was really resistant to that idea for a while. Here he is back in 2015.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I don't believe that effective anti-drug policy involves handing out paraphernalia to drug users by government officials. I reject that.\n\nHARPER: Pence actually took another month to think about it after the state announced the outbreak, and then he reluctantly authorized a needle exchange in Scott County.\n\nKELLY: One other thing about his record - which is that Pence is an evangelical Christian. Bernie Sanders - Senator Sanders, who's running for the Democratic presidential nominee, he was tweeting Trump's plan to deal with all this is to have Pence, quote, who wanted to pray away HIV epidemic oversee the response.\n\nFact-check that for us. Did Mike Pence try to pray away HIV?\n\nHARPER: I don't think so. I think the quote from him was that he was going to go home and pray on the decision of whether to authorize a needle exchange. He ended up authorizing the exchange, but I don't get the sense from reading that quote that he was trying to pray away the problem of HIV.\n\nKELLY: OK. Questions also being raised today about the wisdom of putting Pence in charge with coronavirus because of his role in slashing the public health budget in Indiana when he was governor, which prompts me to ask - did Mike Pence, as governor, do anything that public health officials liked?\n\nHARPER: Sure. So Pence, as a Republican, under Obamacare, did expand Medicaid. He did it with restrictions. So people who need insurance, many of them need to pay a premium in order to get coverage, and they face getting kicked off or getting bumped down to a lower level of coverage if they don't pay. But that program did bring health insurance to a lot of people who didn't have it before, and that helps with public health issues like addiction.\n\nKELLY: But bottom line - how relevant is Mike Pence's experience as governor dealing with health issues in Indiana to his ability to handle the coronavirus in 2020?\n\nHARPER: Well, it's Pence and his entire health team seem to have gone with him to D.C.

As GOP Hails Barrett, Democrats Convene A Parallel Hearing: About Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:28 a.m. ET\n\nDemocrats on Monday executed an old move from the playbook used by a party when it doesn't control the majority during a big hearing: changing the subject.\n\nRanking Member Dianne Feinstein of California and her colleagues don't have the votes to stop Judge Amy Coney Barrett from being confirmed to the Supreme Court by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the full chamber. All they have is the time they can talk between members of the majority.\n\nOn Monday, they used it to talk about what they called the real subject of the proceedings this week: the desire by President Trump and Republicans to sink the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, via a ruling from the high court.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., scolded Republicans for what he called the screaming-tire 180 they'd pulled since 2016, when they declined to hear President Obama's nominee for the court that year until after Election Day.\n\nNow, Whitehouse observed, We get this mad-dash rush. Why? Look at the Supreme Court calendar.\n\nA case scheduled for mid-November could grant an opportunity for a court with a new conservative majority to fire a torpedo into Obamacare, the Democrats charged — and Barrett herself embodies that weapon.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leah Millis/Pool/Getty Images Leah Millis/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., argued that Republicans had failed to pull down or reform Obamacare via legislation, including when they had total control in Washington, and now they're hoping to send Barrett to do so.\n\nDemocrats used their time to tell stories about constituents whom they said had been helped by the ACA, including an Illinoisan, in Durbin's case, who might have had a child's coverage cut off and a Rhode Islander, in Whitehouse's case, who might not have been able to go ahead with a kidney transplant.\n\nThe Democrats showed Barrett huge photos of the constituents whose stories they told, including with big placards that staff members set up behind Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n\nWith such stories coming in from around the country, why would we rush forward? Whitehouse asked.
Lightning Fill In The Blank\n\nAll the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nTime for our final game, Lightning Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as they can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?\n\nBILL KURTIS: I sure can. Peter has two. Roxanne and Roy each have three.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\nSAGAL: So that means Peter is in third place. And you're up first.\n\nPETER GROSZ: Great.\n\nSAGAL: The clock will start when I begin your first question, Peter. Fill in the blank.

And when police attempted to arrest him, he gave the cops a fake name. That probably would have worked if Bushman did not have his full name tattooed in giant letters on his neck. It also didn't help that he was also wearing a nametag from a recent forgers convention...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: ...That said, hello, my name is guilty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Peter do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Real good - six right, 12 more points, total of 14.

One of those...\n\nSAGAL: No.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: They had students - during this test to keep them from cheating, they had students wear cardboard boxes on their heads. A recent picture showed university students taking an exam while wearing these cardboard boxes with small cut out eye holes presumably to keep students from looking to their left or right and cheating off the person next to them. Or maybe just every student had ended up with a bad Halloween costume. The school has since apologized for doing this to their students. They say that when it comes to future ideas for preventing cheating, they'll try and think outside the box.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Roy do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: He got three right, six more points, total of nine.

Not all Californians are pleased with the bill. Especially California's many vegetarians were finding it difficult to run over an acai bowl.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, did Roxanne do well enough to win?\n\nKURTIS: She needed six. She got six. So she wins.\n\n(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)\n\nKURTIS: Twelve more points, 15, and the winner.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Analyzing Obamacare's Impact In Arizona\n\nWith the collapse of the Republicans' health care bill, we consider the impact on Arizona, a state where many have benefited from Obamacare, but others have been hard hit by rising insurance premiums.\n\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nIt was a tumultuous week in Washington with President Trump and House Republicans unable to agree on a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. So Obamacare remains, as Speaker Paul Ryan said, the law of the land. So how is that law playing out for people? Critics often point to Arizona as a state where the Affordable Care Act has not worked out well. Reporter Will Stone joins us from member station KJZZ in Tempe to talk about the ACA in Arizona.\n\nHello.\n\nWILL STONE, BYLINE: Hello. Great to be here.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So the president and others, as I mentioned, point to a sharp rise in insurance premiums in Arizona since Obamacare became law. How big an issue is this for the people of Arizona?\n\nSTONE: It really depends on who you talk to. The number that was held up repeatedly was an average increase of about 116 percent for the benchmark plan here. The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. The Republican replacement for that would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona. And the question would have been - how would people have afforded premiums?\n\nThe real problem, though, has been the marketplace and how insurers have slowly left. This is having an impact - the high deductibles and the lack of options - on real people. I spoke with a mother, Corrine Bobby (ph), who lives just north of Phoenix. And her daughter was born with a complex congenital heart disease. And so she was thrilled when the ACA happened and her daughter could get coverage. But even to this day, she can't afford insurance for the rest of her family.\n\nCORRINE BOBBY: It's amazing that my daughter has this lifesaving care now. But you're going to force me to pay a penalty for something that I can't afford for the rest of us. But that shouldn't be my problem. My problem should be which insurance company I should be getting. That would be my problem.\n\nSTONE: They were looking at premiums costing the rest of them $400 to $600 a month and deductibles of more than $6,000 per person. And they just decided, you know, it's not worth it.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: But there are people who have benefited?\n\nSTONE: Yes, people - the 200,000 people in the marketplace, many of whom can now afford insurance with the tax credits. And then 400,000 plus people in Arizona benefited from Medicaid expansion. And that was the big concern here when - as the Republicans moved to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So what are Arizona politicians saying now that it's clear the ACA will be with us for the foreseeable future?\n\nSTONE: Our members of Congress were divided about whether they were going to support this bill or not. We had two members who had said they would vote for the bill. And then we had members in the far-right Freedom Caucus who said it did not go far enough, and they were going to oppose it.\n\nSo I think we will see our representatives in Congress saying we still need to do something about this law, and it needs to be something that works and actually brings down costs. And I'm sure some people here are breathing a sigh of relief because the Republican replacement could have forced some tough decisions for things like Medicaid here in Arizona.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So what's next? Is there anything the state government can do to fix the problems with how the ACA is working in Arizona? Or do Arizonans just wait for it to explode as the president has suggested it will?\n\nSTONE: This is mostly in the hands of the federal government right now. Arizona was not one of the states that set up its own exchange. It participates in the healthcare.gov. And leading up to open enrollment last year, we saw the federal governor making efforts to woo insurers back into the marketplace, even after they were concerned about costs and losing money. The question is - will the Trump administration do the same? - and I think that's what a lot of folks who rely on the coverage right now are wondering.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: That's reporter Will Stone. He's part of a reporting partnership between NPR, Kaiser Health News and member station KJZZ.\n\nThanks so much for being with us.\n\nSTONE: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

How Trump Could Repeal Several Parts Of The Affordable Care Act\n\nPresident-elect Trump and Congress have a couple of options in deciding how to best repeal the Affordable Care Act, each with dramatically different impacts. NPR sorts through the options and looks at how existing Obamacare insurance plans will be affected.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nTrump has said one of his top priorities as president is to repeal and replace Obamacare, but Senate Democrats could make an outright repeal tough. Trump says he'll consider keeping two popular provisions, a requirement that insurers cover people with existing conditions and another that lets children stay on their parents' policies until age 26.\n\nAs NPR's Alison Kodjak reports, there are several ways to get rid of the rest of the health care law but not without creating major disruptions in the insurance market.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Democrats who supported the Affordable Care Act could use their filibuster power to block Trump and congressional Republicans from directly repealing the law. But there is a workaround. For bills related to the budget or taxes, the filibuster doesn't apply. And Republicans in Congress gave it a test drawn earlier this year.\n\nJOHN MCDONOUGH: Last fall and January of this year, they demonstrated quite convincingly that they could frame a budget reconciliation bill, get it through the House, get it through the Senate, get it to the president's desk, which they did. President Obama vetoed it. President Trump would sign that bill.\n\nKODJAK: That's John McDonough, a professor at Harvard who is a Senate staffer who worked on Obamacare. He says if a similar bill passes next year without a replacement...\n\nMCDONOUGH: Then we are looking at a national holy mess in the insurance market like we've never seen before.\n\nKODJAK: That's because the parts of the law that can be repealed in a budget bill are the ones that make the health insurance market function, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nKAREN POLLITZ: The mandate to have health insurance or pay a penalty, the mandate on employers to provide health benefits and the tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies that make it affordable for people to get health insurance would be repealed.\n\nKODJAK: What can't be reversed that easily - the parts of the law that prevent insurers from discriminating against sick people.\n\nPOLLITZ: You can't be turned down based on your health status. You can't charge customers more based on their health status.\n\nKODJAK: All of which make health insurance more expensive. Pollitz says this combination would lead healthy people who think insurance is too expensive to drop their policies and sick people to buy. Insurance companies will then raise prices to account for their sicker customer base, leaving more people to drop insurance.\n\nPOLLITZ: And that's what sometimes is referred to as the death spiral.\n\nKODJAK: As in killing the insurance market. An even faster way for a President Trump to deal a blow to Obamacare would be to drop an Obama administration appeal of a court ruling against the law.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge ruled that subsidies designed to cut the costs in some policies are illegal. That's because Congress didn't appropriate money for the payments which go to health insurers. Dropping the appeal would leave the court ruling in place.\n\nPOLLITZ: That would either force them to jack up premiums or to just face tremendous losses.\n\nKODJAK: Under either scenario, these experts say, the changes could lead to the end of the individual health insurance market.

With Trump Tapping Into Economic Fears, Wisconsin Turns Red For First Time Since 1984\n\nThe last time Wisconsin voted for a Republican for President was 1984. That all changed on November 8. We go to Kenosha County to ask why.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nUntil Tuesday, a Republican presidential candidate hadn't won the state of Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan did it back in 1984. Donald Trump eked out a very narrow victory there, adding to his tally of Rust Belt states that turned red this year and put him over the top. NPR's Melissa Block went to a traditionally blue Wisconsin county to ask why.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, BYLINE: Kenosha County is the kind of place Democrats didn't used to have to worry about. The last time it went for a Republican for president was 1972, Richard Nixon. And now, in 2016, Donald Trump - he won Kenosha County by 255 votes.\n\nGABE NUDO: Make America great - that's what we need.\n\nBLOCK: Elated Trump voter Gabe Nudo has stopped by the Republican Party campaign office here to pick up a post-victory Trump-Pence T-shirt. He's retired, used to work on the line at American Motors assembling cars, a former union guy.\n\nNUDO: Originally, I'm from Italy. So I'm an immigrant - legal immigrant.\n\nNUDO: Nudo likes Trump's hard line on illegal immigration, calls Obamacare bad news, thinks Hillary Clinton should be in jail.\n\nERIN DECKER: People love the Hillary for prison buttons in the fantastic orange background with the prison bars (laughter).\n\nBLOCK: Erin Decker is the Republican Party chair for Kenosha County. She's excited about most of Trump's promises and shrugs off some of his volatile rhetoric. For example, his signature pledge to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it - nah.\n\nDECKER: I don't think we can be building the Great Wall of China at our southern border. I believe that was campaign - you know, get your base fired up.\n\nBLOCK: Here in the industrial Midwest, Decker says voters heard an economic message that tapped into their fears.\n\nDECKER: We're a manufacturing, blue-collar state. And the blue-collar workers - what Trump was saying resounded with them.\n\nBLOCK: Kenosha County, in the southeast corner of Wisconsin, sits between Milwaukee and Chicago. It's anchored by the city of Kenosha, a former manufacturing hub on Lake Michigan. The car industry that used to be the pride of Kenosha, with union jobs that reliably fueled the Democratic machine - it's all gone.\n\nBOB WIRCH: This is the former site of American Motors, and then it was Chrysler.\n\nBLOCK: Now we drive past an empty swath of land the size of 80 football fields. Our tour guide is Democratic State Senator Bob Wirch. Back in the day, he worked at another factory here that's long gone, American Brass.\n\nWIRCH: I was a college kid, came in looking for a job. And the old-timers shook hands with me. And I noticed how many of them were missing fingers. And they said, oh, what job do you want? I said, I think I'll be sweeper.\n\nBLOCK: He smiles and wiggles his 10 fingers. New business has come to Kenosha County. A gigantic Amazon fulfillment center sprawls alongside the interstate. But those thousand-plus jobs are non-union. And Senator Wirch has seen Wisconsin unions take a pounding. Last year, Republican Governor Scott Walker signed a bill making Wisconsin a right-to-work state. And earlier, he pushed through controversial legislation that ended collective bargaining for public sector workers. Wirch says those measures and the decline of industry here have hurt Democrats at the ballot box.\n\nWIRCH: It ain't like it used to be. It used to be thousands of machinists union people and steel workers and UAW. And they could just get them out to vote, and it was a powerful thing.\n\nBLOCK: Wirch says Democrats made a fatal mistake assuming they had Wisconsin in the bag. Hillary Clinton didn't visit Wisconsin once after the primary here, which she lost to Bernie Sanders by double digits.\n\nAt the Kenosha Ice Arena, we find Jacki Olsen (ph) watching her son at nighttime peewee hockey practice. She voted twice for Obama - this time, for Trump. It's not that she feels negative about Clinton, she says.\n\nJACKI OLSEN: I would just like to see something change. I felt like the Democrats just couldn't get anything done.\n\nBLOCK: This echoes a lot of what we heard from Trump voters here, a rejection of the status quo. Few voters could point to a specific way they think their life will change for the better under a President Trump.\n\nOLSEN: We're just kind of hoping that, you know, as crazy as Trump is, that maybe he's just got the guts to actually make things happen. We're hoping - but we're hoping it won't go too far the other way and (laughter) make too many people mad.\n\nBLOCK: Olsen says let's give this a try and see if it works. One thing's for sure - next time around, Democrats won't be taking Wisconsin for granted.\n\nMelissa Block NPR News, Kenosha.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

For Many, Fewer Obamacare Choices Doesn't Mean Higher Prices\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Galewitz/KHN Phil Galewitz/KHN\n\nPeople in Columbia, S.C., had their pick of four health insurers last year when they shopped for policies during the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment.\n\nThis time they have just one: Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, which had the most Obamacare enrollees in Richland County in 2016 due to its low prices.\n\nIt's a change that's been repeated around the country after big health insurers such as Aetna, Humana and United Healthcare pulled out of dozens of Obamacare marketplaces that they judged unprofitable.\n\nAlmost a third of all counties in the United States have just one insurer in the marketplace for people buying individual coverage for 2017. In 2015, just 7 percent had one insurer, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. Twenty percent of Obamacare consumers will choose 2017 plans in counties served by a single insurer, according to the government.\n\nBut there's a surprising bottom line: Although prices are going up in almost all areas, they're not significantly higher than they are for people living in areas served by multiple insurers, according to data reviewed by consulting firm Avalere Health.\n\nA lack of competition is bad for the insurance market in the long term, but in counties that have only one plan it hasn't proven to be catastrophic for consumers for 2017, says Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president with Avalere. We expected to see the biggest price hikes in areas without competition.\n\nShe suggests that didn't happen because insurers had to file their initial 2017 rates to regulators earlier this year, before they knew exactly where competitors were dropping out.\n\nThose rates could be adjusted, but broadly the pricing was set in the absence of full competitive information, Pearson says. When open enrollment for 2018 begins next fall, you could see big price increases in regions without competition.\n\nUncertainty surrounds the future of the exchanges after the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress take power. Worries about the future of Obamacare may be spurring a burst in enrollments, which were up by 400,000 to 6.4 million from Nov. 1 to Dec. 19, compared with the same period last year, the government reported.\n\nEven in Richland County, where premium increases exceeded the average rate hike nationwide, individuals and the navigators who help them enroll say they have found good deals — especially for people with lower incomes that make them eligible for subsidies.\n\nOpen enrollment for 2017 ends Jan. 31, with a few exceptions.\n\nRichland was one of 74 counties that dropped from at least four insurers in 2016 to just one in 2017, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of federal data for the 39 states that enroll people through healthcare.gov. In 66 of those counties, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated plan was the sole survivor.\n\nBlue Cross plans generally dominated the individual insurance market before the 2010 health law was passed, and they have recaptured their place in many cities and counties, says Pearson. That helped them outlast insurers such as UnitedHealthcare and Humana, which lacked that experience when they began selling individual plans under Obamacare in 2014. Even so, Blue Cross plans have withdrawn from Nebraska and Minnesota for 2017, as well as from densely populated counties in Arizona and Tennessee.\n\nIn some ways the individual market looks today much like it did before the ACA, from a competitive standpoint, Pearson says.\n\nStephanie Hickman, 29, of West Columbia, S.C., feared the worst when she began shopping for 2017 coverage on the exchange with help from a federally funded navigator at the downtown library. Hickman was uninsured most of the year, and paid $200 a month for her prescription drugs.\n\nAfter sorting 20 options, the certified nursing assistant was stunned to find a subsidized plan that would cost her $22.30 a month and not more than $700 a year out-of-pocket in co-pays and deductibles. She would pay nothing to see a primary care doctor.\n\nWow, it seems almost too good to be true, says Hickman, who makes about $16,000 a year.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Galewitz/KHN Phil Galewitz/KHN\n\nThe impact of subsidies makes Hickman's case pretty typical, says Shelli Quenga, director of programs for the nonprofit Palmetto Project, which hires navigators to help enroll people in Obamacare.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the nearly 13 million people who enrolled for coverage on the marketplace last year qualified for subsidies, which are pegged to the price of the second-lowest silver premiums. That means that as the cost of the silver plans rise, so do the subsidies.\n\nBut that doesn't help the millions of people with higher incomes who don't qualify for subsidies and are facing higher premiums. For them, the loss of insurance competition and higher rates has been a double blow, according to insurance agents. People are getting slammed and having to pay through the nose, says Jocelyn Boland, an insurance agent in the Columbia, S.C., area who is handling about 500 Obamacare clients this year. I have a lot of upset people.\n\nDespite the higher prices and promises by president-elect Donald Trump and GOP leaders to repeal the health law in 2017, most are still signing up, she says.\n\nSeventy miles south of Columbia, Augusta, Ga., is also down to just one Obamacare insurer after having four in 2016. Among those who have signed up for the remaining Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia plan, some are thrilled at low rates and others, not so much.\n\nDorothy Johnson, 57, a caterer who lives in a mobile home with her disabled husband, was disappointed that the lowest Obamacare premium would still cost her $56 a month, even with a subsidy.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Phil Galewitz/KHN Phil Galewitz/KHN\n\nSitting with navigator Monica Baldwin inside a converted storage room just big enough for a desk and two chairs at Christ Community Health Services, Johnson broke down in tears when told that if she did not enroll, she would owe the IRS the higher of $695 or 2 percent of her income under the health law's individual mandate. She and her husband live on $1,400 a month, mostly from his disability check and her part-time job, Johnson says. She gets around in a 1994 car and after paying the electric bill, trash, food, gas and car insurance, there is little left.\n\nWell, just go ahead and enroll me because there's no way I want to pay the government that penalty, Johnson told Baldwin.\n\nShe and her husband had been shopping for life insurance, but they've decided they can't afford it as well as health insurance.\n\nThe Augusta area lost Humana, Cigna and Coventry health plans for next year. Humana was the most popular plan because of its price and its inclusion of University Hospital, one of four major area hospitals which Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia does not cover.\n\nBut so far, Baldwin says, most people are switching to the Blue Cross plans without complaint. Joel Caceres, 27, of Augusta, said he is pleased that his monthly premium for the same subsidized Blue Cross plan that he had in 2016 will drop to $40 from $43 and his annual deductible will stay at $250. The pastry chef says subsidized coverage is vital for him because the insulin and other medications he takes will only cost him $15 a month after insurance. Having the insurance really helps ends meet, he says after Baldwin helped him find a plan.\n\nRon Ellis, 55, another Obamacare customer aided by Baldwin, says he voted for Trump despite his pledge to repeal the law. I didn't like Hillary (Clinton), he says.\n\nHis subsidized monthly premium for his Blue Cross policy will be $65 next year, up slightly from the $63.30 he paid this year. Ellis says he went without health insurance for many years before Obamacare. With high blood pressure, arthritis in his knees and a potential need for another hip replacement, he says, It's been great for me.\n\nElizabeth Lucas contributed to this report.

California Exchange Chief Rips UnitedHealth For Obamacare Excuses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nAmid growing questions over the future of Obamacare exchanges, the head of California's marketplace said the nation's largest private health insurer should take responsibility for nearly $1 billion in losses and stop blaming the federal health law.\n\nIn a blistering critique, Covered California's executive director, Peter Lee, said UnitedHealth Group Inc. made a series of blunders on rates and networks that led to a $475 million loss in 2015 on individual policies across the country. The company estimates a similar exchange-related loss of $500 million in 2016.\n\nInstead of saying, 'We screwed up,' they said, 'Obamacare is the problem and we may not play anymore,'  Lee said in an interview with California Healthline. It was giving an excuse to Wall Street and throwing the Affordable Care Act under the bus.\n\nLee, a staunch defender of the health law and a former official in the Obama administration, has tangled with UnitedHealth in the past. He knocked the company for sitting out the launch of Obamacare in 2014, then welcomed UnitedHealth into Covered California for 2016.\n\nBut now, he said, the company is driving me bonkers because it has fed this political frenzy that Obamacare doesn't work. It's total spin and unanchored in reality.\n\nA company spokesman declined to comment on Lee's criticism, and referred to UnitedHealth's previous statements on the exchange business.\n\nDuring a Nov. 19 conference call with analysts, UnitedHealth's CEO Stephen Hemsley said: We can't really subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself. ... I think that basically is an industrywide proposition.\n\nAn Urban Institute report issued last week, however, found that some of UnitedHealth's troubles may have been self-inflicted. The company's premiums were substantially higher than its competitors' in many of the largest U.S. markets. The insurer also offered broader provider networks that tend to attract sicker customers who incur big medical bills.\n\nIn November, UnitedHealth surprised analysts and health-policy experts with its steep losses and said it might leave the exchanges altogether, just after expanding into new states. The sudden reversal prompted questions about the sustainability of the government-run marketplaces, the linchpin of President Obama's signature law.\n\nUnitedHealth reiterated its dour outlook for the exchange market when it announced quarterly results Jan. 19. The company said it has seen an influx of sicker patients during special enrollment, fewer healthy people signing up and costs rising as a result.\n\nUnitedHealth ended last year with about 500,000 customers in the public exchanges, and it expects membership to grow to about 800,000 during the recent open enrollment. It has said it will decide by midyear whether to continue selling in Obamacare marketplaces.\n\nOther major insurers have expressed similar concerns about doing business in the public exchanges, albeit with less red ink than UnitedHealth.\n\nAnthem Inc., the nation's second-largest health insurer, said last week that its exchange enrollment in California and 13 other states was running about 30 percent below expectations, but the business was still slightly profitable. Anthem ended last year with 791,000 exchange members.\n\nOn Monday, insurance giant Aetna Inc. said it lost up to $140 million, or a negative margin of 3 percent to 4 percent, on individual coverage last year. It has 1 million members with individual policies, about 75 percent of them on public exchanges. The company said it expects to break even this year, however.\n\nOur individual commercial business ended the year with improved results, Aetna's chief executive, Mark Bertolini, said Monday during an earnings conference call. Despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.\n\nIn response to industry criticism, the Obama administration is taking steps to prevent the misuse of special enrollment so people can't wait to sign up until they need care. Special enrollment is designed for people who lose coverage or need to make a change because of an event in their life, such as moving, getting married or having a child.\n\nInsurance markets can't function properly without enough healthy customers paying premiums, which are used to cover expenses incurred by sicker policyholders. The three-month open enrollment period for the federal and state exchanges just ended Jan. 31. California extended its deadline to Feb. 6 for people who already had begun the sign-up process by Sunday.\n\nJohn Holahan, a health-policy researcher at the Urban Institute, said the Obama administration does need to impose stricter rules for special enrollment. He also said concerns over affordability have hampered enrollment because some middle-class consumers and young, healthy people are put off by high premiums and large deductibles.\n\nBut I haven't seen anything that shows the exchanges are really in trouble, Holahan said. That doesn't mean every insurer is going to make it. Some companies don't make it, and that isn't a sign markets are unsustainable.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services expects about 10 million people to be enrolled in federal and state exchanges at the end of 2016. That's far below previous government forecasts.\n\nUnitedHealth sat out Covered California for the first two years before joining in several rural areas. Lee said both sides will be analyzing whether the company returns for 2017. As an active purchaser, Covered California can decide whether or not to contract with certain health plans and allow them on the state exchange.\n\nUnited will be looking at what their prospects are in California, Lee said.\n\nWe will be looking at United as a plan to see if they offer good value for Californians. It's to be determined on both ends.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California HealthCare Foundation.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nLet me ask you a question or two. What do you think of your doctor? And what do you think of America's health care system? NPR has been posing those questions in a survey that was conducted with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We have the results this morning. They'll be presented by NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak, who's in studios. Good morning.\n\nALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So what do we think of the health care we're receiving?\n\nKODJAK: Well, most people actually are pretty happy with their own health care. They like their doctors. They think the care they're getting is pretty good. But there are a couple of really big gaps. If you are lower income, you are much more likely to think your care is not good.\n\nINSKEEP: Oh, so if you have money, you're getting good care. You think so, anyway. If you don't have money, it doesn't feel so good.\n\nKODJAK: That's right.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. So with the exception of many lower-income people who are disappointed, people broadly approve of the health care they individually are getting. What happened though when you asked the same people about the health care system as a whole?\n\nKODJAK: Well, that was a pretty different picture. Almost half of those people said that they didn't like the health care system in their state. They like their own doctor, but they didn't like the way the whole system worked. It's a little like people's attitudes toward Congress. You know, they like their own congressman. They keep re-electing him. But they say they hate the institution of Congress. So we were trying to figure out what's going on there. And so we talked to Georges Benjamin. He's the head of the American Public Health Association. And here's what he said.\n\nGEORGES BENJAMIN: When you're talking about health care, we have this amazing kind of schizophrenia about our system. You know, we deliver the best medicine and nursing on the planet. No question about that. But it requires a lot of things.\n\nKODJAK: Things like insurance, piles of forms, copayments and deductibles and often running from place to place for tests. It's hard to navigate and pretty frustrating. And Benjamin says that's what people hate, trying to navigate the system and trying to figure out how to make clear to your doctors what you need.\n\nWILLIAM DALE COGER: My name is William Dale Coger. I'm 52 years old. I live in Oak Hill, W.Va.\n\nKODJAK: In our poll, Coger rated the health care system poor. He injured his back about 15 years ago hauling pipe out of a water well on his property. It didn't seem too bad at first.\n\nCOGER: It's gotten worse and worse and worse. And now whenever I get up in the mornings, I have to push myself up to sit down on the bed. And then, whenever I get up, I've got to push myself up and sort of limp and lose my balance everywhere until finally my left side starts working properly.\n\nKODJAK: Coger's a carpenter by trade, but now he's on disability and Medicaid. Our new poll shows that lower-income people like Coger are more likely to be dissatisfied with their health care. He sees doctors at a local clinic but says they don't take his back trouble seriously. They recommend exercise and offer ibuprofen but refuse to offer an MRI. He thinks surgery could help him. But they won't talk about it.\n\nCOGER: But yet, they're still making this money every time I see them. And, you know, I'm going on with the same thing that I had 10 years ago.\n\nKODJAK: Georges Benjamin of the Public Health Association says Coger and his doctors don't seem to have the same goal. They're managing his pain. He wants to get back to work.\n\nBENJAMIN: It sounds to me that there's a communication lack there, where either he doesn't understand his course of care or they've not explained a course of care for him. Yeah, it can be very frustrating if you don't really understand what the end goal is for your care.\n\nKODJAK: It's not an uncommon problem. Cheryl Vaun lives in Albany, Ore. and also responded to our poll. She has a low opinion of her health care and the health care in her state. Vaun spent years trying to figure out what was wrong with her daughter. who suddenly fell ill as a teenager. The 16-year-old gained weight, had migraines, and her muscles would seize up. They went from doctor to doctor, lab to lab, repeating the same tests and procedures over and over.\n\nCHERYL VAUN: Certainly over the three-year period, it was draining. And at the end of the three-year period, where you still had no answers, you know, it's just such a terrible feeling of powerlessness, of what do you do now?\n\nKODJAK: Vaun's daughter was finally diagnosed with acute anemia after her heart nearly failed. If the anemia had been caught earlier, Vaun believes it would have been a minor nuisance. Instead, it's become a chronic condition that leaves her daughter tired and weak. Sarah Dash is vice president for policy at the Alliance for Health Reform in Washington. She says repeat tests, multiple doctor visits and lack of results erode people's faith in their care.\n\nSARAH DASH: Health care hasn't always been designed with the needs and the efficiency of the patient in mind. It's designed for the various doctors in the health care system.\n\nKODJAK: And so that's the source of frustration. It's not the effectiveness of the medicine. It's not the MRIs or whether the antibiotic works or whether the surgeons are skillful enough. It's just the system is so complicated and so hard to get around, people get sick of trying to navigate it.\n\nINSKEEP: And just that basic question, is your doctor listening to you? Is your doctor talking to you in a way that you understand? Really, really important.\n\nKODJAK: Yeah, and we had a lot of people say they're really frustrated that doctors are in and out in 15 minutes. They don't really hear what the problem is.\n\nINSKEEP: OK. Now, let's talk about that because that in and out in 15 minutes, that's about the efficiency of the system. That's about doctors being pressed to see a lot of people very, very quickly. We're in the midst of implementing Obamacare, which is about insuring people but also about cutting down costs in the system. Has Obamacare made people's experiences any better or worse the last couple of years?\n\nKODJAK: Well, our poll shows that people think their care hasn't much changed in the last few years. The majority of them say that the law hasn't really affected them directly. They believe that it helps a lot of people. They hear that more people have insurance, but they say that it doesn't really help them specifically.\n\nINSKEEP: Isn't that the political challenge that Obamacare has faced all along? It's designed to insure millions more people, which is very important. But there are many, many millions of others who don't necessarily experience a direct change?\n\nKODJAK: Yeah, it is. And it - one of the problems is that there actually are a lot of additional benefits from Obamacare and people's insurance, but they don't see that directly. You get free mammograms. You get free colonoscopies. You get free birth control. If you had an illness, you can still buy insurance because they can't exclude you for a pre-existing condition. Those aren't apparent to most of the people that we surveyed.\n\nINSKEEP: Each one of those is for a minority of people, in other words.\n\nKODJAK: Exactly.\n\nINSKEEP: Alison, thanks very much.\n\nKODJAK: Thank you, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: Good to talk with you. She is NPR's health policy correspondent. And there's going to be more about this poll online at npr.org. The series continues today on All Things Considered.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

5 Things To Watch As GOP Health Bill Moves To The Senate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images Eric Thayer/Getty Images\n\nAfter weeks of will-they-or-won't-they tensions, the House managed to pass its GOP replacement for the Affordable Care Act on Thursday by a razor-thin margin. The vote was 217-213.\n\nDemocrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. As the Republicans reached a majority for the bill, Democrats on the House floor began chanting, Na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. They say Republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.\n\nNow the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the Capitol to the Senate. And the job doesn't get any easier. With only a two-vote Republican majority and likely no Democratic support, it would take only three GOP no votes to sink the bill.\n\nDemocrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. Trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of Americans and break the bank for millions more, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nIt's The Senate's Turn House passage of the American Health Care Act is just a first step. As this measure moves to the Senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. Among them: MEDICAID: The House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. Some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.\n\nThe House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965.

Others, however, describe these credits as Obamacare Lite.\n\nSome GOP senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. Others, however, describe these credits as Obamacare Lite. PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING: The House would defund this reproductive health organization for a year — a step that draws opposition from a handful of Senate Republicans.\n\nAnd Republicans in the Senate have their own internal disagreements, too.\n\nHere are five of the biggest flashpoints that could make trouble for the bill in the Senate.\n\nMedicaid\n\nHouse leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent House debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nFor the first time, federal funding for low-income people on Medicaid would be limited, resulting in what House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative National Review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. It's a longtime goal for many conservatives. We've been dreaming of this since I've been around, Ryan said.\n\nBut it is not a consensus position in the party. Some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. In addition, many GOP governors took the federal government's offer in the ACA of near-complete federal funding to expand Medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.\n\nThe House bill, wrote the Republican governors of Ohio, Michigan, Arkansas and Nevada in a letter to House and Senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.\n\nThat pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some GOP senators. Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Bill Cassidy, R-La.; and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the House bill, as has Dean Heller, R-Nev., It's not clear whether any of the House changes have satisfied those senators.\n\nIncrease in number of uninsured people\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more Americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many Senate lawmakers. You can't sugarcoat it, Cassidy told Fox News when explaining that it's an awful score. The final House bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.\n\nAnd Democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the House or the Senate to stop the bill or change it.\n\nThe CBO's estimate makes clear that Trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of American families, said Schumer. Tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.\n\nTax credits\n\nOn one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by House leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the Affordable Care Act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. The CBO estimated that under the original version of the House bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.\n\nThat brought a strong rebuke from the powerful AARP, which was an outspoken ACA supporter. Although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has said she could not support the House bill in its original form because of concerns about the effects on older constituents.\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives in the Senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the ACA, with Paul referring to it as Obamacare Lite. They worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.\n\nFor me, it's a big stumbling block still that there's taxpayer money that's being given to insurance companies, Paul told reporters in late April. And I'm just not in favor of taxpayer money going to insurance companies.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nAs Republicans have been vowing for years, the House-passed bill would defund Planned Parenthood, although only for a year. That's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the CBO, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for Medicaid. Birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.\n\nBut while cutting funding for Planned Parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the House, there are a handful of GOP senators, including Collins and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.\n\nProcedural problems\n\nThe budget process Republicans are using to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. It will be up to the Senate parliamentarian, a Republican appointee, to make those determinations.\n\nThat's why the bill does not wipe away all the ACA's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the House amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the Senate's Byrd Rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.\n\nIt could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in a blog post.\n\nEven Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who negotiated that amendment that won the backing of conservatives, conceded that it could prove problematic in the Senate. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done before we can celebrate and all go home, he said in an interview outside the House chamber.\n\nDemocrats say it is one of several provisions in the House bill that might not pass parliamentary muster in the Senate.\n\nFor example, analysts have suggested that the GOP replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass Byrd Rule scrutiny either. That's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.\n\nA third potentially problematic element of the original House bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the Affordable Care Act. That provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.

Who's In, Who's Left Out With The Latest Senate Health Care Bill\n\nThe GOP's latest proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act hews closely to the earlier bill that didn't win enough support among lawmakers to bring to a vote.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change in the document released Thursday is that it leaves in place the Affordable Care Act taxes on wealthy individuals. It uses that money to reduce the number of people left without insurance coverage by the law's changes. This latest version adds $70 billion to a fund for states — bringing the total to $132 billion — to help support coverage of low-income people.\n\nIt also would allow insurance companies to offer health plans without the consumer protections included in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. That means insurers could sell stripped-down policies that cover fewer conditions and offer fewer benefits than currently allowed under the law.\n\nLoading...\n\nThose plans would very likely be cheaper than the policies currently offered on the Obamacare exchanges. But for people who would like to purchase plans that cover the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act, including mental health coverage, addiction treatment, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, costs could go way up.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet analyzed the new bill. It weighed in on the earlier Senate bill, saying that proposal would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage in the next 10 years, compared with under the Affordable Care Act. Of those, 15 million would lose Medicaid coverage. That version was projected to lower the deficit by billions over 10 years — but that may have changed as the latest version offers billions more for state grants and also doesn't repeal as many of the Obamacare taxes.\n\nYet this new variant is the same as its predecessor when it comes to subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. It would mostly reduce subsidies and cause out-of-pocket costs to rise, as the CBO said about the previous bill. It's not yet clear how the state grants would alter that dynamic.
WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Blasts GOP Health Bill, Says It Fails The 'Jimmy Kimmel Test'\n\nYouTube\n\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel thwacked the latest Republican health care proposal Tuesday night after one of the senators sponsoring the bill invoked Kimmel's name.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., touted Tuesday on Capitol Hill that his plan passes the Jimmy Kimmel test.\n\nThat is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in May because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.\n\nI ask, 'Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?'  Cassidy, a medical doctor, said in May of Republican health care proposals. Will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? I want it to pass the 'Jimmy Kimmel test.' \n\nKimmel pressed Cassidy to follow through on his word in a tweet in June and outlined his definition of the Kimmel test, which he reiterated Tuesday night.\n\nBut Kimmel said the latest bill doesn't pass the test. He used his late night platform to knock down Cassidy's health care plan, which the GOP is trying to pass by the end of the month, point by point. He said Cassidy, whom Kimmel quizzed on his show before the plan came out, lied right to my face.\n\nHealth care is complicated; it's boring; I don't want to talk about it, Kimmel said. The details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. They're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. But they're not taking care of you. They're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our Instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. Most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. And they want us to do the same thing. They want us to treat it like an iTunes service agreement. And this guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face.\n\nIn his monologue, Kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. Because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.\n\nSince states decide the rules, according to Cassidy's plan, Kimmel argues that inevitably, there will be states where caps will be instituted and families will be hurt.\n\nKimmel laid out four points that Cassidy had said he wanted in a health care bill:\n\n1. Coverage for all\n\n2. No discrimination based on pre-existing conditions\n\n3. Lower premiums for middle-class families\n\n4. No lifetime caps\n\nI'm sorry he does not understand, Cassidy said Wednesday morning on CNN about Kimmel, adding that under the new bill, more people will have coverage.\n\nThat's almost certainly not true, given the Medicaid expansion rollback that would take place under the bill. Medicaid expansion accounted for the largest drop in the uninsured under the ACA.\n\nWhat's more, Republicans are trying to push the bill through before the Congressional Budget Office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. Prior versions of Republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the ACA.\n\nNot only did he fail the 'Jimmy Kimmel test,'  Kimmel said, it failed the 'Bill Cassidy test.' \n\nAs Kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. Those groans revealed something else — the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the Cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nAnd that raises another important point — in this era in which trust in politicians, Congress, Washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.\n\nThat was true of Jon Stewart when he hosted The Daily Show, and polls began to reveal that his show was a principal news source for many young people.\n\nSo it's not surprising that a popular — formerly fairly apolitical — late night host with a compelling personal storyline to draw on could have a broader effect than other traditional influencers.\n\nI never imagined I would get involved in something like this, Kimmel said. This is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is eating pizza, and that's really about it. But we can't let them do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us.\n\nFor those who say Kimmel has crossed over and become too political. He had a message for them, too: Before you post the nasty Facebook message saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know, I am politicizing my son's health problems, because I have to. But my family has health insurance. We don't have to worry about this, but other people do. So you can shove your disgusting comments where your doctor won't be giving you a prostate exam once they take your health care benefits away.
President-Elect Donald Trump Names Mike Pence To Lead Transition Team\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named his transition committee on Friday, which contains many familiar names from his campaign, from top surrogates, to his children.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said during his trip to Washington, D.C., we can't get started fast enough. He has yet to name any Cabinet members. There's been a lot of speculation. He did announce his transition team yesterday. Those are the people who will help him make those choices. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been covering the Trump campaign and joins us now. Thanks for being with us.\n\nSARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nSIMON: Vice President-elect Pence is going to lead the team. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie apparently has been demoted from that role. Forgive this, but was he just a bridge too far at this point?\n\nMCCAMMON: (Laughter) Nice one there, Scott. Of course, Christie is under a bit of a cloud right now after some of his close aides were recently convicted in that Bridgegate scandal. So he put Pence - and we don't know for sure if this is why, but these events did follow each other. Pence is stepping into the lead, you know, leading the effort to create a cabinet and fill other appointments. We did see some hints of this because Christie himself had said that Trump was not in the initial transition meeting on Wednesday this week, and Pence was there, apparently leading things. Pence, of course, has experience in both Congress and as the governor of Indiana - experience that will likely be useful for Trump, who, of course, has never held a position in government.\n\nSIMON: The three oldest Trump children are on this list of transition team members - Ivanka, Donald, Jr., and Eric. Of course, they also reportedly played a big role in the campaign. Do we know what they'll be doing?\n\nMCCAMMON: You know, Trump has said they will be running his business while he's president, and he's promised it would be in a blind trust. And that's intended to shield him from conflicts of interest. But, of course, these are his children, and it's clear that they're continuing to take an active role in the transition to a Trump administration. We know that they've been in and out of meetings at Trump Tower in New York this week. And it's not clear exactly what their role will be, but federal law prohibits federal employees - and that includes the president - from hiring immediate family members to agencies that they control, which is a lot of agencies if you're the president. And that also would include his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who's played an important role in the campaign and was seen taking a walk this week with White House chief-of-staff Denis McDonough.\n\nSIMON: Lot of names have been - have been batted about this week. Which ones strike you as more solid than just rumors?\n\nMCCAMMON: Well, there are a lot of rumors, among them Steve Bannon, Trump's campaign CEO, and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who are both on the transition team. There has been speculation that one of them might be a candidate for Trump's chief-of-staff. Bannon is, of course, the former head of Breitbart News, and he has said he would go back there. Choosing him, though, would elevate a key figure in the alt-right movement, which has been associated with white nationalism. His website, for instance, has promoted many conspiracy theories that have been debunked. Some of the people leading the committee, also, are names we have heard before during the campaign - Dr. Ben Carson, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich - and Chris Christie is still part of the team. There are also some names that are familiar in Washington and Wall Street - you know, two big establishment cities that Trump has promised supporters he would tear down the establishment during the campaign.\n\nSIMON: And what have we learned about the Trump agenda over the last couple of days?\n\nMCCAMMON: Things seem to be softening a little bit. His advisers have given mixed messages about the wall with Mexico, the ban on Muslim immigration and other issues. And here's what he said on 60 Minutes about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, 60 MINUTES)\n\nLESLEY STAHL: When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Yes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.\n\nSTAHL: You're going to keep that.\n\nTRUMP: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period - we're going to...\n\nSTAHL: You're going to keep that.\n\nTRUMP: We're going to very much try and keep that in. Adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.\n\nMCCAMMON: And here Trump has said, you know, he wanted to make sure that people with preexisting conditions were still covered, but that's one of the costliest parts of the health care law. He didn't say whether he would keep in place the mandate for coverage and that helps balance out the equation for insurers. He did tell The Wall Street Journal that he and President Obama had discussed the law's provisions in their meeting this week. He said he'd consider the president's concerns and that he wasn't sure whether Obamacare would be amended or repealed and replaced. Of course, during the campaign, he promised - repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nMCCAMMON: Thanks.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

Jimmy Kimmel Opens Up About His Newborn Son's Heart Surgery And Praises Obamacare\n\nYouTube\n\nI have a story to tell about something that happened to our family last week. That's how Jimmy Kimmel began an unusually heartfelt monologue on his late-night show Monday.\n\nYou know I try not to get emotional, but it was a scary story, he said, already tearing up. And before I go into it, I want you to know it has a happy ending. OK? So when I'm telling this, don't get too upset. Leave that to me.\n\nIn an emotional, 13-minute recounting of events on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel said that last week, his wife gave birth to a son, William Billy Kimmel, the couple's second child. It was an easy delivery, but a few hours after the birth, a nurse noticed a murmur in the baby's heart. Kimmel describes how they started doing some tests to see whether it might just be fluid in the lungs, potentially a minor thing.\n\nBut the baby's lungs were fine, Kimmel said, which meant his heart wasn't. So now more doctors and nurses and equipment come in. It's — it's a terrifying thing. You know, my wife is back in the recovery room, she has no idea what's going on. And I'm standing in the middle of a lot of very worried-looking people — kind of like right now — who are trying to figure out what the problem is.\n\nDoctors did an echocardiogram and found that Billy was born with a heart defect called tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. It's hard to explain, said Kimmel, but basically the pulmonary valve was completely blocked, and he has a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart.\n\nLast Monday, Kimmel said, a surgeon opened [Billy's] chest and fixed one of the two defects in his heart. He went in there with a scalpel and did some kind of magic that I couldn't even begin to explain. He opened the valve, and the operation was a success. It was the longest three hours of my life. The baby will need to have another heart surgery in three to six months, and another procedure when he's a teenager to replace the valve he has now.\n\nHe thanked a long list of people, including Sylvia, the mother of his bandleader and childhood friend Cleto Escobedo III, who he said was like a second mother to him. Never has any human being ever texted more praying hands emojis to another human being than Cleto's mom did to me. I had to upgrade my phone just to handle them all, he joked.\n\nBut in late night, as elsewhere, the personal is political. Kimmel continued the story of his son's health crisis by discussing the broader context of health care in America.\n\nPresident Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institute[s] of Health, he said. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night not to go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion, and I applaud them for doing that.\n\nHe went on to praise the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, for bringing access to health care to people who couldn't afford it.\n\nWe were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all, he said. You know, before 2014 if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you'd never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition. You were born with a pre-existing condition and if your parents didn't have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition. If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make.\n\nHe finished with a plea for Americans to get past party lines and think of the greater good.\n\nWhatever your party, whatever you believe, whoever you support, we need to make sure that the people who are supposed to represent us, people who are meeting about this right now in Washington, understand that very clearly, Kimmel said.\n\nLet's stop with the nonsense. This isn't football. There are no teams. We are the team. It's the United States. Don't let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants. We need to take care of each other.
Week In Politics: Debriefing The 3rd Democratic Presidential Debate\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nIt finally happened. The top three candidates for the Democratic nomination for president appeared together on stage for the first time. In last night's debate, along with seven other candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden stood before podiums at the historically black college, Texas Southern University.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Our Democratic primary debate starts right now.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: We must and will defeat Trump.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Both Senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare.\n\nSANDERS: Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach.\n\nWARREN: ...Medicare for All. Costs are going to go up.\n\nJOE BIDEN: How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that's happening.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nThe other seven candidates were trying for their own breakout moments, too.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: Bernie wrote the bill. I read the bill. And on Page 8...\n\nANDREW YANG: My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month...\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: It's original. I'll give you that.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: But first, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching.\n\nCORY BOOKER: We know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage...\n\nBETO O'ROURKE: Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\n\n(OOHING)\n\nCASTRO: Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\n\nCHANG: All right, those are just some of the more memorable moments from Houston last night. We're going to talk about all this and much more in our weekly politics chat with two Democratic strategists - Karen Finney, a longtime senior adviser to Hillary Clinton and director of communications for the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009. Heather McGhee is a distinguished senior fellow at Demos Action, a progressive advocacy group. She was also an adviser to Senator John Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nWelcome to both of you.\n\nKAREN FINNEY: Good to be with you.\n\nHEATHER MCGHEE: Glad to be here.\n\nCHANG: OK, Let's start with probably the most divisive topic last night - health care. How much did last night's tussle between, say, Sanders and Warren on the Medicare-for-All side and Biden on the Obamacare side - how much did last night move the health care conversation forward for you, Heather?\n\nMCGHEE: You know, I think every time Democrats talk about health care, they're winning, right? They're comparing themselves to the Republicans who want to take away the protections for preexisting conditions, who want to kill Obamacare altogether. And it remains the most popular and important and pressing issue for American voters.\n\nThat said, there's a lot of education still to be done because health care is very complicated. And so that's where when someone like Elizabeth Warren, who's just a real master communicator on policy, where she comes in and she explains the for-profit health care system by saying, basically, they profit when they say no to you. That's really helpful. It helps put the whole idea of a government single-payer plan in context. And so I do think the debates are important for giving opportunities for what's not just a Democratic primary audience but a general election audience who's also watching the basic facts about what is health care, who pays for it, what it costs.\n\nFINNEY: But I think what's missing in that...\n\nCHANG: Yeah.\n\nFINNEY: ...And what I think they were trying to get to and I hope we get to at some point in one of these debates is most people that I talk to in different focus groups, they want to understand, OK, what does that mean for me? What's - so tomorrow morning, I get up in this new system. What happens? Do I get to see my same doctor? Is it a different doctor? Does it cost me more? Does it cost me less? Where do I go? And so I do worry that as we're talking so much about the system, I think there is still a portion - there's a lot of people in the electorate who are not quite sure, what does that mean for me? And that's the part that scares people, which is part of why I think Kamala actually changed her plan to try to respond to what she was hearing from people, which is, what's that transition going to look like?\n\nCHANG: I want to get to that question - what does that mean for me? - because there was this moment in the debate last night where Warren was directly asked, will Medicare for All raise taxes for the middle class?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nWARREN: Look; what families have to deal with is cost - total cost.\n\nCHANG: OK, again, that was from ABC News. So we never actually hear Warren say yes or no to the question, will this raise taxes? She answers by talking about overall costs, about how overall health care costs will go down for people. But is that argument going to work with regular voters, people who just want to know if their taxes will go up, Karen?\n\nFINNEY: Well, maybe. I mean, you know, you never want to say you're going to raise taxes, right? Politicians on all sides know that. And I think the argument that both she and Bernie are trying to make is that your costs overall will end up sort of balancing out because you might pay a little more in taxes, but you'll be paying less in your health care costs. I think at some point, we're going to have to have that conversation, as I say. And people are going to want to understand that level of detail.\n\nAt the same time, look; I think the other thing that they keep going to last night that was so important is these are details that are, you know, minuscule in comparison to Donald Trump trying to take away your health care, trying to raise your costs. So I think that's part of why you saw them still feeling like we don't have to totally get in the weeds because the bigger picture is still where they really want the electorate to focus.\n\nCHANG: Yeah. Heather?\n\nMCGHEE: I agree. I think that, you know, frankly, the American people are paying lots of different people a lot of money for their health care and still not getting the results that they want. And so it is true that people think about, how much, you know, money do I have left at the end of my paycheck? And so I think it makes sense for the Warren, you know, Sanders wing to talk about it in terms of overall cost.\n\nCHANG: Yeah.\n\nMCGHEE: Are you paying a for-profit company, or are you paying, you know, the government yourselves, you know, your community? But I also think that, as Karen said, this health care conversation is one where there still needs to be a lot more education, which makes sense, right? The idea of Medicare for All, although, you know, millions of Americans are already on Medicare and already love Medicare, the idea of transitioning our entire system is a new one. There are pieces of it that are enormously popular already, but they also need more education and more airing.\n\nCHANG: OK.\n\nMCGHEE: And then again, you know, it's all better than kicking 26-year-olds off of their...\n\nCHANG: Yeah.\n\nMCGHEE: ...Health care, which is what the Republicans want to do.\n\nCHANG: Well, beyond health care - we have just about one minute left. We invited the two of you to this week's chat because you represent different parts of the Democratic Party. We're hearing so much about the progressive-moderate split among the Democratic contenders. Where else beyond health care did you see that split last night? Karen, let's start with you.\n\nFINNEY: I think, in part, the economy, just writ large, sort of the economic vision. You know, Biden had his line in there - it was referring to health care - about Bernie is a socialist, trusting corporations. And I'll be honest. I think when we talk about the understanding of things like systemic racism, obviously, we didn't hear enough about - we didn't hear anything about women and choice. But - so those are some of the issues where I don't - I think we could have heard more, frankly. And I think we heard some differences, mostly in people's adeptness at being able to talk about the nuances.\n\nCHANG: What about you, Heather?\n\nMCGHEE: Yeah, I think that Biden's moment, which is sort of being seen as the record player moment, was actually a really much more damning moment if you go back and look at the transcript.\n\nCHANG: This is when he was asked about reparations.\n\nMCGHEE: He was asked, what can Americans do, what responsibility...\n\nCHANG: And we have about 10 seconds left. I'm so sorry.\n\nMCGHEE: No problem. But basically, he went and ended up sort of blaming, you know, implicitly black families for not doing enough to educate their children at home...\n\nCHANG: All right.\n\nMCGHEE: ...And talk to them enough at home. It was a terrible moment for him.\n\nCHANG: Democratic strategists Karen Finney and Heather McGhee, thanks to both of you.\n\nMCGHEE: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Who Is Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's Pick For The Supreme Court?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump has chosen Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit — often thought of as the second-most-powerful court in the country — to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.\n\nKavanaugh is a connected Washington insider with roots in politics in the George W. Bush White House. He has written almost 300 opinions for the D.C. Circuit in 12 years — and he is only 53, which means he could serve on the high court for a very long time.\n\nSome conservatives, though, question his bona fides, and he is controversial with Democrats because of his role investigating President Bill Clinton as part of the Starr investigation in the 1990s. And he now believes that a sitting president should be protected from litigation and criminal investigations because they are time-consuming and distracting.\n\nNotably, in an era of hotly partisan politics, Kavanaugh has said that it's important not to be a partisan when one becomes a judge. Check those political allegiances at the door when you become a judge, Kavanaugh said in 2015 in a speech at Catholic University's law school.\n\nHe also spoke at length about the necessity of humility. Part of being a good judge, he said, is Don't be a jerk.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nName: Brett M. Kavanaugh\n\nAge: 53 (born Feb. 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.)\n\nCourt: D.C. Circuit\n\nAppointed by: President George W. Bush, 2006\n\nEducation: Yale Law School, 1990; bachelor of arts, Yale College, 1987\n\nFamily: Wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, and two daughters, Margaret and Elizabeth\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nSupreme Court connection: He clerked for Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.\n\nRoots in politics: Kavanaugh was a member of Lawyers for Bush-Cheney during the 2000 campaign and was a regional coordinator for the campaign. He also participated in the Florida recount and served as a White House counsel to George W. Bush and then staff secretary until 2006, when Bush appointed him to his current position on the federal bench. (He was originally appointed in 2003, but Democrats argued he was too partisan and his nomination was held up for three years.) No one else on the president's current list can rival Kavanaugh for Washington credentials, SCOTUSBlog notes.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWorked on The Starr Report: He was part of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's team during the investigation of then-President Bill Clinton, specifically assigned to investigate Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster's suicide. The Baltimore Sun notes that he argued unsuccessfully before the Supreme Court that attorney-client privilege did not apply to Foster after his death by suicide.\n\nBelieves presidents should be protected from lawsuits and criminal investigations: The Starr Report to Congress outlined information that potentially constituted grounds for the impeachment of President Clinton, as the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary notes. And yet, Kavanaugh wrote this in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review about presidential investigations, which is sure to please President Trump:\n\nEven the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the President's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\n\nHe's young: His age is an advantage. At 53, he is relatively young, and Trump has said he wants a nominee who could serve on the high court for decades. At age 41, he was the youngest federal circuit judge at the time of his appointment.\n\nHe fires up the opposition: In 2004, Sen. Chuck Schumer said of Kavanaugh before his confirmation hearings for the D.C. Circuit: Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the D.C. Circuit is not just a drop of salt in the partisan wounds, it is the whole shaker.\n\nCriticized consumer protection agency: In addition to his writing that a president shouldn't be subjected to litigation or criminal investigation while in office, NPR's Uri Berliner reports, Kavanaugh wrote another opinion that will get a lot of attention. It involves the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and, in it, Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB's structure is unconstitutional, because it is run by a single, unaccountable director — unlike other agencies like the SEC or FCC that have multiple commissioners.\n\nWriting for a three-judge panel in 2016, he argued that the watchdog agency, created under the guidance of Sen. Elizabeth Warren after the financial crisis, placed excessive power in the hands of an agency with no congressional oversight and funded by the Federal Reserve. Kavanaugh wrote:\n\nThe director of the CFPB possesses more unilateral authority — that is, authority to take action on one's own, subject to no check — than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.S. government.\n\nAnd he contended that the creation of the CFPB is a gross departure from settled historical practice. Consumer groups and Democrats slammed Kavanaugh's opinion as a politically motivated gift to financial companies. And they were relieved in January when a federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of the CFPB. But the agency's legal structure is still being litigated. Kavanaugh's blistering attack most likely reflects his broader wariness about the power of the administrative state. And it probably offers insight into how he views financial regulation.\n\nSome conservatives don't like him: There is some grousing in some conservative circles over Kavanaugh. These conservatives, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, believe he is not sufficiently conservative. They disagree with portions of opinions he has written relating to abortion and the Affordable Care Act, for example.\n\nIn one opinion, they argue, he laid the groundwork for upholding the Affordable Care Act as constitutional because he recognized the mandate as a tax. (A law professor from the University of Louisville defended Kavanaugh to conservatives, writing at The Federalist under the headline Brett Kavanaugh Said Obamacare Was Unprecedented And Unlawful.)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nHis critics don't like a piece of another opinion he wrote having to do with an immigrant teenager who wanted to get an abortion. Even though he agreed with the minority that she should not be allowed to have the procedure, he did so for not as hard-line a reason as another judge.\n\nHis critics have also been circulating an opposition research document trying to tie Kavanaugh to Alex Kozinski, the former federal judge who was accused by several former clerks of sexual harassment. Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski from 1990 to 1991 and is not himself accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nWhat's more, these critics don't trust him because he has been part of the establishment; he is a Bushie who grew up in the D.C. suburbs. They believe he is exactly the kind of potential nominee who has disappointed conservatives before.\n\nPragmatic, but conservative: Overall, however, based on some 300 opinions in 12 years on the federal bench, Kavanaugh is considered a pragmatic but conservative judge, who believes in textualism and originalism. He also often weighed in against President Barack Obama's Environmental Protection Agency, including, notably in one case — in which he was in the minority — that said the EPA should have considered costs to power plants. SCOTUSBlog notes that his argument was a signal to late Justice Antonin Scalia to take the case. The Supreme Court did, and reversed the D.C. Circuit's opinion, quoting Kavanaugh's dissent.\n\nA textualist: Kavanaugh has expressed some admiration of late Justice Antonin Scalia and the necessity of textualism, interpreting law based first on the language in a statute. Kavanaugh said in 2015 that it's important to stick to the established text. Of Scalia, he said, he's narrowed the areas of disagreement about how to interpret statutes.\n\nDon't be a jerk: During a speech at Catholic University's law school in 2015, a speech lots of people will be combing through, Kavanaugh spoke a lot about humility (and used a lot of sports metaphors likening judges to referees and umpires and the necessity of being consistent).\n\nTo be a good judge and a good umpire, he said, it's important to have the proper demeanor, really important, I think, to walk in the other's shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the litigants in the case, the other judges, to understand them, to keep our emotions in check, to be calm amidst the storm.\n\nOn the bench, to put it in the vernacular, don't be a jerk. I think that's important. To be a good umpire and a good judge, don't be a jerk. And in your opinions, to demonstrate civility; I think that's important as well. To show, to help display that you're trying to make a decision impartially and dispassionately, based on the law and not based on your emotions.\n\nYouTube\n\nHe added, We can't act like we're bigger than the game. There's a danger for arrogance, for umpires, for referees, but also for judges. And I would say that danger grows the more time you are on the bench. As one of my colleagues puts it, 'You become more like yourself.' And that can be a problem.\n\nA believer in precedent: This could be another thing that upsets the conservative base. In his speech, he also endorsed stare decisis, the practice of following precedent. We follow precedent, he said. He added that to be a good judge, one has to follow not just the letter but also the spirit of the law.\n\nLove the guy, he said of George W. Bush: Some conservatives have said one of the reasons they don't trust Kavanaugh is his closeness to Washington, D.C., politics and former President George W. Bush. At this year's Catholic University law school commencement address, he noted what a fan he is of the former president, as highlighted by the National Law Journal:\n\nBe optimistic, see the day coming, not the day that has gone. This was a favorite saying of George W. Bush's. I worked for him for five-and-a-half years. Love the guy. At graduations, he would say, 'For those of you who've won honors, awards and distinctions, well done. And for the C students, you too can be president of the United States.' President Bush lives on the sunrise side of the mountain. That's the place to live. Be the optimist, the happy warrior. Do not get beaten down.\n\nYouTube\n\nPersonal notes:\n\n— He grew up in Bethesda, Md., in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. His mother was a public school teacher who went on to become a prosecutor and judge in Maryland.\n\n— He met his wife, Ashley Estes, when she was personal secretary to President George W. Bush while Kavanaugh was also working in the White House. Currently, she is Chevy Chase Village (Md.) Section 5 town manager.\n\n— Kavanaugh is a past president of the exclusive Edward Coke (pronounced Cook) Appellate Inn of Court. The group is based in Washington and its members meet regularly during the Supreme Court term to socialize and discuss matters of appellate and Supreme Court practice, according to its website. To become a member, one has to be actively engaged in appellate practice and be nominated by a current member. You get only a three-year term, can be nominated for more or elevated to a Barrister, but, as the group says, Elevation is not automatic and should not be presumed.\n\n— If confirmed, he would help to even the educational balance on the high court, which is currently five Harvard (John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Ruth Bader Ginsburg — although Ginsburg finished at Columbia) and three Yale (Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor).\n\n— He is active in his community. He serves as a lector and usher at Blessed Sacrament Church in Washington, D.C. He also coached the fourth- through sixth-grade girls basketball teams at Blessed Sacrament, as well as a Montgomery County Recreation girls basketball team and the Classics AAU second grade girls basketball team.\n\n— He is friends with the president of the Arizona Cardinals, Michael Bidwell, who was a classmate at Georgetown Prep.\n\n— He noted that he was hired at Harvard Law School by Kagan, who was appointed to the high court by Obama.\n\nQuotable: Even though he has Ivy League credentials and a fancy job, he's kind of a regular, all-American guy. He likes to play basketball and drink beer. ... It's very refreshing in a town like Washington. — Helgi Walker, who worked with Kavanaugh in the White House counsel's office, to the Washington Post.\n\nFinancial disclosure notes:\n\n— Judges' financial disclosure does not appear to require listing all assets. It does include listing investments and trusts. For his most recent disclosure, those total between $15,001 and $65,000 (Bank of America accounts, $15,001 to $50,000; Employee Retirement System of Texas, $15,000 or less). His 2011 disclosure, though, lists a Bank of America account that was valued between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\n— His liabilities total between $15,001 and $95,000 (Chase credit card $15,000 or less; Thrift Savings Plan loan between $15,001 and $50,000; Bank of America credit card $15,000 or less).\n\n— He lists being a lecturer at Harvard Law (for which he was paid $27,220), the director of the D.C. Circuit Historical Society and an adviser to the American Law Institute.\n\n— His 2006 to 2009 disclosures lists his spouse as taking a salary from the George W. Bush Library Foundation as administrative staff.
Republicans Blast 'Hypocrisy' Of Democrats Calling Barrett Hearings Political\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans already have all but won the battle to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court thanks to their control of the Senate, but used Monday's confirmation hearing to stress the importance of a judiciary free from political interference and to defend Barrett against attacks on her religion, even as Democrats avoided the topic.\n\nSo, freed from the need to make a case for the nominee — although several senators are — Republicans are using the opportunity for broader comments about what they call the strength of the judicial system at which Barrett is poised to sit at the apogee.\n\nThis idea of place in our system of government is critical. Ours is a government of separated powers. The power to make, enforce, and interpret the law isn't centralized in one person or one branch of government, said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a top member of the panel.\n\nBut this system only succeeds if each branch respects its role. A good judge understands it's not the court's place to rewrite the law as it sees fit. It's not his or her place to let policy, personal or moral principles dictate an outcome.\n\nSeveral Republicans have reacted with wry or sarcastic disappointment at the complaints and objections of minority Democrats, whom they argue would be acting exactly in the same way as they are if they held the majority and Republicans were in their place.\n\nThe objections about the Affordable Care Act have nothing to do with Barrett or the Supreme Court, Republicans argue — and it's impossible to accept the premise that a judge must be impartial but also ask her to agree to take a certain position before she is confirmed, they said.\n\nThe hypocrisy is incredible, said Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats have been pointing to a case related to the ACA that is set to go before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10, which a newly appointed justice could weigh in on. In a 2017 article in the Notre Dame law journal, Barrett pushed back against the court's ruling on Obamacare.\n\nSome of the fiercest counterattacks on Barrett's behalf came from Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who each, in their turn, faulted what they called the attempt by critics to impose a religious test for the Supreme Court.\n\nHawley cited what he called inappropriate questioning about Barrett's Catholic beliefs and affiliation and said it was nothing less than bigotry, a bid by opponents to bar Barrett from public office based on her religious identity — which is protected under the Constitution.\n\nSasse agreed and lamented what he called the absorption of civics by politics, which he said has brought Washington to the point where parties' need to win has subsumed a prior consensus about the rules and expectations of governance.\n\nWhile Barrett's faith came up in her confirmation hearing for her federal judgeship, Democrats steered clear of the topic on Monday.\n\nSasse said he hopes Washington and Americans more broadly can recover what he called the importance of civics, which would lower the temperature on disputes like that over Barrett's nomination.\n\nPolitics is like if I look at my friend [Delaware's Democratic Sen.] Chris Coons and I say, 'Listen up, jackwagon, what you want to do on this particular Finance Committee bill is going to be way too expensive and might bankrupt our kids.' Or if Chris looks back at me and says, 'Listen up, jackwagon, you're too much of a cheapskate and you're underinvesting in the next generation.' That's a really important debate. That's a political debate. That's not civics. Civics is more important than that. Civics doesn't change every 18-24 months because the electoral winds change and because polling changes.
Maine Approves Medicaid Expansion; Referendums In New York, Ohio Fail\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nUpdated at 6:50 a.m. ET\n\nVoters in Maine have easily approved a referendum to expand Medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed the move — a key element of Obamacare.\n\nMaine is one of a handful of states deciding major issues by referendum on Tuesday, including New York and Ohio.\n\nMaine's Question 2 passed by about 60 percent. The measure is seen as a bellwether for continuing support of the Affordable Care Act, even as Republicans have tried repeatedly to unravel the Obama administration's signature health care bill.\n\nThe vote would bring Maine, which has been hit hard by the heroin epidemic, in line with 31 other states that have expanded their state programs. An estimated 80,000 Maine residents will qualify.\n\nIt is the first time such an expansion has been mandated by referendum, and as NPR's Brett Neely has written, it could energize organizers of similar campaigns for 2018 across the country, including in Utah and Alaska.\n\nPolitico adds that voters hope to bypass state legislators hostile to the Obamacare program that sank past efforts. That dynamic has also squashed Medicaid expansion efforts in Tennessee, Wyoming and South Dakota, where GOP governors tried and failed to get legislative backing for expansion plans. In Kansas, the GOP-controlled legislature passed legislation earlier this year only to see it vetoed by Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reports that turnout in Maine was higher than expected at the polls, with voters driven primarily by the Medicaid expansion measure, although the newspaper reports that voters statewide were [also] considering referendums on a casino in York County, a $102 million transportation bond and a constitutional amendment dealing with changes to state employee pensions.\n\nMeanwhile, voters in New York rejected a measure calling for a constitutional convention on the state's founding document. With most of the state's precincts reporting, the measure was easily defeated.\n\nThe New York Times reports: The campaign against the constitutional convention drew a diverse collection of opponents, including conservative political groups, major labor groups like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and liberal stalwarts like the New York branch of Planned Parenthood and the New York Civil Liberties Union. And while their concerns were often different, the basic logic of the anticonvention forces was similar: Such a convention could result in an erosion of protections for everything from collective bargaining rights to free public education.\n\nIn Ohio, a measure to limit the price on prescription drugs purchased by the state, which was strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, was defeated. The referendum called for capping what the state pays for pharmaceuticals to the same price paid by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs for the same drugs.\n\nThe no vote was about 80 percent.\n\nCleveland.com writes: The proponents hoped to bank on the unpopularity of the drug companies in Ohio as well as ill will toward them in general after recent price gouging controversies. The opposition backed by Big Pharma had nearly unlimited resources, outspending the Yes side by three-to-one over the course of the campaign.
How Is President Trump Doing? 2 Trump Voters Weigh In\n\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro checks in with two Trump supporters on the how the president is doing. Kevin Eisbrenner is from Michigan and Rena Tolson is from Maryland.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump says he may pick a nominee for FBI director before he goes overseas on Friday, while the investigation into Russian election interference gets hotter and the fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act continues and the effort to revamp the tax code grinds on. Let's check in now with some people who voted for Donald Trump. How's he doing? And how would they like to see these battles play out? Kevin Eisbrenner joins us now from Livonia, Mich.\n\nHi.\n\nKEVIN EISBRENNER: Hello.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And Rena Tolson is from Columbia, Md., and she's here in the studios with us.\n\nGood morning.\n\nRENA TOLSON: Good morning.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, let's start with this week's banner headline story. How do you think the president handled the firing of James Comey? Rena, let's start with you.\n\nTOLSON: I think he handled it pretty well. It seemed pretty diplomatic and step by step, following a process that seemed to already be in place.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. Kevin, do you think he did the right thing?\n\nEISBRENNER: As far as firing Comey, yeah. I'd say that was the right thing to do. That's his prerogative. You know, they keep trying to tie it to this Russian collusion.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: The investigation that's going on right now in the FBI, in the Senate...\n\nEISBRENNER: Right.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: ...And in the House.\n\nEISBRENNER: You know, the investigation really starts out with Flynn because he could have been compromised as national security adviser, yes. Look - they've got to definitely look into that. Now, feel free to look into the collusion part, too, but I doubt very much they're going to find anything that affected the election. So - but, hey, if they want to - if the FBI wants to investigate it, go right ahead, you know. I have no problem with that.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Investigations do take time. Rena, speaking of Russia, you've just heard Kevin's opinion there. I'm curious to know what you think about the investigation.\n\nTOLSON: Sure. And I think, like Kevin said, everything is subject to investigation. But I think to say that the Trump campaign was in collusion and the campaign was part of this, that's way out there. That's really (laughter) way out there.\n\nEISBRENNER: Yeah.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you...\n\nEISBRENNER: And as a side note...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah.\n\nEISBRENNER: ...I really think that if Putin was interested in interfering in Washington, then Ovechkin and the Capitals would have had a different outcome in Game 7 against the Penguins, you know. How well does he know Putin? I don't know. I didn't see any interference there.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, let's talk about the things that the president promised on the campaign trail - building the border wall, affordable health care, bringing back jobs. There's a lot there, but I'd like to know where you think he's done well and where you'd still like to see him do more. Let's start with you, Rena.\n\nTOLSON: Well, I think he's done well for jobs. Obviously, the statistics out there are showing that jobs are on the rise. I think the border wall - he's getting a lot of opposition there. But I think his stance on trying to move forward with illegal people coming into the country - we see that those statistics are down, so I think he's making progress there. So I think that those two things are definitely part of what he's wanting to move forward. And that seems to be getting support in moving forward.\n\nI think that health care is just a mess, and he's obviously trying to move something forward on that. And I think that everyone needs to be behind the president and working together to get this taken care of for the people. Whether it's eradicating Obamacare or making something new, the people are suffering, and we need to be united and be behind the president to help the people. And so I think he's really trying to move that forward. So I'd give him a lot of progress points on that.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, Kevin, do you think that the GOP health care bill, as passed, really does the best for the majority of Americans?\n\nEISBRENNER: You know, I think it's a slight improvement. I don't think it's the answer, though. I really don't. I don't think it's going to help everybody across the board - no. And that's why my belief is keep the government out of health care. The government, really, anything they get involved in, for the most part, in my opinion, they don't do a good job at it. You know, my daughter had to go get an Obamacare policy, and it saved her bacon, you know, with some things going on. She got a policy. But then, for every story of my daughter, there's 50 where people went the opposite way. It really screwed them over.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So just let me clarify this - your daughter was helped by a policy under the Obamacare legislation?\n\nEISBRENNER: Right. She was in between jobs, and instead of having to pay the penalty, she figured she could put those dollars to use and get herself a policy. You know, it helped her out in that situation. You know, for somebody in her age bracket, in her situation, it worked.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: OK, Rena, just one more question on health care - I'd like to bring it back to President Trump. Do you think he has a clear vision for what health care reform entails?\n\nTOLSON: I think as a business person, he has a clear vision in terms of the final outcome. I don't know necessarily if the first round is the best solution, but something has to be done. And Obamacare, great in its idea - maybe President Obama had a vision as well, but we didn't get there.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Kevin, I'm going to ask you a different question. The president has given a lot of interviews this week, and in many, he's contradicted himself. In one with The Economist, he claimed to have invented an economic term that was coined in the 19th century. Many of his critics say - and even in The Economist article it said - that he's erratic and that he lacks knowledge. Does that worry you when you look at his words and they don't necessarily match up with other statements that he's given at different times?\n\nEISBRENNER: You know, that's one - that's why, you know - they say how do you grade him on 1 to 10? And I say maybe 7.5. That's one of the little things there that - you know, that and his Twitter, I wish he would stop a little bit of that, you know, the reactionary part and, you know, talk to his advisers because sometimes just shooting from the hip, you end up shooting yourself in the foot.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And you?\n\nTOLSON: I think that there's a overanalysis (laughter) of all of that and that he...\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: You think this is all inside-the-Beltway obsession. It's just the journalists and the pundits talking to each other and the...\n\nTOLSON: If you really talk to people outside of all of it, they really don't care, and they're turning it off. And what they really care about is the big-picture things and how it affects them, you know, how it affects their day to day. And we're all caught up in - is he contradicting himself? Look, we contradict ourselves every day. We say one thing. We do another. The next day comes, and we feel differently about it. And I understand that we put the president in this position where he has to be perfect or be consistent. I understand that. But at some level, we need to be a little bit more gracious.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, Kevin Eisbrenner and Rena Tolson, thanks so much for coming in.\n\nEISBRENNER: Well, thank you.\n\nTOLSON: You're welcome. Thanks for having us.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

8 Key Moments That Helped Define Bernie Sanders' Presidential Runs\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign Wednesday.\n\nThough the 78-year-old did not emerge as the Democratic nominee in either of his two presidential bids, his campaigns have reshaped the party's politics and policy in significant ways. Here's a look back at several key moments from the past five years:\n\n1. Sanders Announces His 1st Presidential Bid\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThe key thing about this moment is that when it happened, it didn't feel key at all.\n\nIn April 2015, most Democrats saw former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the party's inevitable 2016 nominee. President Obama was urging Vice President Joe Biden not to mount a bid, and many other prominent Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, decided not to run either.\n\nEnter Sanders, who wasn't even a Democrat, and who had spent most of his two-decade career in Washington, D.C., as more of a backbench gadfly than anything else. Sanders had begun to emerge as a national figure several years before, when he protested a bipartisan tax deal with an eight-hour filibuster.\n\nMost campaigns launch with a big rally in the candidate's home state. Not this one. Sanders walked outside the Senate, held a 10-minute news conference with a scrum of reporters, and went back to work. The first words of his political revolution? We don't have an endless amount of time. I've got to get back.\n\n2. Crowds Start To Grow\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nBut as spring 2015 turned into summer, it became clear that Sanders' anti-establishment, anti-billionaire message was taking off. Crowds grew and grew, including a rally in Madison, Wis., that drew more than 10,000 people.\n\nClinton was not drawing crowds anywhere near that size, even as she maintained wide polling leads over Sanders and often tried to ignore his candidacy.\n\nSanders tapped into a seemingly bottomless pit of small-dollar online donations from supporters, and grew his campaign into a national organization.\n\nIn early 2016, he shocked the political world by essentially tying Clinton in Iowa, then he blew her out by 22 percentage points in New Hampshire.\n\nFour years later, Sanders pinpointed the New Hampshire victory as the moment when his agenda of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free public college went from too radical, too extreme, to something viewed by many voters as a viable, appealing platform.\n\n3. An Uneasy Truce\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Saglio/AFP via Getty Images Justin Saglio/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSanders scored more wins — most notably in Michigan and Wisconsin that provided (overlooked) warning signs about Clinton's strength in those two key swing states.\n\nBut over the course of spring 2016, Clinton steadily grew her delegate lead over Sanders, winning key blowout victories in southern states with lots of African-American voters. Sanders refused to drop out, and campaigned through June. Even after Clinton clinched the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, Sanders still didn't concede until shortly before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nLess than two weeks later, WikiLeaks released a trove of hacked and stolen emails revealing that several Democratic National Committee staffers had a clear preference for Clinton over Sanders. Angry Sanders supporters marched through the streets in Philadelphia, and disrupted the first day of the party's convention.\n\nThough Sanders campaigned with and for Clinton into the fall, many Clinton backers blamed Sanders' perceived apathy toward Clinton as a reason why she narrowly lost to Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Clinton-Sanders rift would never fully heal, and indeed resurfaced several times when he ran again four years later.\n\n4. Democratic Policy Leader\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nSanders came out of 2016 as a national leader in the party he still hadn't joined. Top Democrats embraced him and sought his validation — even when it was awkward.\n\nSanders campaigned across the country against President Trump and congressional Republicans' push to repeal Obamacare, and then he reintroduced his signature Medicare-for-all health care plan.\n\nLook, I have no illusions that under a Republican Senate and a very right-wing House and an extremely right-wing president of the United States that suddenly we're going to see a Medicare-for-all, single-payer passed, Sanders told NPR at the time. You're not going to see it. That's obvious.\n\nBut the bill did have a significant impact on the Democratic presidential primary that was still two years away. Future fellow candidates like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand all rushed to cosponsor the legislation.\n\nThey would all later face a political balancing act of embracing the measure but also, to varying degrees, distancing themselves from two of its core goals: completely eliminating the private health insurance industry, and increasing taxes to pay for coverage. Both Warren and Harris, especially, ended up twisting themselves in political and policy knots, as Sanders unapologetically campaigned for a platform he conceded would raise taxes (but lower health costs overall, he said).\n\nMedicare-for-all would end up as one of the defining issues of the 2020 primary, surfacing in numerous debates. Even opponents of the effort, like former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, framed their own health care proposals on Sanders' terms.\n\n5. Hard Stories At Health Care Town Halls\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSanders entered the 2020 presidential campaign as a favorite, not an afterthought.\n\nStill, his campaign faced a lot of uncertainties. Most notably: How many progressives who backed Sanders in the two-candidate 2016 contest would migrate to Warren or any of the other two dozen Democrats who entered the race?\n\nBernie 2020 looked very different than Bernie 2016 in several ways. Among them: a deliberate effort to do fewer mega-rallies — at least in the early months of the race — and instead focus on more intimate town halls where people in the audience shared their struggles with health care access and costs.\n\nIn September, a man in Carson City, Nev., told Sanders he was considering suicide because of six-figure medical debt. Campaign staffers credited these intense moments — always livestreamed and repackaged on social media by the campaign — as validating and amplifying Sanders' push to overhaul the American health care system.\n\n6. AOC Helps Bernie Bounce Back\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images\n\nStill, Sanders spent most of 2019 in Warren's shadow. It was Warren, not Sanders, who was steadily rising in the polls and seemingly consolidating the progressive wing of the party.\n\nOn Oct. 1, Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. In the days following the incident, as the campaign slowly released more details about what had actually happened, there were real questions about whether Sanders could continue campaigning. He was off the trail for about two weeks.\n\nThen, at the very end of a televised debate, Sanders' campaign announced a major endorsement: progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That weekend, she and Sanders rallied in front of more than 20,000 people in New York City. Suddenly Sanders had life again — his campaign contributions shot up, his poll numbers rose, and it was Warren, not Sanders, who was facing questions about viability.\n\nSanders gained more and more momentum in November, December and January. He won New Hampshire and Nevada, while essentially tying Buttigieg atop the muddled Iowa caucuses.\n\nSanders suddenly was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n7. Moderates Unite\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP\n\nBiden won South Carolina big, but Sanders kept his focus on Super Tuesday. All along, his campaign's plan was to build up a massive delegate lead that day in states like California and Texas, and never look back. Sanders campaigned across the country at a frantic pace, holding massive rallies in Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas and elsewhere.\n\nThen, on a day in which Sanders flew from Utah to Minnesota to Vermont, everything changed. Buttigieg, who had dropped out the night before, endorsed Biden. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar did the same. So did former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who had ended his campaign months earlier.\n\nThe race suddenly went from Sanders narrowly having the largest base in a crowded field to essentially a two-candidate race. And Biden, who had appeared on the brink of a humiliating defeat just a few days before, cleaned up.\n\nBiden won 10 of 14 states on March 3, then five of six the next week, including a romp in Michigan, a state at the heart of Sanders' 2016 success.\n\nThe next day, Sanders vowed to stay in the race, but conceded that, While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability.\n\n8. The Pandemic Freezes The Race\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bernie Sanders for President/AP Bernie Sanders for President/AP\n\nBut Sanders would not hold another campaign rally in the 2020 race. On March 10, Sanders abruptly cancelled a Cleveland rally due to mounting coronavirus concerns. Soon, even the news conferences and speeches that Sanders and Biden started holding instead were seen as dangerous. The primary was suddenly frozen in place.\n\nNeither Sanders nor Biden campaigned in person in the week leading up to primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, and Biden won all three states.\n\nSoon, state after state postponed their primaries, and Sanders didn't have any chances to gain ground on Biden, whose delegate lead had grown to more than 300.\n\nThe Sanders campaign said it would assess its path forward, and Sanders instead focused all his efforts on the federal coronavirus response. He held virtual roundtables on the virus, arguing the global pandemic validated his call for a national government-run health care system, as well as massive federal spending to help the out-of-work and struggling.\n\nThis week, Sanders abruptly ended his campaign. I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour, he said via livestream.\n\nIn 2018, Sanders told NPR that he didn't especially care whether the progressive candidates he was endorsing were winning their primaries. The point, he said, was to push the policies and the platforms more and more into the mainstream. I hope they win, he said in his Senate office. Maybe they don't. But if you get 45% of the vote now, next time you may well win. You have to start somewhere.\n\nSanders will not win the presidency this year. But whether it's next year or at some point in the future, the next Democratic president will very likely try to pass a substantial part of the agenda Sanders has pushed for over the past five years.
Susan Collins Of Maine Announces She Will Seek Reelection\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nSen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is one of the few members of her party willing to buck President Trump, announced Wednesday she would seek reelection. Her announcement comes the same day the U.S. House of Representatives began debate on impeaching the president.\n\nThe fundamental question I had to ask myself in making my decision was this: In today's polarized political environment, is there still a role for a centrist who believes in getting things done through compromise, collegiality, and bipartisanship? Collins said in an email to reporters. I have concluded that the answer to this question is 'yes' and I will, therefore, seek the honor of continuing to serve as Maine's United States senator.\n\nThe news that Collins, 67, will launch a bid for a fifth term came a day after she told NPR that she was undecided on whether to convict Trump in a potential Senate trial, which could start as soon as next month, over his conduct with Ukraine.\n\nI have not made up my mind, Collins, one of 100 U.S. senators who would serve as jurors in the president's Senate trial, told NPR. And I think it would be inappropriate for me to have made up my mind before I hear the presentations from both sides.\n\nCollins could face a tough reelection. Americans remain deeply divided over impeachment and a host of other hot-button political issues. Although Collins has carried her state's tradition of political independence in the Senate, she has been assailed by her constituents in Maine for her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite her self-identification as an abortion-rights supporter. Critics to her left have also attacked Collins for her opposition to the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and for backing the Republican-sponsored tax cut, a measure that liberals criticize as a giveaway to the rich.\n\nCollins' role as a juror in Trump's impeachment trial will be closely watched. Unlike some of her Republican colleagues, who have said they will not be impartial in the process, Collins has repeatedly said she has an open mind.\n\nI think it's important not to prejudge the facts of the case or the evidence that is presented, Collins told NPR.\n\nHer announcement Wednesday that she will try to stay New England's only Republican U.S. senator comes hours before the House is poised to impeach the president on charges that he obstructed Congress and abused power. That move would set up a January trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, a process that is expected to acquit Trump.\n\nIn her remarks to supporters, Collins acknowledged the political polarization of the moment, presenting herself as a someone who can work to build consensus.\n\nTo say that these are difficult and contentious times is most certainly an understatement, she said. But our country has confronted much more challenging times in our history.\n\nAt least four Democrats are expected to face off to win their party's nomination in order to face Collins in November 2020. Collins will enter the race with an $8.6 million reelection war chest, and she is running television ads statewide portraying herself as an independent, bipartisan senator.\n\nCollins, who says she did not vote for Trump in 2016, has yet to say whether she will support him in 2020.
Amy Coney Barrett: A Dream For The Right, Nightmare For The Left\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP\n\nPresident Trump's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seen as a home run for conservatives. It is a chance to move the high court in a far more aggressively conservative direction for generations.\n\nIn political terms, Barrett is the dream candidate for conservative Republicans and the nightmare candidate for Democrats.\n\nFor Republicans, the 48-year-old is a young and personally unassailable nominee.\n\nA devout Catholic, she is the mother of seven, including a child with Down syndrome and two children she and her husband, Jesse Barrett, adopted from Haiti. She is beloved in her community and by her students at Notre Dame Law School, where she taught for 15 years; she was voted best professor three times and still teaches part time at the school.\n\nIf you talk to students, the thing that stands out to them is that she really makes an effort to get to know them, understand them, and help them, says G. Marcus Cole, dean of the law school.\n\nIt's more than that, though. Barrett is willing to go the extra mile when necessary — for instance, going to bat for Laura Wolk, a blind student who upon entering the law school, found the school computer software didn't allow her to access law books and other legal material in a format she needed to read for her classes. As Wolk recounts, when she told Barrett about it, Barrett replied, This is one I absolutely can take off your plate.\n\nAnd she did, getting the law school to quickly purchase the needed software, says Wolk, who would go on to graduate second in her class and serve as a law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nBarrett's busy schedule and her many roles leave people in South Bend, Ind., scratching their heads and asking this question: How does she do it?\n\nShe starts most days at the gym at 4 a.m., according to friends. Because the appeals court she sits on meets in Chicago, she commutes regularly, driving 1 hour and 45 minutes to get there from South Bend.\n\nNobody seriously disputes Barrett's sparkling intellect and qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. Rather, it is her work on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and her scholarly writing and commentary that have drawn such fervent opposition from the left and support from the right.\n\nIt is the positions that she has taken over the years, from the anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage letter from Catholic women that she signed in 2015, to her judicial decisions since then.\n\nA sea change for the Supreme Court\n\nBarrett has criticized the Supreme Court's 5-4 and 6-3 decisions upholding key sections of Obamacare. Both were written by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, but in a 2015 interview on NPR, Barrett opined that in her view the dissenters had the better of the argument.\n\nIn a lecture at Jacksonville University in 2016 just days before the election, Barrett warned that if Hillary Clinton were elected, the court would experience a sea change in ideology. But as Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice puts it, it is Barrett's ideology that now presents a potential sea change.\n\nAron says President Trump has made clear his two qualifications for a Supreme Court justice: She must be opposed to Roe v. Wade, and the candidate has to, like Trump, do whatever she can to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Aron, and others, contend that Barrett's record fits the bill on both counts, and much more.\n\nBarrett, in her Jacksonville lecture, said she expected that the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision would be hollowed out, but not reversed.\n\nI think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion, she said.\n\nJust months after that speech, Barrett was named to the 7th Circuit, where she dissented in an abortion case involving an Indiana law barring abortions based on fetal disability or gender. While the dissenters technically did not decide the issue, they made clear their view that what they referred to as an anti-eugenics law should be upheld by the Supreme Court. Had that view prevailed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in Indiana because of fetal disability.\n\nA potential vote to overturn crucial cases\n\nNow, in 2020, if she is confirmed, Barrett would likely be a sixth conservative vote on the court, making it plausible that there will be a majority to overturn Roe v. Wade outright.\n\nUniversity of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck says he expects that with Barrett's confirmation, the court would be transformed into the most conservative court since the 1930s, a court that is much more aggressive in its conservative agenda.\n\nWhen it comes to big picture cases, running the spectrum from abortion to religion to campaign finance to everything, there is no longer going to be ... any concern about a squishy median when you have six solid conservatives from which to find five justices to form a majority, Vladeck said.\n\nBarrett closely identifies with the justice she once clerked for, the late Antonin Scalia, who more than any other justice popularized the idea of originalism, meaning that the court should interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended by the Founders. But Scalia, at the same time, often referred to himself as a faint-hearted originalist because he also embraced one of the other building blocks of legal interpretation, namely, adhering to precedent, even when, in his view, some of those precedents conflicted with what the Founding Fathers thought when they ratified the Constitution.\n\nJudge Barrett's views on precedent, however, appear to be closer to those of Justice Clarence Thomas, who has little regard for precedent and has urged overturning many long-established decisions.\n\nBarrett's critics, for instance, point to her judicial writing in a major gun case. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that the Constitution guarantees the right to own a gun. But Justice Scalia, writing for the court, listed some exceptions, among them laws barring felons from owning guns. When one of those felon laws came before Judge Barrett, she dissented, maintaining that the Supreme Court didn't really mean to exclude gun ownership for felons who aren't dangerous.
Paul Ryan Sells Health Care Bill As A 'Once-In-A-Lifetime Opportunity'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThis is the chance. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, said the speaker, roving the stage with a wireless mic, gesturing at both the audience in front of him and the PowerPoint presentation behind him.\n\nTED Talk? Late-night infomercial? Nope — it was House Speaker Paul Ryan, making a hard pitch for his health care plan after a week of loud conservative criticism.\n\nAfter listening to conservative groups like the Club For Growth blast the bill as a warmed-over substitute for government-run health care, Ryan went on offense, saying this is just the first step of an ongoing overhaul of the health system.\n\nThe bill, drafted by Ryan and other House Republican leaders, cleared a key hurdle Thursday, passing two House committees after marathon markup sessions. But many members from the Tea Party wing are upset that it keeps too much of the Affordable Care Act in place and effectively replaces the law's signature tax with a heavy surcharge assessed to people who forgo health insurance.\n\nThere are only so many things you can do in that bill because of Senate floor rules, reconciliation, Ryan said. You can't put everything you want in that legislation, because if you did it would be filibustered, and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the Senate.\n\nThen Ryan applied some public pressure. We as Republicans have been waiting seven years to do this. We as Republicans, who fought the creation of [Obamacare], and accurately predicted it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, on a promise that if given the ability we would repeal and replace this law.\n\nThis is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here; the time is now. This is the moment, said Ryan, summing up the situation as a binary choice for Republicans: Ditch Obamacare, or keep it.\n\nRyan's pitch comes at a time when many key trade groups are voicing major concerns about the repeal. The American Medical Association sent a letter to lawmakers bemoaning an expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.\n\nThe American Hospital Association urged Republican leaders to wait until the Congressional Budget Office analyzes the bill.\n\nThat's something Democrats are homing in on. Look: No one likes this bill, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Hospitals, doctors, governors. Conservatives, liberals, nonpartisan groups. And most of all, the people who would no longer have affordable health care.\n\nWe Democrats are here today to tell our Republican friends, turn back. Drop this irresponsible plan.\n\nCurrently, Ryan and other Republican leaders don't need Democrats to pass the bill. They can afford to ignore Schumer.\n\nBut with just a two-vote margin in the Senate, they can't ignore Republican senators. So it was notable when Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted that the House bill won't be able to win a Senate majority. To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio voiced similar worries to the New York Times. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want the bill on President Trump's desk by the end of April. I think if that's the approach they take, they won't have the votes in the Senate, Rubio warned.\n\nThat's why Republican leaders have now pulled out all the stops in their attempts to get rank-and-file members on board. As Schumer and other Democrats were blasting the bill outside the Senate on Thursday morning, they had to raise their voices at one point to speak over sirens.\n\nIt was Vice President Pence's motorcade driving by. He was back on Capitol Hill for the second time this week, meeting with fellow Republicans to talk and pitch the health care bill.
'The Fall Of Wisconsin' Puts The State's 2016 Presidential Choice In Context\n\nEnlarge this image Samantha Clark/NPR Samantha Clark/NPR\n\nThe election night map in 2016 brought many surprises, but none more stunning than Wisconsin's switch from blue to red — marking its first vote for a Republican presidential ticket since 1984.\n\nMichigan and Pennsylvania also ended long Democratic streaks that night. But the Badger State was the big shock, because Barack Obama had carried it twice by comfortable margins and Hillary Clinton had led all through the fall in the most respected statewide poll.\n\nPresident Trump himself has since seemed fixated on his Wisconsin win, if fuzzy on the details. Last month, while visiting that state, Trump claimed to have been the first Republican to win there since Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. (In fact, the GOP's presidential nominee won the state five times between Ike and Trump: Reagan in 1984 and 1980 and Richard Nixon in 1972, 1968 and 1960.)\n\nBut the president is not the only one getting Wisconsin wrong. Assumptions based on fleeting impressions have long led outsiders to misinterpret what goes on between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi.\n\nEnter Dan Kaufman, who grew up in Wisconsin and now writes for magazines in New York. In The Fall of Wisconsin: The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics (Norton), he tries to explain what happened in 2016 as part of a far larger story.\n\nHis message is twofold. First, he explains that the shock of Trump's win in Wisconsin in 2016 was misplaced. Yes, Obama had won there twice, but his wins stood in stark contrast to what was going on in the state during his years in office — a drastic rightward shift in the state's power arrangements from the top statewide jobs to the local precinct level.\n\nSecond, Kaufman argues that what's been happening in Wisconsin has historical significance because it made the state a model for conservative activists who, with corporate backing, were remarkably successful in reversing the state's deeper tradition of progressive populism that dates from the 1800s.\n\nEven casual students of history have heard of Robert La Follette, champion of the common man and longtime statewide hero. The original Fighting Bob served as governor, senator and presidential candidate in the early 20th century and remains a beacon to progressives today. Some also know that Milwaukee routinely elected socialist mayors for nearly half a century.\n\nBut Wisconsin's political history is nothing if not complicated and often contradictory. The state that produced Fighting Bob also gave the world Joseph R. McCarthy, the notorious red-baiting senator who made McCarthyism an epithet.\n\nThe Fall of Wisconsin The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics by Dan Kaufman Hardcover, 319 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThe state that sent to the Senate Gaylord Nelson, the father of Earth Day, also elected Sen. William Proxmire, the maverick known for his Golden Fleece awards that pilloried government waste. And the state's current brace of senators, Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin, share little in common beyond the state flag.\n\nKaufman does include in these pages some of the elements of Wisconsin history that further cloud its image as a progressive bastion. There were generations of fierce resistance to unionization, strikes that lasted for years, violence that took lives. He even unearths a particularly eye-opening episode in the 1960s, when Alabama's segregationist Gov. George Wallace came to the state and did rather well in the Democratic presidential primary – not once but twice.\n\nPerhaps no one can reconcile all this and establish a single narrative for the Wisconsin story. And Kaufman does not try to disentangle all the strands of populist versus intellectual progressivism. Instead, his account returns repeatedly to the trials of the present moment.\n\nThat more contemporary story begins as Republican Scott Walker wins the governorship in 2010, the Tea Party year, running against Obamacare and the Democratic power structure in Madison, the state capital. Walker would drive legislation known as Act 10 to take down the public employee unions (including their right to collective bargaining). He would then survive a recall, win re-election and push new legislation to make Wisconsin a right-to-work state in 2015, breaking a promise he had made to the private sector unions.\n\nKaufman spends relatively little time on the cities of Milwaukee and Madison, taking the reader instead to South Wayne and Ashland and Baraboo Hills. Here is where he finds the roots of what has been happening to Wisconsin politics and where he spreads his conclusions farther across the political landscape.\n\nThe lens widens to take in the struggles of the Upper Midwest, the hollowing out of small-town America and the complicated ways in which working people sometimes work against their own best interests.\n\nIn this regard, Kaufman's work belongs with well-known recent studies such as J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Arlie Russell Hochschild's Strangers in Their Own Land — examinations of alienation among rural (or until recently rural) Americans. Kaufman finds much the same core values and deep resentments in the Upper Midwest that these authors have found elsewhere.\n\nBut Kaufman is not satisfied with blaming the people's anger alone for what has happened in Wisconsin. He explores other more deliberate and systemic factors that dragged down Clinton and other Democrats in recent election cycles.\n\nHe argues that Walker's voter ID law suppressed turnout in Milwaukee and that the influx of money from conservative political action committees taking advantage of Citizens United inundated candidates at the local and statewide level. For example, he reports the Democratic candidate against Walker in the 2012 recall election spent $4 million to Walker's $30 million.\n\nHe also devotes a chapter to the famous legislative district maps that allowed Republicans to win a supermajority of the seats in the State Assembly in 2012 despite receiving less than half the statewide vote for those offices. (A lawsuit challenging these maps made it to the U.S. Supreme Court this spring but was sent back down on a procedural issue.)\n\nPerhaps the one issue that recurs most often in Kaufman's diagnosis is the near extinction of unions as a political force. Private sector union participation was down to 8 percent by 2016, he says, and those who remained were not nearly numerous or generous enough to compete with the GOP's coffers.\n\nKaufman marshals copious data in making his case. But his story comes to life through his profiles of key players in his home state. Most are progressive Democrats or activists who have been resisting the state's rightward shift for years. These include current and former legislators such as Tim Cullen and Chris Taylor and candidates who ran quixotic challenges to entrenched incumbents.\n\nOne whose name may already be familiar is Randy Bryce, an ironworker who grew up in Milwaukee and now lives in the congressional district of Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. Bryce had been running a long-shot campaign against Ryan this year until the speaker decided to retire. Now Bryce, known as IronStache for his facial hair and social media handle, has at least a chance to go to Washington.\n\nBryce is an Army vet, raised by a Milwaukee beat cop as a conservative. As an ironworker, he has helped build some of the iconic structures in his original hometown — the ballpark, the Harley-Davidson Museum. But he was politicized by veterans' health issues, then by labor issues and finally by Walker and the campaign against unions. He took part in the massive protests that tried to block Act 10 in the Legislature and he tried to rally organized labor against Walker in his subsequent campaigns.\n\nWe do meet a few Republicans. One is Eric O'Keefe of the Wisconsin Club for Growth, who has been involved in the Republican revolution of the past 10 years and makes a case for lower taxes and paring back the power of public employees. Another is Dale Schultz, who represented a rural southwestern Wisconsin district in the state Senate for decades but bailed out after resisting Walker.\n\nSchultz provides a pithy analysis of what happened in the fall of 2016, recalling how many of his constituents were attracted to Bernie Sanders: Once [Sanders] was out and it was just Hillary and Donald Trump, the anger shifted over and got behind Trump because they didn't care. They just wanted to crush the establishment.\n\nIn his final chapter, Kaufman returns to the quotation that begins his book. It is from Edward G. Ryan, who was Wisconsin's chief justice in 1873 and foresaw the protracted struggle of the next century and a half with striking clarity.\n\nThe question will arise ... Which shall rule: wealth or man? Which shall lead, money or intellect? Who shall fill public stations, educated and patriotic freemen or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?\n\nKaufman's overarching point is that this question from 1873 is not asked once and answered. It is a question posed repeatedly in every generation, and every generation must provide its own answer.
Trump's And Biden's Plans For Health Care\n\nEnlarge this image Caroline Amenabar/NPR; Wil Taylor/Flickr Caroline Amenabar/NPR; Wil Taylor/Flickr\n\nKey priorities\n\nJoe Biden\n\nCreate a public option health care plan that expands off the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDecrease the price of prescription drugs.\n\nProtect abortion access.\n\nInvest $775 billion in child and elder care.\n\nRead details of Biden's plans below.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nRepeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a new plan, which has not been publicly proposed.\n\nLower the price of prescription drugs and insurance premiums.\n\nRead details of Trump's plans below.\n\nBiden's plans for health care\n\nBiden's health care plan centers around reinforcing and expanding the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare — via a public option while also improving access to care.\n\nThe public option plan is described as available to all Americans, whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, adding that the option is like Medicare — but is not Medicare.\n\nThe public option would be offered with no premiums to Americans who live in states that don't have access to Medicaid benefits that they would qualify for in other states.\n\nThough not explicitly mentioned in his proposal, Biden has said that undocumented immigrants would be able to buy into the public option plan and receive unsubsidized coverage — an option currently not allowed under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn terms of lowering costs on the individual health insurance marketplace, his proposal would do away with the income cap — which currently stands at 400% of the federal poverty line — that enables eligibility to receive a tax credit to help pay for premiums. The plan also would ensure that no household is putting more than 8.5% of their earnings (instead of the current 9.86%) into health insurance plans.\n\nBiden's proposal would work to lower prescription drug prices within Medicare, create an independent commission to oversee and regulate the price of new drugs, and get rid of the tax breaks given to pharmaceutical corporations on advertising.\n\nOn abortion access, Biden is in favor of restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. He does not support the so-called gag rule or the Hyde Amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortions. Biden backed the Hyde Amendment for a significant portion of his career and only came out against the legislation in July 2019, saying he could no longer support an amendment that makes that right [to an abortion] dependent on someone's ZIP code.\n\nBiden also wants to allocate $775 billion toward a plan for child and elder care. A lot of the funding would go toward cutting Medicaid waitlists for people needing home and community care, and to provide tax breaks to people who care for older family members.\n\nBiden also pledges to invest in further health care employment, training 35,000 workers on how to aid Americans suffering from opioid addictions and adding tens of thousands of new jobs caring for veterans.\n\nBiden also calls for the creation of a public health jobs corps, which would employ more than 100,000 Americans as health care workers in medically underserved communities to work in disease prevention.\n\nTrump's plans for health care\n\nAmong items on his second-term agenda bullet points, Trump wants to lower the prices of prescription drugs, lower insurance premiums and provide access to coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions.\n\nTrump is against keeping the Affordable Care Act, but he hasn't proposed a detailed alternative. During an ABC town hall last month, Trump was unable to explain his campaign's proposed alternative other than saying the current law is too expensive. He also did not outline a plan in the first presidential debate against Biden.\n\nThe Trump administration and several Republican-led states are arguing at the Supreme Court that the Affordable Care Act should now be void — an argument that would end existing protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nTrump has attempted to usher through prescription drug reforms via a series of executive orders signed in July and September, though the timeline for seeing these policies implemented remains uncertain. A notable order would lower drug prices for those on Medicare parts B and D to comparable costs seen internationally.\n\nHe also pledged to send $200 drug cards to all Americans using Medicare in an effort to supplement the cost of prescription drugs — though health experts are skeptical of the plan's long-term benefits for lowering prices. Plus the White House's suggested process for paying for the plan remains uncertain.\n\nTrump has also backed an end to surprise billing, which members of Congress have sought to take up.\n\nSee more of the major presidential candidates' key policy agendas here.\n\nNPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political correspondent Asma Khalid contributed to this report.
Likely 2020 Democratic Candidates Want To Guarantee A Job To Every American\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe 2018 midterm primary season is really heating up this week, which means it's time to think about elections — like the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\n\nNo major candidates have declared that they're preparing a run against President Trump in two years, but whispers are building around potential candidates. A few of them have coalesced around a seriously ambitious policy idea — guaranteeing a job for every American who wants one.\n\nIf enacted, such a program could be big or small; it could create massive reverberations in the private sector; and it could reshape monetary policy. One thing that is more certain is that Americans will be hearing about the idea of job guarantees for the next few years.\n\nBut why now?\n\nMy impression is it may have been the shock effect of Trump's election and the recognition that there are a host of policies, projects, that we previously didn't think were imaginable or reasonable that are being considered on the other end of the political spectrum, said William Darity, an economist at Duke University and a proponent of job guarantee programs.\n\nOn top of that, even before Trump won the presidency, 2016 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders also showed that voters could be won over by a Democratic Socialist, as he describes himself, who proposed massive, progressive policy overhauls that opponents also derided as being unfeasible. Sanders of Vermont is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nProposals like a job guarantee, Medicare for all and tuition-free college have moved from the policy fringe on the left toward the mainstream in the Democratic Party, embraced by some of those interested in challenging Trump as the party tries to give voters a clear, memorable outline of what Democrats stand for.\n\nSo here's a primer on jobs guarantees — what they are, how they would work, and why we're hearing about them when unemployment is already really low.\n\nWhat is a jobs guarantee?\n\nA jobs guarantee program can take different forms, but the basic idea behind any program is the same, according to Darity.\n\nUnder the conditions of a federal job guarantee, everybody would be assured of getting to work if they were seeking work. So in effect, the unemployment rate would be zero, said Darity. In an ideal world, if I lost my job in the morning, I could walk over to what we would now truly call an employment office and have new work by the afternoon.\n\nThis separates it from a job subsidy program, he said, in which the government would help boost the number of jobs — perhaps massively so — but neither create all those jobs itself nor guarantee the jobs to those seeking one.\n\nThe idea is that the job guarantee program could be what economists call an automatic stabilizer — a program that grows when the economy is in a downturn and shrinks when things are going well.\n\nBut many job guarantee programs are about more than just assuring a certain quantity of jobs; they also focus on quality.\n\nSeveral plans — one co-designed by Darity, a proposal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another outline from Sanders — also would provide wages much higher than the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25) and benefits that are unheard of for many current low-wage workers.\n\nThe idea is that we would then drive bad jobs out of existence, said Darity, because no one would be obligated to take those jobs since they would have a superior option.\n\nAll of which is to say: This is a big policy idea. Implementing a job guarantee would make the federal government the employer for potentially millions — or even tens of millions — of Americans.\n\nWho is backing one?\n\nMost notably: Booker, New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sanders. In addition, The Intercept recently reported that Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren has begun looking closely at the idea.\n\nThose aren't necessarily the only members of Congress who believe in job guarantees, but they do happen to all be oft-mentioned as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nBooker is the only one of these three with a fully fleshed-out proposal out there. His plan, unveiled late in April, would create pilot job guarantee programs in 15 communities where unemployment is particularly high.\n\nAll of the jobs would give people paid family and sick leave, pay that eventually phases up to $15 an hour, and — according to Booker's website — health coverage like that enjoyed by Members of Congress.\n\nGillibrand, Warren and fellow Democatic Sens. Kamala Harris and Jeff Merkley co-sponsored that bill. (Harris of California and Merkley of Oregon have also hinted at possible 2020 campaigns.)\n\nSanders also has a proposal in the works. An outline provided to NPR shows the plan would be more sweeping than Booker's pilot program by establishing 2,500 job centers nationwide.\n\nGillibrand's office tells NPR that she has a plan forthcoming, to be released in the next few weeks.\n\nEconomists have also proposed having the Labor Department invest in creating jobs in the fields of child care and building infrastructure or setting up arrangements such as community job banks where jobs that can be filled immediately would be posted.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA job for everyone sounds great. What could go wrong?\n\nProblem No. 1 is you're not just going to get people who have been unable to find work in the private sector for whatever reason, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum. You're going to get a lot of people. And a lot of people means a lot of money, so the federal budget is going to explode.\n\nAnd with that could come another problem, Holtz-Eakin said: An expensive program could mean tax hikes. And he fears those tax hikes could exacerbate the problems that a jobs guarantee is designed to help.\n\nYou're going to actually undermine the private economy that's needed to pay those bills. So it doesn't really add up, he added.\n\nBut beyond the cost, there are other major potential problems. One is that businesses would have to substantially raise prices in order to compensate their employees competitively with the new government jobs.\n\nIt's also possible that the federal government, by investing all this money into the labor market, would crowd out the private sector, competing with businesses for labor and stifling growth.\n\nProponents argue the policy's critics are overstating the potential dangers. For one, they say the program would at least partly pay for itself.\n\nI mean, if you look at all of these programs that are trying to make up for either no work or inadequate paying work as companies outsource their labor costs on us, the taxpayers, Booker said, those programs alone are worth billions and billions of dollars.\n\nAs far as higher prices, Darity believes that is not a serious argument against a job guarantee.\n\nInsofar as we're maintaining an environment in which prices are lower for products because people are poorly paid, I think that that's a real ethical concern for any society, he said.\n\nAnd it may be possible to avoid the crowding-out phenomenon, economist Conor Sen recently argued (Sen, to be clear, isn't a proponent of the plans — in fact, he says he feels skepticism about the idea). His idea is to make sure the program's funding is countercyclical — that is, that it shrinks in good times and grows in bad.\n\nThis sounds ... out of the ordinary as far as policies go.\n\nIt is. Even for Darity, who has been a fan of job guarantees for years, it's strange to have the idea in the mainstream.\n\nIt's a little bit surreal, because for such a long period of time, there were some of us who were talking about this, and we were roundly dismissed or ignored, and now it looks like it's something people are viewing as a credible policy option, he said.\n\nWait. I keep hearing we're near full employment. Why put this plan out there now?\n\nFull employment doesn't mean that everyone who wants a job has one. It's a term economists use to describe, roughly speaking, the lowest the unemployment rate can be expected to go at any given time. Try to pull it even lower, the idea goes, and inflation would be the result.\n\nThe current unemployment rate of 3.9 percent refers to the portion of people who are actively looking for work right now who can't find a job.\n\nBut then, there are people working part time who want full-time work, and there are discouraged workers who have stopped looking for work. Those people are not counted in the headline unemployment rate. But count all of them, and by its broadest definition, unemployment stands at around 7.8 percent.\n\nOn top of all that, in good times and bad, some people persistently just can't find work.\n\nHere we are at 4 percent unemployment, and we still have lots of pockets of insufficient opportunity, said Jared Bernstein, former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. So we need a jobs program.\n\nThat insufficient opportunity he talks about hits some groups particularly hard.\n\nThe black unemployment rate is always twice that of the white rate, he added. And I gotta tell you, that's not written in the Good Book somewhere. That's the outcome of a persistent market failure that's very much leavened by racial discrimination.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call\n\nDoesn't that make the term full employment misleading?\n\nYeah, probably. Even at full employment, some groups are persistently far more fully employed than others.\n\nIt's not that the U.S. hasn't done a major jobs program before. It has — Darity said his job guarantee plan is comparable to the employment programs of the Great Depression, like the Works Progress Administration. However, he adds that there are key distinctions.\n\nWhat's different about the job guarantee is that it is universal and it's permanent. So it's an option that would exist not only in times of massive unemployment, but it also would exist in times where the unemployment rate is lower, Darity said. But we still have large numbers of bad jobs. It's not just an emergency.\n\nThe point, proponents say, isn't just to keep unemployment from skyrocketing during recessions; it's to correct labor market problems that persist even when unemployment is low. And even people opposed to the idea of job guarantees agree that those problems need fixing.\n\nThe reason you don't want to be dismissive of the intent of people who propose these things is there is a set of workers out there who aren't getting jobs no matter how well the economy is performing, said Holtz-Eakin.\n\nSo candidates are proposing this just because they think it's the right thing to do?\n\nCandidates don't tend to put out sweeping proposals because of economics alone.\n\nSo why — politically — is this happening now? One explanation is that Democrats are trying to rebuild after a devastating election in 2016, which many emerged from thinking the party didn't have a clear message for what it stood for.\n\nIf the party nominates a candidate in 2020 who embraces a job guarantee program, Medicare for all and tuition-free or debt-free college, it will send a clear signal that the party has embraced a progressive platform well to the left of where it has been for decades.\n\nI do think it is further to the left than what you've seen from Democratic politicians probably since the Obamacare debate, said Adam Jentleson, who served as deputy chief of staff to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. But that represents where the party is headed and not just where the party is right now, but where Democrats think the party is likely to be in the heat of the 2020 campaign.\n\nA policy like a job guarantee could help win over the left wing of the party. But it's also the kind of idea that may never be much more than a campaign promise.
